Using the classical AST mouse model (KrasLSL-G12D/+;Lkb1flox/flox, KL), we here comprehensively analyze the temporal transcriptomic dynamics of lung tumors at different stages by dynamic network biomarker (DNB) and identify the tipping point at which the Wnt signaling is abruptly suppressed by the excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through its downstream effector FOXO3A. Bidirectional genetic perturbation of the Wnt pathway using two different Ctnnb1 conditional knockout mouse strains confirms its essential role in the negative regulation of AST. Importantly, pharmacological activation of the Wnt pathway before but not after the tipping point inhibits squamous transdifferentiation, highlighting the irreversibility of AST after crossing the tipping point. Through comparative transcriptomic analyses of mouse and human tumors, we find that the lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma form a “Yin-Yang” counteracting network. Interestingly, inactivation of the Wnt pathway preferentially suppresses the adenomatous lineage TF network and thus disrupts the “Yin-Yang” homeostasis to lean towards the squamous lineage, whereas ectopic expression of NKX2-1, an adenomatous lineage TF, significantly dampens such phenotypic transition accelerated by the Wnt pathway inactivation. The negative correlation between the Wnt pathway and AST is further observed in a large cohort of human lung adenosquamous carcinoma. Collectively, our study identifies the tipping point of AST and highlights an essential role of the ROS-Wnt axis in dynamically orchestrating the homeostasis between adeno- and squamous-specific TF networks at the AST tipping point.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1673395200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673395200,"objectID":"45c682352cd2949c2d41491304c3815e","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36627278/","publishdate":"2023-01-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36627278/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nLkb1 deficiency confers the Kras-mutant lung cancer with strong plasticity and the potential for adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation (AST).

The role of hypercapnia on lung repair after injury is not completely understood. Here, using a mouse model of hypercapnia exposure, cell lineage-tracing, spatial transcriptomics and 3D-cultures, we show that hypercapnia limits β-catenin signaling in AT2 cells, leading to their reduced proliferative capacity. Hypercapnia alters expression of major Wnts in PDGFRα+-fibroblasts from those maintaining AT2 progenitor activity towards those that antagonize β-catenin signaling thereby limiting progenitor function. Constitutive activation of β-catenin signaling in AT2 cells or treatment of organoid cultures with recombinant WNT3A protein bypasses the inhibitory effects of hypercapnia. Inhibition of AT2 proliferation in hypercapnic patients may contribute to impaired lung repair after injury, preventing sealing of the epithelial barrier, increasing lung flooding, ventilator dependency and mortality.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1673308800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673308800,"objectID":"616da16c78b538aa9620506c9e4566b8","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36626234/","publishdate":"2023-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36626234/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nPersistent symptoms and radiographic abnormalities suggestive of failed lung repair are among the most common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge.

Here, we determined the potential of positron emission tomography (PET) of chemokine-like receptor-1 (CMKLR1) to monitor lung inflammation in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide-induced injury. Lung uptake of a CMKLR1-targeting radiotracer, [64Cu]NODAGA-CG34, was significantly increased in lipopolysaccharide-induced injury, correlated with the expression of multiple inflammatory markers, and reduced by dexamethasone treatment. Monocyte-derived macrophages, followed by interstitial macrophages and monocytes were the major CMKLR1-expressing leukocytes contributing to the increased tracer uptake throughout the first week of lipopolysaccharide-induced injury. The clinical relevance of CMKLR1 as a biomarker of lung inflammation in ARDS was confirmed using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets which showed significant increases in CMKLR1 expression among transcriptionally distinct subsets of lung monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 patients vs. controls.

Fibroblasts exist across a spectrum of states, from quiescence in health to activated myofibroblasts in the setting of injury. Highly activated myofibroblasts have a critical role in the establishment of fibrosis as the predominant source of type 1 collagen and pro-fibrotic mediators. Myofibroblasts are also highly contractile cells and can alter lung biomechanical properties through tissue contraction. . One of the ways myofibroblast activation occurs is through activation of the Rho/myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) / serum response factor (SRF) pathway, which signals through intracellular actin polymerization. However, concerns surrounding the pleiotropic and ubiquitous nature of these signaling pathways have limited the translation of inhibitory drugs. Herein, we demonstrate a novel therapeutic anti-fibrotic strategy utilizing myofibroblast-targeted nanoparticles containing a MTRF/SRF pathway inhibitor (CCG-1423) which has been shown to block myofibroblast activation in vitro. Myofibroblasts were preferentially targeted via the angiotensin 2 receptor, which has been shown to be selectively upregulated in animal and human studies. These nanoparticles were non-toxic and accumulated in lung myofibroblasts in the bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, reducing the number of these activated cells and their production of pro-fibrotic mediators. Ultimately, in a murine model of lung fibrosis, a single injection of these drug containing targeted nanoagents reduced fibrosis as compared to control mice. This approach has the potential to deliver personalized therapy by precisely targeting signaling pathways in a cell-specific manner, allowing increased efficacy with reduced deleterious off-target effects.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1673308800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673308800,"objectID":"8d4de5550408100e783bea05bcf61101","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36625494/","publishdate":"2023-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36625494/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nPulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of myofibroblasts in the lung and progressive tissue scarring.

N-myristoyl transferase 1 (NMT1) was identified as a target protein of desloratadine by drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Upregulation of NMT1 expression enhanced but NMT1 knockdown suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Metabolic labeling and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that Visinin-like protein 3 (VILIP3) was a new substrate of NMT1 in protein N-myristoylation modification, and high NMT1 or VILIP3 expression was associated with advanced stages and poor survival in HCC. Mechanistically, desloratadine binds to Asn-246 in NMT1 and inhibits its enzymatic activity, disrupting the NMT1-mediated myristoylation of the VILIP3 protein and subsequent NFκB/Bcl-2 signaling. Conclusively, this study demonstrates that desloratadine may be a novel anticancer drug and that NMT1-mediated myristoylation contributes to HCC progression and is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1673222400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673222400,"objectID":"96e0b75d9c05eb050afbd629c27e7030","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36617552/","publishdate":"2023-01-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36617552/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors.

The clinical course of ALI/ARDS is variable; however, it has been reported that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) play a role in its development. The fragile chromosomal site gene WWOX is highly sensitive to genotoxic stress induced by environmental exposure and is an important candidate gene for exposure-related lung disease research. However, the expression of WWOX and its role in LPS-induced ALI still remain unidentified. This study investigated the expression of WWOX in mouse lung and epithelial cells and explored the role of WWOX in LPS-induced ALI model in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we explored one of the possible mechanisms by which WWOX alleviates ALI from the perspective of autophagy. Here, we observed that LPS stimulation reduced the expression of WWOX and the autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3β-II (MAP1LC3B/LC3B) in mouse lung epithelial and human epithelial (H292) cells. Overexpression of WWOX led to the activation of autophagy and inhibited inflammatory responses in LPS-induced ALI cells and mouse model. More importantly, we found that WWOX interacts with mechanistic target of rapamycin [serine/threonine kinase] (mTOR) and regulates mTOR and ULK-1 signaling-mediated autophagy. Thus, reduced WWOX levels were associated with LPS-induced ALI. WWOX can activate autophagy in lung epithelial cells and protect against LPS-induced ALI, which is partly related to the mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1672963200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672963200,"objectID":"ee7d55742ba0fa0f989263794ffde506","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36621327/","publishdate":"2023-01-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36621327/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nAcute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by acute systemic inflammatory responses that may lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

In this study, the nanocarrier of CD44-specific ligand Hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified milk-derived exosomes (mExo) encapsulated with FA (HA-mExo-FA) is developed. As a result, HA modification could deliver drug-loaded exosomes to the target cells and form a specific ligand-receptor interaction with CD44, thus improving the anti-liver fibrosis effect of FA.

Then, we used self-establishing metabolically cooperating communities (SeMeCo) as a tool to increase metabolite exchange and observed significant lifespan extensions. The longevity of the SeMeCo was attributable to metabolic reconfigurations in methionine consumer cells.

The currently available diagnostic tools for CRC are either invasive or insensitive to early lesions due to the dearth of reliable biomarkers. In this study, we discovered that the extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the faeces of CRC patients can act as a potent biomarker for the non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of CRC. This finding is based on the identification of two transmembrane proteins-CD147 and A33-on faeces-derived EVs (fEVs) that are intrinsically associated with CRC. The detection results show that the levels of CD147 and A33 on fEVs were upregulated in the CRC patients (n = 48), dramatically distinguishing them from the healthy donors (n = 16). The CD147/A33-enriched EVs offer a clinical sensitivity of 89%, much higher than that (40%) of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a clinically-established serum biomarker for CRC diagnosis.

Interferon-inducible 2’-5’ oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) protein is devoid of enzymatic function but displays potent antiviral activity. Here we describe a role of OASL as a virus-induced necroptosis promoter that scaffolds the RIPK3-ZBP1 non-canonical necrosome via liquid-like phase condensation.

This process facilitates the amyloid-like fibril formation and activation of RIPK3 and thereby MLKL phosphorylation for necroptosis. Mice deficient in Oasl1 exhibit severely impaired necroptosis and attenuated inflammation after viral infection, resulting in uncontrolled viral dissemination and lethality.

To address these challenges, we developed FIND-seq (Focused Interrogation of cells by Nucleic acid Detection and Sequencing), a high-throughput microfluidic cytometry method that combines encapsulation of cells in droplets, PCR-based detection of target nucleic acids, and droplet sorting to enable in-depth transcriptomic analyses of cells of interest at single-cell resolution.

Accordingly, knockout of Trim27 in mice causes spontaneously occurring IBS-like symptoms, including increased visceral hyperalgesia and abnormal stool features, as observed in IBS patients. Mechanistically, TRIM27 stabilizes β-catenin and thus activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote intestinal stem cell (ISC) self-renewal. Consistent with these findings, Trim27 deficiency disrupts organoid formation, which is rescued by reintroducing TRIM27 or β-catenin. Furthermore, Wnt/β-catenin signaling activator treatment ameliorates IBS symptoms by promoting ISC self-renewal. Taken together, these data indicate that TRIM27 is critical for maintaining gut homeostasis, suggesting that targeting the TRIM27/Wnt/β-catenin axis could be a potential treatment strategy for IBS.

The viral infectivity and immune resistance of variants are generally incompatible, except for limited variants such as Beta and Kappa. The Omicron variant has the highest immune resistance but showed high infectivity in only one of the tested cell lines. To provide cross-clade immunity against variants that undergo diverse evolutionary pathways, we designed a new pan-vaccine antigen (Span). Span was designed by analyzing the homology of 2675 SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequences from the NCBI database before the Delta variant emerged. The refined Span protein harbors high-frequency residues at given positions that reflect cross-clade generality in sequence evolution. Compared with a prototype wild-type (Swt) vaccine, which, when administered to mice, induced serum with decreased neutralization activity against emerging variants, Span vaccination of mice elicited broad immunity to a wide range of variants, including those that emerged after our design.

The D-S pHLIP-anchored cTME-EVs were magnetically enriched and then analyzed with high-resolution messenger RNA sequencing, by which more than 18 times the number of TME-related differentially expressed genes and 10 times the number of hub genes were identified, compared with those achieved by the gold-standard ultracentrifugation.

Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL-99 (BL-99) can alleviate osteoporosis caused by UC, but less research has been done on other extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) caused by UC. This study aimed to explore the role and potential mechanisms of BL-99 on DSS-induced pulmonary complications in colitis mice. The results showed that BL-99 decreased weight loss, disease activity index score, colonic pathology score, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in colitis mice. BL-99 also alleviated DSS-induced lung pathological damage by suppressing the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory monocytes, and macrophages. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed lower abundances of several potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Burkholderia, Shigella, and Clostridium perfringens) and enrichment in specific beneficial bacteria (e.g., Adlercreutzia and Bifidobacterium animalis) in colitis mice with BL-99 treatment.

Finally, we observed that the pulmonary expression of primary acetate and butyrate receptors, including FFAR2, FFAR3, and, GPR109a, was up-regulated in BL-99-treated mice, which negatively correlated with inflammatory monocytes and macrophages.

However, therapeutic applications of EVs require overcoming several challenges. First, the production efficiency of MSC-EVs should be increased at least as much as the quantity of them are required to their clinical application; second, MSC-EVs needs to show various functionality further, thereby increasing tissue regeneration efficiency. In this study, we treated tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a biological derivative known to regulate cholesterol, to MSCs and investigated whether TUDCA treatment would be able to increase EV production efficiency and tissue regenerative capacity of EVs. Indeed, it appears that TUDCA priming to MSC increases the yield of MSC-EVs \u0026gt;2 times by reducing the cellular cholesterol level in MSCs and increasing the exocytosis-related CAV1 expression. Interestingly, it was found that the EVs derived from TUDCA-primed MSCs (T-EV) contained higher amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL1RN, IL6, IL10, and IL11) and osteogenic proteins (ALP, RUNX2, BMP2, BMPR1, and BMPR2) than those in control MSC-EVs (C-EV). Besides, it was shown that T-EV not only regulated M1/M2 macrophages differentiation of monocytes, also effectively increased the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs as well as bone tissue regeneration in a bone defect rat model. Based on these results, it is concluded that TUDCA treatment to MSC as a new approach endows EV with high-yield production and functionality.

Importantly, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of gut microbes from normal donors rehabilitated the GM and decreased the elevated GLU levels in TD broilers. A high GLU level is a predisposing factor to bone disease, suggesting that GM dysbiosis-mediated hyperglycaemia might be involved in bone regulation. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and short-chain fatty acid analysis revealed that the significantly increased level of the metabolite butyric acid derived from the genera Blautia and Coprococcus regulated GLU levels in TD broilers by binding to GPR109A in the pancreas. Tibial studies showed reduced expression of vascular regulatory factors (including PI3K, AKT and VEFGA) based on transcriptomics analysis and reduced vascular distribution, contributing to nonvascularization of cartilage in the proximal tibial growth plate of TD broilers with elevated GLU levels.

The core regulators of the necroptosis pathway are the kinases, RIPK1 and RIPK3, and the executioner pseudokinase, MLKL; each of these proteins is regulated by diverse interactions and modifications. Most experimental studies of necroptosis in kidney diseases have been performed in rodent models of disease; further studies are therefore essential to define the contribution of this cell death mode to human kidney diseases. RIPK1 inhibitors are currently being explored in clinical trials to treat neuronal and inflammatory diseases, but so far, the results have not been convincing; future trials are required to establish the viability of targeting necroptosis in kidney diseases. Abstract\nCell death, particularly that of tubule epithelial cells, contributes critically to the pathophysiology of kidney disease. A body of evidence accumulated over the past 15 years has ascribed a central pathophysiological role to a particular form of regulated necrosis, termed necroptosis, to acute tubular necrosis, nephron loss and maladaptive renal fibrogenesis. Unlike apoptosis, which is a non-immunogenic process, necroptosis results in the release of cellular contents and cytokines, which triggers an inflammatory response in neighbouring tissue. This necroinflammatory environment can lead to severe organ dysfunction and cause lasting tissue injury in the kidney. Despite evidence of a link between necroptosis and various kidney diseases, there are no available therapeutic options to target this process. Greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms, triggers and regulators of necroptosis in acute and chronic kidney diseases may identify shortcomings in current approaches to therapeutically target necroptosis regulators and lead to the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.\n\u0026lt; Back to Reviews Alternative to Homepage ","date":1672704000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672704000,"objectID":"d7f7067a67fbcf133e03439f3b063c02","permalink":"https://example.com/review/36596919/","publishdate":"2023-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/review/36596919/","section":"review","summary":"Key points\nNecroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that leads to cell lysis and an inflammatory response in neighbouring tissues; dysregulation of the pathway is widely implicated in kidney diseases.","tags":["Cell Death","Kidney","Necroptosis"],"title":"Role of necroptosis in kidney health and disease","type":"review"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nThe resolution of infection is an active process with specific molecular and cellular mechanisms that temper inflammation and enhance pathogen clearance.

The 3’UTR contains motifs that regulate mRNA metabolism; thus, changing the 3’UTR length via APA can significantly affect gene expression. Endochondral ossification is a central process in bone healing, but the impact of APA on gene expression during this process is unknown. Here, we report the widespread occurrence of APA, which impacts multiple pathways that are known to participate in bone healing. Importantly, the progression of endochondral ossification involves global 3’UTR shortening, which is coupled with an increased abundance of shortened transcripts relative to other transcripts; these results highlight the role of APA in promoting gene expression during endochondral bone formation. Our mechanistic studies of transcripts that undergo APA in the fracture callus revealed an intricate regulatory network in which APA enhances the expression of the collagen, type I, alpha 1 (Col1a1) and Col1a2 genes, which encode the 2 subunits of the abundantly expressed protein collagen 1. APA exerts this effect by shortening the 3’UTRs of the Col1a1 and Col1a2 mRNAs, thus removing the binding sites of miR-29a-3p, which would otherwise strongly promote the degradation of both transcripts.

Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)–a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2.

This is crucial, as cell-cell communication relies on multi-subunit protein complexes that go beyond the binary representation used in most databases and studies. CellPhoneDB integrates existing datasets that pertain to cellular communication and new manually reviewed information. CellPhoneDB utilises information from the following data bases: UniProt, Ensembl, PDB, the IMEx consortium, IUPHAR. CellPhoneDB can be used to search for a particular ligand/receptor or interrogate your own single-cell transcriptomics data. Reference(s):\nMapping the temporal and spatial dynamics of the human endometrium in vivo and in vitro\nCellPhoneDB: Inferring cell-cell communication from combined expression of multi-subunit receptor-ligand complexes\nResearch into the Human Connectome has exploded since the original Human Connectome Project grants were awarded by the NIH in 2011. Over the next decade, we expect to see dozens of new projects at institutions around the world researching aspects of how age, growth, disease, and other factors can affect the ever-changing connections in the human brain. The Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) has been chartered to help coordinate these myriad research projects, harmonize their data, and facilitate the distribution and dissemination of results. The CCF has three primary aims:\nRun a “data acquisition help desk,” to facilitate in the collection of HCP-style data for optimal comparability. Maintain and expand the HCP informatics infrastructure, to host and distribute connectome data from multiple studies on ConnectomeDB and Amazon Web Services. Serve as a “harmonization center,” to make data from multiple studies and institutions as comparable as possible. The goal of celltalker is to infer putative ligand and receptor interactions from single-cell RNAseq data. This is accomplished by evaluating known cognate ligand/receptor interactions across groups of cells. Interactions are scored by jointly weighting the expression levels of ligands and receptors, and significance is evaluated by comparing to a background distribution of scrambled ligands and receptors.\niTALK is an R toolkit for characterizing and illustrating intercellular communication, developed and maintained by Linghua Wang Lab at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. iTALK can be used to visualize the complexity, diversity and dynamics of cell-cell communication in a wide range of biological processes.\nReference(s):\niTALK: an R Package to Characterize and Illustrate Intercellular Communication\nRecent development of high throughput single-cell sequencing technologies has made it cost-effective to profile thousands of cells from a complex sample. Examining ligand and receptor expression patterns in the cell types identified from these datasets allows prediction of cell-to-cell communication at the level of niches, tissues and organism-wide. Here, we developed NATMI (Network Analysis Toolkit for Multicellular Interactions), a Python-based toolkit for multi-cellular communication network construction and network analysis of multispecies single-cell and bulk gene expression and proteomic data. NATMI uses connectomeDB2020 (the most up-to-date manually curated ligand-receptor interaction list) and user supplied gene expression tables with cell type labels to predict and visualize cell-to-cell communication networks. By interrogating the Tabula Muris cell atlas we demonstrate the utility of NATMI to identify cellular communities and the key ligands and receptors involved. Notably, we confirm our previous predictions from bulk data that autocrine signalling is a major feature of cell-to-cell communication networks and for the first time ever show a substantial potential for self-signalling of individual cells through hundreds of co-expressed ligand-receptor pairs. Lastly, we identify age related changes in intercellular communication between the mammary gland of 3 and 18-month-old mice in the Tabula Muris dataset. NATMI and our updated ligand-receptor lists are freely available to the research community. Fast, flexible and easy-to-use command-line tool to construct cell-to-cell communication networks from user-supplied multi-omics data (single-cell and bulk) in a variety of species. Python-based (software requirements), but no additional coding in python is required. After the analysis is finished, results can be viewed directly or imported to other software of choice such as, for example, R or excel.

Such molecules can be used as potential novel biomarkers for ATLL prognosis or targets for therapy.

In this study, we determined how epsins enhance endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) in atherosclerosis and assessed the efficacy of a therapeutic peptide in a preclinical model of this disease.\nMethods: Using single-cell RNA sequencing combined with molecular, cellular, and biochemical analyses, we investigated the role of epsins in stimulating EndoMT using knockout in Apoe-/- and lineage tracing/proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 serine protease mutant viral-induced atherosclerotic mouse models. The therapeutic efficacy of a synthetic peptide targeting atherosclerotic plaques was then assessed in Apoe-/- mice.\nResults: Single-cell RNA sequencing and lineage tracing revealed that epsins 1 and 2 promote EndoMT and that the loss of endothelial epsins inhibits EndoMT marker expression and transforming growth factor-β signaling in vitro and in atherosclerotic mice, which is associated with smaller lesions in the Apoe-/- mouse model. Mechanistically, the loss of endothelial cell epsins results in increased fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 expression, which inhibits transforming growth factor-β signaling and EndoMT. Epsins directly bind ubiquitinated fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 through their ubiquitin-interacting motif, which results in endocytosis and degradation of this receptor complex. Consequently, administration of a synthetic ubiquitin-interacting motif-containing peptide atheroma ubiquitin-interacting motif peptide inhibitor significantly attenuates EndoMT and progression of atherosclerosis.\nConclusions: We conclude that epsins potentiate EndoMT during atherogenesis by increasing transforming growth factor-β signaling through fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 internalization and degradation.

Diabetes can trigger neutrophils to undergo histone citrullination by protein arginine deiminase 4 (encoded by Padi4 in mice) and release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The specific mechanism of NETs-mediated wound healing impairment in diabetes remains unknown. In this study, we show neutrophils are more susceptible to NETosis in diabetic wound environments. Via in vitro experiments and in vivo models of wound healing using wide-type and Padi4 -/- mice, we demonstrate NETs can induce the activation of PAK2 via the membrane receptor TLR-9. Then PAK2 phosphorylates the intracellular protein Merlin/NF2 to inhibit the Hippo-YAP pathway. YAP binds to transcription factor SMAD2 and translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to promote endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which ultimately impedes angiogenesis and delays wound healing. Suppression of the Merlin/YAP/SMAD2 pathway can attenuate NET-induced EndMT. Inhibition of NETosis accelerates wound healing by reducing EndMT and promoting angiogenesis. Cumulatively, these data suggest NETosis delays diabetic wound healing by inducing EndMT via the Hippo-YAP pathway.

In OA, hypertrophic chondrocytes contribute to the destruction and focal calcification of the joint cartilage. Although studies in this field have remarkably developed the modulation of joint inflammation using gene therapy and regeneration of damaged articular cartilage using cell therapy, studies that can modulate or prevent hypertrophic changes in articular chondrocytes are still lacking.\nMethods: In vitro hypertrophic differentiation and inflammation assays were conducted using human normal chondrocyte cell lines, TC28a2 cells. Human cartilage tissues and primary articular chondrocytes were obtained from OA patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), LINC02035 and LOC100130207, were selected through RNA-sequencing analysis using RNAs extracted from TC28a2 cells cultured in hypertrophic medium. The regulatory mechanism was evaluated using western blotting, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, osteocalcin reporter assay, RNA-immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP), RNA-in situ hybridization, and IP.\nResults: LncRNAs are crucial regulators of various biological processes. In this study, we identified two important lncRNAs, LINC02035 and LOC100130207, which play important roles in hypertrophic changes in normal chondrocytes, through RNA sequencing. Interestingly, the expression level of RUNX2, a master regulator of chondrocyte hypertrophy, was regulated at the post-translational level during hypertrophic differentiation of the normal human chondrocyte cell line, TC28a2. RNA-immunoprecipitation proved the potential interaction between RUNX2 protein and both lncRNAs. Knockdown (KD) of LINC02035 or LOC100130207 promoted ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of RUNX2 and prevented hypertrophic differentiation of normal chondrocyte cell lines, whereas overexpression of both lncRNAs stabilized RUNX2 protein and generated hypertrophic changes. Furthermore, the KD of the two lncRNAs mitigated the destruction of important cartilage matrix proteins, COL2A1 and ACAN, by hypertrophic differentiation or inflammatory conditions. We also confirmed that the phenotypic changes raised by the two lncRNAs could be rescued by modulating RUNX2 expression. In addition, the KD of these two lncRNAs suppressed hypertrophic changes during chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.\nConclusion: Therefore, this study suggests that LINC02035 and LOC100130207 contribute to hypertrophic changes in normal chondrocytes by regulating RUNX2, suggesting that these two novel lncRNAs could be potential therapeutic targets for delaying or preventing OA development, especially for preventing chondrocyte hypertrophy.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"9321519f03ee37463286f1f45924ee59","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36594090/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36594090/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Chondrocyte hypertrophy has been implicated in endochondral ossification and osteoarthritis (OA).

Our in vitro experiments confirmed that SIRT6 inhibited macrophage efferocytosis by restraining miR-216a-5p-216b-5p-217 cluster maturation through ‘’non-canonical’’ microprocessor complex (RNA pulldown, RIP, immunostaining, CHIP, Luciferase assays, and FISH). Moreover, we constructed m6SKO mice that underwent LIP-induced periodontitis to explore the in vitro and in vivo effect of SIRT6 on macrophage efferocytosis. Finally, antagomiR-217, a miRNA antagonism, was delivered into the periodontium to treat LIP-induced diabetic periodontitis.\nResults: We discovered that insufficient SIRT6 as a histone deacetylase in macrophages led to unresolved inflammation and aggravated periodontitis in both human and mouse DP with accumulated apoptotic neutrophil (AN) and higher generation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Mechanistically, we validated that macrophage underwent high glucose stimulation resulting in disturbance of the SIRT6-miR-216/217 axis that triggered impeded efferocytosis of AN through targeting the DEL-1/CD36 axis directly. Furthermore, we demonstrated the inhibitory role of SIRT6 for MIR217HG transcription and identified a non-canonical action of microprocessor that SIRT6 epigenetically hindered the splicing of the primary miR-216/217 via the complex of hnRNPA2B1, DGCR8, and Drosha. Notably, by constructing myeloid-specific deletion of SIRT6 mice and locally delivering antagomir-217 in DP models, we strengthened the in vivo effect of this axis in regulating macrophage efferocytosis and inflammation resolution in DP.\nConclusions: Our findings delineated the emerging role of SIRT6 in mediating metabolic dysfunction-associated inflammation, and therapeutically targeting this regulatory axis might be a promising strategy for treating diabetes-associated inflammatory diseases.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"962ac62d405e2713176dba35a981f0a8","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36593966/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36593966/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nRationale: Diabetes exacerbates the prevalence and severity of periodontitis, leading to severe periodontal destruction and ultimately tooth loss.

We revealed that NP-mediated mitophagy leads to the degradation of the mitochondria-anchored protein MAVS, thereby blocking MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling and promoting virus replication. The NP-mediated mitophagy is dependent on the interaction of NP with MAVS and the cargo receptor TOLLIP. Moreover, Y313 of NP is a key residue for the MAVS-NP interaction and NP-mediated mitophagy.

This study aims to explore the mechanism by which ASPP1 modulates p53 nuclear trafficking and the subsequent contribution to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\nThe immunofluorescent staining showed that under normal condition ASPP1 and p53 colocalized in the cytoplasm of neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes, while they were both upregulated and translocated to the nuclei upon hypoxia/reoxygenation treatment. The nuclear translocation of ASPP1 and p53 was interdependent, as knockdown of either ASPP1 or p53 attenuated nuclear translocation of the other one. Inhibition of importin-β1 resulted in the cytoplasmic sequestration of both p53 and ASPP1 in neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes with hypoxia/reoxygenation stimulation. Overexpression of ASPP1 potentiated, whereas knockdown of ASPP1 inhibited the expression of Bax (Bcl2-associated X), PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis), and Noxa, direct apoptosis-associated targets of p53. ASPP1 was also increased in the I/R myocardium. Cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic overexpression of ASPP1 aggravated I/R injury as indicated by increased infarct size and impaired cardiac function. Conversely, knockout of ASPP1 mitigated cardiac I/R injury. The same qualitative data were observed in neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation injury.

Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. reduce inflammation in the lung by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Abstract\nAcute lung injury (ALI) is a common respiratory disease in clinics, which is characterized by alveolar-capillary membrane loss, plasma protein leakage, pulmonary edema, massive neutrophil infiltration, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators. Rhodiola rosea L. an adaptogenic plant rich in phenylethanoloids, phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. We hope to verify the relieving effect of total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. (RTG) on ALI in mice and clarify its mechanism through this study. In this study, we identified the effect and mechanism of RTG on ALI through LPS-induced ALI mice. After RTG treatment, the pathological structure of lung tissue in ALI mice induced by LPS was significantly improved, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells was reduced. In addition, RTG reduced the production of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the serum of ALI mice and reduced the content or activity of MPO, T-SOD, GSH, and MDA in lung tissue. RNAseq analysis showed that RTG ameliorated LPS-induced ALI through anti-inflammatory, reduced immune response, and anti-apoptotic activities. The western blotting analysis confirmed that RTG could down-regulate the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB p65, and p-IκBα/IκBα.

However, it is unclear whether SOST can be used as a therapeutic target for bone metastases of breast cancer, and whether small molecule compounds that target SOST in breast cancer cells can inhibit breast cancer bone metastasis.\nMethods: SOST expression in 442 breast cancer tissues was characterized by immunohistochemistry and statistically analyzed for the association with breast cancer bone metastases. Bone metastatic breast cancer SCP2 cells were induced for SOST silencing or overexpression and their bone metastatic behaviors were tested in vitro and in vivo. To identify potential therapeutics, we screened inhibitors of the interaction of SOST with STAT3 from a small chemical molecule library and tested the inhibitory effects of one inhibitor on breast cancer growth and bone metastasis in vitro and in vivo.\nResults: We found that up-regulated SOST expression was associated with breast cancer bone metastases and worse survival of breast cancer patients. SOST silencing significantly reduced the bone metastatic capacity of SCP2 cells. SOST interacted with STAT3 to enhance the TGF-β/KRAS signaling, increasing both tumor growth and bone metastasis.

Here, using Drosophila melanogaster garland nephrocytes and cultured human podocytes, we aimed to elucidate the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of KEOPS related glomerular disease and to test pharmacological inhibition of ER stress related signaling as a therapeutic principle. We found that ATF4, an ER stress mediating transcription factor, or its fly orthologue Crc, were upregulated in both fly nephrocytes and human podocytes. Knockdown of Tcs3, a fly orthologue of OSGEP, caused slit diaphragm defects, recapitulating the human kidney phenotype. OSGEP cDNA with mutations found in patients lacked the capacity for rescue. Genetic interaction studies in Tcs3 deficient nephrocytes revealed that Crc mediates not only cell injury, but surprisingly also slit diaphragm defects, and that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Crc activation attenuates both phenotypes. These findings are conserved in human podocytes where ATF4 inhibition improved the viability of podocytes with OSGEP knockdown, with chemically-induced ER stress, and where ATF4 target genes and pro-apoptotic gene clusters are upregulated upon OSGEP knockdown. Thus, our data identify ATF4 mediated signaling as a molecular link between ER stress, slit diaphragm defects, podocyte injury, and suggest that modulation of ATF4 signaling may be a potential therapeutic target for certain podocyte diseases.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1672272000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672272000,"objectID":"f429b9f45447bc04c5ef72a7c2b88ba8","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36587794/","publishdate":"2022-12-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36587794/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nMutations in OSGEP and four other genes that encode subunits of the KEOPS complex cause Galloway-Mowat syndrome, a severe, inherited kidney-neurological disease.

However, the mechanism of PD-L1 in pulmonary fibrosis is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated upregulated expression of PD-L1 in fibrotic lung tissues and sera of IPF patients. Bleomycin (BLM) treatment induced PD-L1 upregulation, EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition) and fibrosis-like morphology changes in human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiCs).

Finally, we used BLM- and paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis animal models to confirm the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects of PD-L1 silencing.

LUCAT1 regulates splicing and stability of NR4A2 which contributes to the inhibitory effect of LUCAT1 on interferons and inflammatory cytokines. Finally, data from COPD and IBD patients indicate that LUCAT1 levels are elevated in these patient groups where expression is positively correlated with disease severity. Thus, LUCAT1 may serve as a diagnostic marker for inflammation and as a therapeutic target in the future.\nAbstract\nThe nuclear long non-coding RNA LUCAT1 has previously been identified as a negative feedback regulator of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine expression in human myeloid cells. Here, we define the mechanistic basis for the suppression of inflammatory gene expression by LUCAT1. Using comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry as well as RNA immunoprecipitation, we identified proteins important in processing and alternative splicing of mRNAs as LUCAT1-binding proteins. These included heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C, M, and A2B1. Consistent with this finding, cells lacking LUCAT1 have altered splicing of selected immune genes. In particular, upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation, the splicing of the nuclear receptor 4A2 (NR4A2) gene was particularly affected. As a consequence, expression of NR4A2 was reduced and delayed in cells lacking LUCAT1. NR4A2-deficient cells had elevated expression of immune genes. These observations suggest that LUCAT1 is induced to control the splicing and stability of NR4A2, which is in part responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of LUCAT1. Furthermore, we analyzed a large cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease as well as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In these patients, LUCAT1 levels were elevated and in both diseases, positively correlated with disease severity. Collectively, these studies define a key molecular mechanism of LUCAT1-dependent immune regulation through post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs highlighting its role in the regulation of inflammatory disease.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1672185600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672185600,"objectID":"0151d6c2ca51e7d00874eed48c3c8e23","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36577072/","publishdate":"2022-12-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36577072/","section":"article","summary":"Significance\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abundant in the human genome, yet, in contrast to proteins, only a small portion of lncRNAs have been functionally characterized.

Excluding adjuvant therapy, there are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AKI. Using an adipic dihydride linker, we modified the hyaluronic acid polymer chain with a potent antioxidant, bilirubin, to produce an amphiphilic conjugate. Subsequently, we developed a kidney-targeted and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive drug delivery system based on the flash nanocomplexation method to deliver a well-known intracellular calcium chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM, BA), with the goal of rescuing renal cell damage via rapidly scavenging of intracellularly overloaded Ca2+.

The protective effect disappeared following reconstitution of AMs in injured IL-33 knockdown mice, and the differentiation of lung epithelium was blocked again. In conclusion, the IL-33-ST2 pathway regulates AECII transdifferentiation by targeting AMs proliferation and polarization in BPD, which shows a novel strategy for manipulating the IL-33-ST2-AMs axis for the diagnosis and intervention of BPD.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1672099200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672099200,"objectID":"6167ea660c7ec599e1365c5a7507723d","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36573439/","publishdate":"2022-12-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36573439/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nEvidence points to the indispensable function of alveolar macrophages (AMs) in normal lung development and tissue homeostasis.

Technologies that can overcome these barriers are still lacking, which hurdles the clinical potential of orally delivered siRNA. Herein, small-sized, fluorinated nanocapsules (F-NCs) were developed to mediate efficient oral delivery of TNF-α siRNA for anti-inflammation treatment. The NCs possessed a disulfide-cross-linked shell structure, thus featuring robust stability in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of their small size (∼30 nm) and fluorocarbon-assisted repelling of mucin adsorption, the best-performing F3-NCs showed excellent mucus penetration and intestinal transport capabilities without impairing the intestinal tight junction, conferring the oral bioavailability of 20.4% in relative to i.v. injection. The disulfide cross-linker could be cleaved inside target cells, causing NCs dissociation and siRNA release to potentiate the TNF-α silencing efficiency. In murine models of acute and chronic inflammation, orally delivered F3-NCs provoked efficient TNF-α silencing and pronounced anti-inflammatory efficacies. This study therefore provides a transformative strategy for oral siRNA delivery, and would render promising utilities for anti-inflammation treatment. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the lipid remodeling mechanism that determines sensitivity to ferroptosis remains poorly understood. Here, we report a previously unrecognized role for the lipid flippase solute carrier family 47 member 1 (SLC47A1) as a regulator of lipid remodeling and survival during ferroptosis. Among 49 phospholipid scramblases, flippases, and floppases we analyzed, only SLC47A1 had mRNA that was selectively upregulated in multiple cancer cells exposed to ferroptotic inducers. Large-scale lipidomics and functional analyses revealed that the silencing of SLC47A1 increased RSL3- or erastin-induced ferroptosis by favoring ACSL4-SOAT1-mediated production of polyunsaturated fatty acid cholesterol esters. We identified peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARA) as a transcription factor that transactivates SLC47A1. The depletion of PPARA and SLC47A1 similarly sensitized cells to ferroptosis induction, whereas transfection-enforced re-expression of SLC47A1 restored resistance to ferroptosis in PPARA-deficient cells. Pharmacological or genetic blockade of the PPARA-SLC47A1 pathway increased the anticancer activity of a ferroptosis inducer in mice.

The majority of computational approaches construct a homologous network using multi-source data, but they lose the heterogeneity of the data. Effective methods that use the features of multi-source data are considered as a matter of urgency. In this paper, we propose a model (CDHGNN) based on edge-weighted graph attention and heterogeneous graph neural networks for potential circRNA-disease association prediction. The circRNA network, micro RNA network, disease network and heterogeneous network are constructed based on multi-source data. To reflect association probabilities between nodes, an edge-weighted graph attention network model is designed for node features. To assign attention weights to different types of edges and learn contextual meta-path, CDHGNN infers potential circRNA-disease association based on heterogeneous neural networks. CDHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy. Edge-weighted graph attention networks and heterogeneous graph networks have both improved performance significantly.

Clinically, circPDIA4 was significantly upregulated in malignant tissues and associated with poor survival of gastric cancer patients. The biogenesis of circPDIA4 was mediated by the RNA binding protein Quaking, which bound intron 2 and 4 of PDIA4 pre-mRNA to promote backsplicing of exons 3 and 4. Elevated expression of circPDIA4 promoted distant metastasis in various mouse xenograft models in vivo and accelerated cancer cell invasion in vitro. CircPDIA4 functioned through distinct oncogenic mechanisms in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Cytoplasmic circPDIA4 bound to ERK1/2 and sustained hyper-activation of the MAPK pathway by preventing DUSP6-mediated ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. Notably, circPDIA4 depletion enhanced the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to ERK inhibitors. In the nucleus, circPDIA4 interacted with DHX9 as a decoy and repressed its inhibitory functions on circRNA biogenesis to boost expression of multiple oncogenic circRNAs, which promoted gastric cancer progression.

Herein, we revealed that methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), the major methyltransferase of m6A methylation, was downregulated during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and neointima formation. Knockdown of METTL3 facilitated, while overexpression of METTL3 suppressed the proliferation of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) by arresting HASMCs at G2/M checkpoint and the phosphorylation of CDC2 (p-CDC2) was inactivated by METTL3. On the other hand, the migration and synthetic phenotype of HASMCs were enhanced by METTL3 knockdown, but inhibited by METTL3 overexpression. The protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP7 and MMP9 were reduced, while the expression level of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 was increased in HASMCs with METTL3 overexpression. Moreover, METTL3 promoted the autophagosome formation by upregulating the expression of ATG5 (autophagy-related 5) and ATG7. Knockdown of either ATG5 or ATG7 largely reversed the regulatory effects of METTL3 overexpression on phenotypic switching of HASMCs, as evidenced by increased proliferation and migration, and predisposed to synthetic phenotype. These results indicate that METTL3 inhibits the phenotypic switching of VSMCs by positively regulating ATG5-mediated and ATG7-mediated autophagosome formation.

A second ligand pocket was recently discovered in the transmembrane domain for a synthetic agonist. On its downstream outputs, accumulating studies sketch primordial and multifaceted roles of STING beyond its cytokine-inducing function, such as autophagy, cell death, metabolic modulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and RNA virus restriction. Furthermore, with the expansion of the STING interactome, the details of STING trafficking also get clearer. After retrospecting the brief history of viral interference and the milestone events since the discovery of STING, we present a vivid panorama of STING biology taking into account the details of the biochemical assay and structural information, especially its versatile outputs and functions beyond IFN induction.

We recently identified a similar multimeric complex downstream of TLR4, termed the TRIFosome, that regulates inflammation and cell death in response to LPS or Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. We present evidence of a role for the TRIFosome downstream of TNF-R1, independent of TLR3 or TLR4 engagement. Specifically, TNF-induced cell death and inflammation in murine macrophages were driven by the TLR4 adaptor TRIF and the LPS co-receptor CD14, highlighting an important role for these proteins beyond TLR-mediated immune responses. Via immunoprecipitation and visualization of TRIF-specific puncta, we demonstrated TRIF- and CD14-dependent formation of prodeath and proinflammatory complexes in response to TNF. Extending these findings, in a murine TNF-induced sepsis model, TRIF and CD14 deficiency decreased systemic inflammation, reduced organ pathology, and improved survival. The outcome of TRIF activation was cell specific, because TNF-induced lethality was mediated by neutrophils and macrophages responding to TNF in a TRIF-dependent manner.

Arterial ligation or wire injury was used to induce neointima in mice, whereas ApoE-/- and LDLR-/- (low-density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR) mice fed a high-fat diet were applied to assess atherosclerosis. In addition, coronary stent implantation was performed on vaccine-immunized Bama miniature pigs, followed by optical coherence tomography to evaluate coronary intimal hyperplasia.\nResults: A vaccine, ATS7vac, was screened out from 3 candidates to effectively inhibit intimal thickening in murine carotid artery ligation models after vaccination. As well, immunization with ATS7vac alleviated neointima formation in murine wire injury models and mitigated atherosclerotic lesions in both hyperlipidemic ApoE-/- and LDLR-/- mice without lowering lipid levels. Preclinically, ATS7vac markedly impeded intimal hyperplasia in swine stented coronary arteries, but without significant immune-related organ injuries. Mechanistically, ATS7vac vaccination produced specific antibodies against ADAMTS-7, which markedly repressed ADAMTS-7-mediated COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein) and TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) degradation and subsequently inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell migration but promoted re-endothelialization.\nConclusions: ATS7vac is a novel atherosclerosis vaccine that also alleviates in-stent restenosis.

Hibiscus sabdariffa leaf extracts (HLE), rich in polyphenol, have been shown to possess hypoglycemic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, antiatherosclerotic, and anticancer effects. The aim of the study is to examine the inhibitory effect of HLE and its main component ellagic acid (EA) on renal fibrosis. In vitro, mouse renal glomerular mesangial SV40MES13 cells pretreated with UA were demonstrated to trigger obvious morphological changes and viability loss, as well as affect matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activities. Noncytotoxic doses of HLE and EA abolished the UA-induced cell injury and MMP-2/9 secretion. In addition, HLE and EA exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on the UA-treated cells with a reduction in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) production. Next, the UA-activated pro-fibrotic factors, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) were inhibited by HLE or EA. Mechanistic assays indicated that antifibrotic effects of HLE might be mediated via TGF-β/Smad signaling, as confirmed by the transfection of Smad7 siRNA. In vivo, HLE and EA supplementations significantly alleviated HN development, which may result from inhibiting adenine-induced TGF-β production accompanying oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as fibrogenesis.

Mechanistically, SCNN1B did not affect KRAS activation, instead impairing activation of c-Raf by inducing its inhibitory phosphorylation and targeting active c-Raf for degradation. The ectopic expression of c-Raf fully rescued cell proliferation and colony formation in SCNN1B-overexpressing CRC cells, confirming c-Raf as the principal molecular target of SCNN1B.

Here, we designed a strategy to boost efferocytosis, denoted “chimeric receptor for efferocytosis” (CHEF). We fused a specific signaling domain within the cytoplasmic adapter protein ELMO1 to the extracellular phosphatidylserine recognition domains of the efferocytic receptors BAI1 or TIM4, generating BELMO and TELMO, respectively. CHEF-expressing phagocytes display a striking increase in efferocytosis. In mouse models of inflammation, BELMO expression attenuates colitis, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. In mechanistic studies, BELMO increases ER-resident enzymes and chaperones to overcome protein-folding-associated toxicity, which was further validated in a model of ER-stress-induced renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Here we show that in sex-separated Caenorhabditis elegans strains, paternal, but not maternal, exposure to ionizing radiation leads to transgenerational embryonic lethality. The offspring of irradiated males displayed various genome instability phenotypes, including DNA fragmentation, chromosomal rearrangement and aneuploidy. Paternal DNA double strand breaks were repaired by maternally provided error-prone polymerase theta-mediated end joining. Mechanistically, we show that depletion of an orthologue of human histone H1.0, HIS-24, or the heterochromatin protein HPL-1, could significantly reverse the transgenerational embryonic lethality. Removal of HIS-24 or HPL-1 reduced histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation and enabled error-free homologous recombination repair in the germline of the F1 generation from ionizing radiation-treated P0 males, consequently improving the viability of the F2 generation.

Here, we find that macrophages display enhanced efferocytosis under prolonged (chronic) physiological hypoxia, characterized by increased internalization and accelerated degradation of ACs. Transcriptional and translational analyses revealed that chronic physiological hypoxia induces two distinct but complimentary states. The first, “primed” state, consists of concomitant transcription and translation of metabolic programs in AC-naive macrophages that persist during efferocytosis. The second, “poised” state, consists of transcription, but not translation, of phagocyte function programs in AC-naive macrophages that are translated during efferocytosis. Mechanistically, macrophages efficiently flux glucose into a noncanonical pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) loop to enhance NADPH production. PPP-derived NADPH directly supports enhanced efferocytosis under physiological hypoxia by ensuring phagolysosomal maturation and redox homeostasis. Thus, macrophages residing under physiological hypoxia adopt states that support cell fitness and ensure performance of essential homeostatic functions rapidly and safely.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1671580800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671580800,"objectID":"c5bba7f25230896653e2eb91d3bf8201","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36584675/","publishdate":"2022-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36584675/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nChronic physiological hypoxia enhances macrophage apoptotic cell uptake and degradation Chronic physiological hypoxia induces both primed and poised states in macrophages Both primed and poised state programs directly support enhanced continual efferocytosis A noncanonical PPP loop supports enhanced efferocytosis and maintains redox homeostasis Abstract","tags":["Metabolism","Efferocytosis","Cell Death"],"title":"Metabolic adaptation supports enhanced macrophage efferocytosis in limited-oxygen environments","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nPathological effects of apoptosis associated with viral infections of the central nervous system are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Reovirus is a neurotropic virus that causes apoptosis in neurons, leading to lethal encephalitis in newborn mice. Reovirus-induced encephalitis is diminished in mice with germ line ablation of NF-κB subunit p50. It is not known whether the proapoptotic function of NF-κB is mediated by neural-cell-intrinsic (neural-intrinsic) processes, NF-κB-regulated cytokine production by inflammatory cells, or a combination of both. To determine the contribution of cell type-specific NF-κB signaling in reovirus-induced neuronal injury, we established mice that lack NF-κB p65 expression in neural cells using the Cre/loxP recombination system. Following intracranial inoculation of reovirus, 50% of wild-type (WT) mice succumbed to infection, whereas more than 90% of mice lacking neural cell NF-κB p65 (Nsp65-/-) survived. While viral loads in brains of WT and Nsp65-/- mice were comparable, histological analysis revealed that reovirus antigen-positive areas in the brains of WT mice displayed increased immunoreactivity for cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, relative to Nsp65-/- mice. These data suggest that neural-intrinsic NF-κB-dependent factors are essential mediators of reovirus neurovirulence. RNA sequencing analysis of reovirus-infected brain cortices of WT and Nsp65-/- mice suggests that NF-κB activation in neuronal cells upregulates genes involved in innate immunity, inflammation, and cell death following reovirus infection. A better understanding of the contribution of cell type-specific NF-κB-dependent signaling to viral neuropathogenesis could inform development of new therapeutics that target and protect highly vulnerable cell populations.\nImportance\nViral encephalitis contributes to illness and death in children and adults worldwide and has limited treatment options. Identifying common host factors upregulated by neurotropic viruses can enhance an understanding of virus-induced neuropathogenesis and aid in development of therapeutics. Although many neurotropic viruses activate NF-κB during infection, mechanisms by which NF-κB regulates viral neuropathogenesis and contributes to viral encephalitis are not well understood. We established mice in which NF-κB expression is ablated in neural tissue to study the function of NF-κB in reovirus neurovirulence and identify genes activated by NF-κB in response to reovirus infection in the central nervous system. Encephalitis following reovirus infection was dampened in mice lacking neural cell NF-κB. Reovirus induced a chemokine profile in the brain that was dependent on NF-κB signaling and was similar to chemokine profiles elicited by other neurotropic viruses. These data suggest common underlying mechanisms of encephalitis caused by neurotropic viruses and potentially shared therapeutic targets.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1671580800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671580800,"objectID":"918af25699337716a0c86545adbf7243","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36541803/","publishdate":"2022-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36541803/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nPathological effects of apoptosis associated with viral infections of the central nervous system are an important cause of morbidity and mortality.

Although animal and human autopsy studies have suggested mechanisms driving acute anosmia, it remains unclear how SARS-CoV-2 causes persistent smell loss in a subset of patients. To address this question, we analyzed olfactory epithelial samples collected from 24 biopsies, including from nine patients with objectively quantified long-term smell loss after COVID-19. This biopsy-based approach revealed a diffuse infiltrate of T cells expressing interferon-γ and a shift in myeloid cell population composition, including enrichment of CD207+ dendritic cells and depletion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Despite the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA or protein, gene expression in the barrier supporting cells of the olfactory epithelium, termed sustentacular cells, appeared to reflect a response to ongoing inflammatory signaling, which was accompanied by a reduction in the number of olfactory sensory neurons relative to olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells.

When nuclear R-loops were perturbed by depleting the RNA–DNA helicase senataxin (SETX) or the breast cancer gene BRCA1, we observed XPG- and XPF-dependent cytoplasmic hybrid formation.

Cytoplasmic hybrids bind to the pattern recognition receptors cGAS and TLR3, activating IRF3 and inducing apoptosis. Excised hybrids and an R-loop-induced innate immune response were also observed in SETX-mutated cells from patients with ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 and in BRCA1-mutated cancer cells. These findings establish RNA–DNA hybrids as immunogenic species that aberrantly accumulate in the cytoplasm after R-loop processing, linking R-loop accumulation to cell death through the innate immune response.

Deeper transcriptome, chromatin and pathway analyses revealed conservation of cell identity traits as well as two universal senescence hallmarks (inflammation and fibrosis) across cell type, regeneration time and ageing.

By contrast, transplantation of senescent cells delays regeneration. Our results provide a technique for isolating in vivo senescent cells, define a senescence blueprint for muscle, and uncover unproductive functional interactions between senescent cells and stem cells in regenerative niches that can be overcome.

Upstream regulator analysis of murine nephrotoxic AKI transcriptomics identified AP-1 as highly upregulated. Among AP-1 canonical components, Fosl1 was found to be upregulated in two transcriptomics datasets from nephrotoxic murine AKI induced by folic acid or cisplatin and from proximal tubular cells exposed to TWEAK, a cytokine mediator of AKI. Fosl1 was minimally expressed in the kidneys of control uninjured mice. Increased Fosl1 protein was localized to proximal tubular cell nuclei in AKI. In human AKI, FOSL1 was found present in proximal tubular cells in kidney sections and in urine along with increased urinary FOSL1 mRNA. Selective Fosl1 deficiency in proximal tubular cells (Fosl1Δtub) increased the severity of murine cisplatin- or folate-induced AKI as characterized by lower kidney function, more severe kidney inflammation and Klotho downregulation. Indeed, elevated AP-1 activity was observed after cisplatin-induced AKI in Fosl1Δtub mice compared to wild type mice. More severe Klotho downregulation preceded more severe kidney dysfunction. The Klotho promoter was enriched in Fosl1 binding sites and Fosl1 bound to the Klotho promoter in cisplatin-AKI. In cultured proximal tubular cells, Fosl1 targeting increased the proinflammatory response and downregulated Klotho. In vivo, recombinant Klotho administration protected Fosl1Δtub mice from cisplatin-AKI.

Ufmylation is involved in processes such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation, ribosome-associated protein quality control at the ER and ER-phagy. However, it remains unclear how ufmylation regulates such distinct ER-related functions. Here we identify a UFM1 substrate, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3), that localizes on the ER membrane.

Here, we show chronic exposure of AR at a dose found in commonly consumed dietary products exacerbates experimental models of colitis in mice. While intermittent exposure is more akin to a typical human exposure, intermittent exposure to AR in mice for 12 weeks, does not influence susceptibility to colitis. However, exposure to AR during early life primes mice to heightened susceptibility to colitis. In addition, chronic exposure to AR induces mild colitis, which is associated with elevated colonic serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) levels and impairment of the epithelial barrier function via myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Importantly, chronic exposure to AR does not influence colitis susceptibility in mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), the rate limiting enzyme for 5-HT biosynthesis. Cecal transfer of the perturbed gut microbiota by AR exposure worsens colitis severity in the recipient germ-free (GF) mice. Furthermore, chronic AR exposure elevates colonic 5-HT levels in naïve GF mice.

Potassium effects on blood pressure have been described previously; however, whether or not low K+ independently affects kidney disease progression remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that dietary K+ deficiency causes direct kidney injury. Effects depend on reduced blood K+ and are kidney specific. In response to reduced K+, the channel Kir4.2 mediates altered proximal tubule (PT) basolateral K+ flux, causing intracellular acidosis and activation of the enzyme glutaminase and the ammoniagenesis pathway. Deletion of either Kir4.2 or glutaminase protects from low-K+ injury. Reduced K+also mediates injury and fibrosis in a model of aldosteronism. These results demonstrate that the PT epithelium, like the distal nephron, is K+ sensitive, with reduced blood K+ causing direct PT injury.

The present study revealed that secondary Staphylococcus aureus infection significantly aggravated the activation of mast cells during the initial H1N1 infection both in vivo and in vitro, which was closely related to the increased inflammatory lung injury and mortality. Meanwhile, the secondary S. aureus infection suppressed autophagy and promoted inflammatory mediators released by mast cells through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Here, we conducted focal colorectal distention (fCRD) to drive both visceromotor responses (VMRs) and aversion. We first found that spinal CCK neurons were necessary for noxious fCRD to drive both VMRs and aversion under naive conditions. We next showed that spinal VGLUT3 neurons mediate visceral allodynia, whose ablation caused loss of aversion evoked by low-intensity fCRD in mice with gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation or spinal circuit disinhibition. Importantly, these neurons were dispensable for driving sensitized VMRs under both inflammatory and central disinhibition conditions. Anatomically, a subset of VGLUT3 neurons projected to parabrachial nuclei, whose photoactivation sufficiently generated aversion in mice with GI inflammation, without influencing VMRs.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study describes pancreatic tissue damage and exocrine dysfunction in a mouse model of major-liver-resection-induced ALF. The analysis of 1,264 clinical cases of liver failure (LF) showed that the incidence of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia in patients with LF is 5.5% and 20%, respectively. Metabolomic studies indicate that glutathione (GSH)-deficiency-caused ferroptosis contributes to pancreatic damage in mouse ALF. β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) is the only metabolite downregulated in the liver, serum, and pancreas. Our data suggest that β-HB protects pancreatic cells and tissues from GSH-deficiency-caused ferroptosis. β-HB administration in ALF mice restores the expression of ferroptosis-suppressor genes through histone H3 lysine 9 β-hydroxybutyrylation (H3K9bhb)-mediated chromatin opening.

The susceptibility of bat organoids to a bat coronavirus CoV-HKU4, but resistance to EV-71, an enterovirus of exclusive human origin, indicated that bat organoids adequately recapitulated the authentic susceptibility of bats to certain viruses. Importantly, TLR3/RLR inhibition in bat organoids significantly boosted viral growth in the early phase after SARS-CoV-2 or CoV-HKU4 infection.

We aim to investigate the interplay mechanism of these writers in immunogenomic features and molecular biological characteristics in PC.\nMethods: We first accessed the specific expression pattern and transcriptional variation of 26 RNA modification writers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Unsupervised consensus clustering was performed to divide patients into two RNA modification clusters. Then, based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among two clusters, RNA modification score (WM-Score) model was established to determine RNA modification-based subtypes and was validated in International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) dataset. What’s more, we manifested the unique status of WM-Score in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, molecular biological characteristics, targeted therapies and immunogenomic patterns.\nResults: We documented the tight-knit correlations between transcriptional expression and variation of RNA modification writers. We classified patients into two distinct RNA modification patterns (WM-Score-high and -low), The WM-Score_high subgroup was correlated with worse prognosis, Th2/Th17 cell polarization and oncogenic pathways (e.g. EMT, TGF-β, and mTORC1 signaling pathways), whereas the WM-Score-low subgroup associated with favorable survival rate and Th1 cell trend.

Additionally, the potential targeted compounds with related pathways for the WM-Score model were further identified.\nConclusions: Our research unfolds a novel horizon on the interplay network of four RNA modifications in PC.

Different labeling strategies have been demonstrated for live-cell stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy of mitochondria, but orthogonal strategies are yet to be established, and image acquisition has suffered either from photodamage to the organelles or from rapid photobleaching. Therefore, live-cell nanoscopy of mitochondria has been largely restricted to two-dimensional (2D) single-color recordings of cancer cells. Here, by conjugation of cyclooctatetraene (COT) to a benzo-fused cyanine dye, we report a mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) fluorescent marker, PK Mito Orange (PKMO), featuring efficient STED at 775 nm, strong photostability, and markedly reduced phototoxicity. PKMO enables super-resolution (SR) recordings of IM dynamics for extended periods in immortalized mammalian cell lines, primary cells, and organoids. Photostability and reduced phototoxicity of PKMO open the door to live-cell three-dimensional (3D) STED nanoscopy of mitochondria for 3D analysis of the convoluted IM. PKMO is optically orthogonal with green and far-red markers, allowing multiplexed recordings of mitochondria using commercial STED microscopes.

Therefore, this study investigated the ameliorative effects and the underlying mechanisms of BBR on cecal ligature and puncture (CLP) rats.\nMethods: This study has observed the effect of BBR on pathological injury, Inflammation, intestinal barrier function, gut microbiota, and metabolite change in CLP rats by Hematoxylin-eosin staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, flow cytometry, 16S rDNA, and metabolomics analyses.\nResults: The inhibition effects of BBR treatment on the histological damage of the lung, kidney, and ileum, the interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-17A, and monocyte chemokine-1 levels in serum in CLP rats were proved. Also, the BBR inhibited the diamine-oxidase and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 40 levels, suggesting it can improve intestinal barrier function disorders.

Here we explored a new mode of tubulovascular crosstalk mediated by small extracellular vesicles (sEV) after AKI. In response to renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, endothelial proliferation of PTCs and tubular expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) were increased, accompanied by a remarkable redistribution of cytoplasmic VEGF-A to the basolateral side of tubular cells. Meanwhile, the secretion mode of VEGF-A was converted in the injured tubular cells, which showed a much greater tendency to secrete VEGF-A via sEV other than the free form. Interestingly, tubular cell-derived VEGF-A-enriched sEV (sEV-VEGF-A) turned out to promote endothelial proliferation which was regulated by VEGF receptors 1 and 2. Furthermore, inhibition of renal sEV secretion by Rab27a knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in the proliferation of peritubular endothelial cells in vivo.

Defects in the rewiring of metabolism in response to alterations in nutrient supply have been linked to human diseases ranging from diabetes to muscle atrophy. Starvation represses anabolic pathways and facilitates catabolic ones, such as the degradation of macromolecules by autophagy and endolysosomes. Starvation also promotes the β-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Within cells, organelles including lysosomes and mitochondria undergo changes in shape and dynamics. These processes are often regulated by phosphoinositide lipids. Phosphoinositides are also involved in the formation of membrane contacts between organelles and in the response of cells and tissues to growth and nutrient signals. How the adaptive changes that protect mammalian cells and tissues from starvation-induced damage are coordinated on a cell-wide scale is unknown.\nRATIONALE\nEndolysosomal membrane dynamics and function are controlled by phosphoinositide signaling lipids, most notably by the synthesis and turnover of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P]. Patients carrying mutations in the gene encoding the lipid phosphatase MTM1, an enzyme that mediates endosomal PI(3)P turnover, suffer from X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLCNM), a severe neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle atrophy, disorganization of mitochondria, and defects in the organization of the muscle endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Given that PI(3)P is a hallmark of endosomes, we hypothesized that the control of early endosomal PI(3)P by MTM1 might serve to orchestrate adaptive changes in the dynamics of the ER and mitochondria in response to altering nutrient supply.\nRESULTS\nWorking with XLCNM patient–derived myoblasts and engineered cell lines, we found that nutrient starvation (for example, lack of amino acids) induced the hydrolysis of PI(3)P by endosomal recruitment of MTM1. Concomitantly, tubular ER membranes were observed to be converted into ER sheets by live super-resolution light microscopy. Mechanistically, loss of early endosomal PI(3)P upon starvation was found to reduce membrane contacts between peripheral ER tubules and early endosomes. These contacts function as physical tethers that may transmit pulling forces from highly motile peripheral endosomes to the tubular ER. Using proximity labeling proteomic and functional cell biological experiments we demonstrated that the ER–endosome contacts were mediated by binding of the related ER membrane proteins RRBP1 and kinectin 1 to PI(3)P on endosomes. To study the role of starvation-induced reshaping of tubular ER membranes into sheets on mitochondrial form and function, we combined live imaging with three-dimensional focused ion beam milling scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and proteomic analysis. We found that starvation-induced ER reshaping by MTM1 reduced the rate of mitochondrial fission and promoted the formation of a hyperfused mitochondrial network. Genetic manipulations that resulted in ER sheet expansion caused the formation of an enlarged mitochondrial network even in fed cells. Conversely, impaired ER reshaping and reduced mitochondrial network formation were observed in starved myoblasts from XLCNM patients. Mitochondrial network formation appeared to be critical for the delivery of fatty acids from lipid droplets to mitochondria and for oxidative ATP production to sustain energy supply in nutrient-deprived cells.\nCONCLUSION\nOur data unravel a crucial role for early endosomal lipid signaling in controlling ER morphology and, thereby, mitochondrial form and function to orchestrate the adaptive response of cells to alterations in nutrient (e.g., amino acid) supply. This mechanism operates independent of autophagy, a cellular self-eating process typically induced by prolonged starvation. Rather, it resembles an organellar conveyor belt, in which the tubular ER serves as a membrane conduit that transmits nutrient-triggered changes in endosomal PI(3)P levels to metabolic organelles to enable metabolic rewiring. How early endosomal PI(3)P levels and MTM1 function are controlled by cellular nutrient status is currently unknown. Defects in ER shape, mitochondrial morphogenesis, and cellular ATP depletion caused by loss of MTM1 function can explain the observed myofiber hypotrophy and defective ER organization in animal models of XLCNM and in human patients who often appear undernourished. We therefore hypothesize that dysregulated organelle remodeling may underlie XLCNM caused by MTM1 mutations in humans.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1671148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671148800,"objectID":"b0ae3a54eed0e2fd4a4f95c6d7352828","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36520888/","publishdate":"2022-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36520888/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nINTRODUCTION\nCells need to react appropriately to nutritional cues.

NMNAT2 is an important molecular target affecting disease treatment. Abstract\nNicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) is an evolutionarily conserved nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthase located in the cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus. NMNAT2 has an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, malignant tumors, and other diseases that seriously endanger human health. NMNAT2 exerts a neuroprotective function through its NAD synthase activity and chaperone function. Among them, the NMNAT2-NAD+-Sterile alpha and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor motif-containing 1 (SARM1) axis is closely related to Wallerian degeneration. Physical injury or pathological stimulation will cause a decrease in NMNAT2, which activates SARM1, leading to axonal degeneration and the occurrence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease, peripheral neuropathy, and other neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, NMNAT2 exerts a cancer-promoting role in solid tumors, including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and glioma, and is closely related to tumor occurrence and development. This paper reviews the chromosomal and subcellular localization of NMNAT2 and its basic biological functions.

We have previously shown that single immunoglobin IL-1 receptor-related protein (SIGIRR), a negative regulator of IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor signalling, inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in AMs. To address the biological relevance of SIGIRR in vivo, we generated a murine ALI model via intratracheal instillation of LPS. Intriguingly, SIGIRR expression was observed to be decreased in resident and recruited macrophages during ALI. This decrease was associated with parallel induction in CD18 protein levels in LPS-challenged lung tissues. Through intranasal injection of SIGIRR lentiviral particles studies, we showed that the overexpression of SIGIRR attenuated recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils, decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and ameliorated pathological changes in lungs. Whilst exploring the basis for this phenotype, SIGIRR was found to be coexpressed with CD18 in AMs, and SIGIRR potentiated the instability of CD18 protein via enhancement of its ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Conversely, by using CD18-/- mice, we further observed that CD18 deletion completely abolished the therapeutic effects of overexpression of SIGIRR on LPS-induced ALI. Mover, overexpression of CD18 in AMs promoted adhesion to ECM components, enhanced TLR4-mediated inflammasome activation and thereby potentiated IL-1β production.

Human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons have shown great potential in different types of brain disorders in adults. However, it remains unknown whether and how grafted human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons can repair immature brains with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Here, by administrating genetically labelled human embryonic stem cell-derived striatal neural progenitors into the ipsilateral striatum of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy-injured mice, we found that the grafted cells gradually matured into GABA spiny projection neurons morphologically and electrophysiologically, and significantly rescued the area loss of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy-injured brains. Intriguingly, using immunohistochemical staining combined with enhanced ascorbate peroxidase-based immunoelectron microscopy and rabies virus-mediated trans-synaptic tracing, we show that the grafts start to extend axonal projections to the endogenous target areas (globus pallidus externa, globus pallidus internus, substantia nigra), form synapses with host striatal, globus pallidus and nigra neurons, and receive extensive and stable synaptic inputs as early as 2 months post-transplantation. Importantly, we further demonstrated functional neural circuits re-established between the grafted neurons and host cortical, striatal and substantial nigra neurons at 3-6 months post-transplantation in the hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy-injured brain by optogenetics combined with electrophysiological recording. Finally, the transplanted striatal spiny projection neurons but not spinal GABA neurons restored the motor defects of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, which were reversed by clozapine-N-oxide-based inhibition of graft function. These findings demonstrate anatomical and functional reconstruction of the basal ganglia neural circuit including multiple loops by striatal spiny projection neurons in hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy-injured immature brains, which raises the possibility of such a cell replacement therapeutic strategy for hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy in neonates.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1671062400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671062400,"objectID":"4080765082d74eb0d9a0d75a9517f08c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36516880/","publishdate":"2022-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36516880/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nPerinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy is the leading cause of neonatal death and permanent neurological deficits, while the basal ganglia is one of the major nuclei that is selectively and greatly affected in the brains of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy patients, especially in severe cases.","tags":["Tissue Injury","Nervous System","Brain"],"title":"Functional reconstruction of the basal ganglia neural circuit by human striatal neurons in hypoxic-ischaemic injured brain","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nNETosis is a key host immune process against a pathogenic infection during innate immune activation, consisting of a neutrophil “explosion” and, consequently, NET formation, containing mainly DNA, histones, and other nuclear proteins.

Here, we investigate the therapeutic potential of EVs derived from human placental mesenchymal stem cells (hP-MSCs) for the treatment of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury. Our data revealed that EVs derived from hP-MSCs effectively ameliorate liver injury by attenuating inflammation and fibrosis. Further data revealed that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the surface of HSCs mediate the internalization of EVs. Furthermore, EVs could inhibit the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in HSCs through the downregulated TGF-/Smad pathway, which was mediated by miR-744-5p in EVs. Meanwhile, glycosaminoglycans on the surface of EVs play a crucial anti-inflammatory role.

Whether and how ICB therapy manipulates antibody-mediated immune response in cancer environments, however, remains elusive. Using tandem mass spectrometric analysis of modification of immunoglobulin G (IgG) from hepatoma tissues, we identified a role of ICB therapy in catalyzing IgG sialylation in the Fc region. Effector T cells triggered sialylation of IgG via an interferon (IFN)-γ-ST6Gal-I-dependent pathway. DC-SIGN+ macrophages represented the main target cells of sialylated IgG. Upon interacting with sialylated IgG, DC-SIGN stimulated Raf-1-elicited elevation of ATF3, which inactivated cGAS-STING pathway and eliminated subsequent type-I-IFN-triggered antitumorigenic immunity. Although enhanced IgG sialylation in tumors predicted improved therapeutic outcomes for patients receiving ICB therapy, impeding IgG sialylation augmented antitumorigenic T cell immunity after ICB therapy.

Here, STAT3 signaling is hyperactivated in macrophages in the context of both non-sterile and sterile inflammatory osteolysis, and this was highly correlated with the cleaved interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression pattern. Strikingly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 markedly blocks macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro, thereby relieving inflammatory macrophage-amplified osteoclast formation and bone resorptive activity. Mechanistically, STAT3 inhibition in macrophages triggers PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)-dependent mitophagy that eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria, reverses mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, and inhibits mitochondrial reactive oxygen species release, thus inactivating the NLRP3 inflammasome. In vivo, STAT3 inhibition effectively protects mice from both infection-induced periapical lesions and aseptic titanium particle-mediated calvarial bone erosion with potent induction of PINK1 and downregulation of inflammasome activation, macrophage infiltration, and osteoclast formation.

DNA lesion-stalled RNA polymerase (Pol) II triggers the transcription-coupled DNA repair pathway, which involves multiple regulatory factors acting in a concerted and sequential manner. Transcription is rapidly shut down by DNA damage response (DDR) master regulators, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), using mechanisms that include the direct inhibition of Pol II elongation and the establishment of repressive chromatin environment.

Abstract\nGenome integrity is constantly challenged by endogenous and exogenous insults that cause DNA damage. To cope with these threats, cells have a surveillance mechanism, known as the DNA damage response (DDR), to repair any lesions. Although transcription has long been implicated in DNA repair, how transcriptional reprogramming is coordinated with the DDR is just beginning to be understood. In this review, we highlight recent advances in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying major transcriptional events, including RNA polymerase (Pol) II stalling and transcriptional silencing and recovery, which occur in response to DNA damage.

Here, we used anticodon-engineered transfer RNAs (ACE-tRNAs) as powerful precision switches to control the replication of PTC-containing viruses. We showed that ACE-tRNAs display higher potency of reading through PTCs than genetic code expansion (GCE) technology. Interestingly, ACE-tRNA has a site preference that may influence its read-through efficacy. We further attempted to use ACE-tRNAs as a novel viral vaccine platform. Using a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pseudotyped virus as an RNA virus model, we found that ACE-tRNAs display high potency for read-through viral PTCs and precisely control their production. Pseudorabies virus (PRV), a herpesvirus, was used as a DNA virus model. We found that ACE-tRNAs display high potency for reading through viral PTCs and precisely controlling PTC-containing virus replication. In addition, PTC-engineered PRV completely attenuated and lost virulence in mice in vivo, and immunization with PRV containing a PTC elicited a robust immune response and provided complete protection against wild-type PRV challenge. Overall, replication-controllable PTC-containing viruses based on ACE-tRNAs provide a new strategy to rapidly attenuate virus infection and prime robust immune responses.

However, it remains unclear how such a low-grade, yet persistent, inflammation is sustained in the liver. Here, we show that the macrophage phagocytic receptor TREM2, induced by hepatocyte-derived sphingosine-1-phosphate, was required for efferocytosis of lipid-laden apoptotic hepatocytes and thereby maintained liver immune homeostasis. However, prolonged hypernutrition led to the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1β in the liver to induce TREM2 shedding through ADAM17-dependent proteolytic cleavage. Loss of TREM2 resulted in aberrant accumulation of dying hepatocytes, thereby further augmenting proinflammatory cytokine production. This ultimately precipitated a vicious cycle that licensed chronic inflammation to drive simple steatosis transition to NASH. Therefore, impaired macrophage efferocytosis is a previously unrecognized key pathogenic event that enables chronic liver inflammation in obesity. Blocking TREM2 cleavage to restore efferocytosis may represent an effective strategy to treat NASH.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1670544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670544000,"objectID":"d371d18eb146bd43e5ed8d6b495c2c24","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36521495/","publishdate":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36521495/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nTREM2-dependent macrophage efferocytosis maintains immune homeostasis in the fatty liver Hepatocyte-derived S1P upregulates TREM2 in infiltrated liver macrophages Persistent obesity causes TREM2 shedding via TNF and IL-1β-induced proteolytic cleavage Loss of TREM2 disables efferocytosis to license chronic liver inflammation and NASH Summary","tags":["Immunology","Tissue Injury","Inflammation","Liver"],"title":"Prolonged hypernutrition impairs TREM2-dependent efferocytosis to license chronic liver inflammation and NASH development","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nDiarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), a globally prevalent functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, is associated with elevated serotonin that increases gut motility.

The reversible transformation from Ce3+ to Ce4+ could catalyze the decomposition of excess free radicals and act as a biological antioxidant enzyme basing on its strong ability to scavenge free radicals.

The results of high-throughput sequencing of mRNA showed that CNPs could protect renal epithelial cells from oxidative stress damage caused by high oxalate by suppressing the expression gene of cell surface adhesion proteins. In addition, CNPS can significantly reduce the pathological damage of renal tubules and inhibit the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in rat kidneys while having no significant side effect on other organs and physiological indicators in vivo.

We report that full-thickness injuries of reindeer antler skin (velvet) regenerate, whereas back skin forms fibrotic scar. Single-cell multi-omics reveal that uninjured velvet fibroblasts resemble human fetal fibroblasts, whereas back skin fibroblasts express inflammatory mediators mimicking pro-fibrotic adult human and rodent fibroblasts. Consequently, injury elicits site-specific immune responses: back skin fibroblasts amplify myeloid infiltration and maturation during repair, whereas velvet fibroblasts adopt an immunosuppressive phenotype that restricts leukocyte recruitment and hastens immune resolution. Ectopic transplantation of velvet to scar-forming back skin is initially regenerative, but progressively transitions to a fibrotic phenotype akin to the scarless fetal-to-scar-forming transition reported in humans. Skin regeneration is diminished by intensifying, or enhanced by neutralizing, these pathologic fibroblast-immune interactions.

The efficacy of TanFe was tested in mouse models of ACDMPV and Acute Lung Injury and in human vascular organoids derived from iPSCs of ACDMPV patient.\nMeasurements and main results: We identified HECTD1 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in ubiquitination and degradation of the FOXF1 protein.

In particular, expression of PD-L1 by various cancer cells has become a paradigm in this respect. Delivery of PD-L1 to its site of action occurs either by local diffusion, or else by transport via small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, commonly referred to as exosomes). Many steps of sEVs formation, their packaging with PD-L1 and their release into the extracellular space have been studied in detail. The likely dependence of release on Ca2+-signaling, however, has received little attention. This is surprising, since the intracellular Ca2+-concentration is known as a prominent regulator of many secretory processes. Here, we report on the roles of three Ca2+-dependent proteins in regulating release of PD-L1-containing sEVs, as well as on the growth of tumors in mouse models. We show that sEVs release in cancer cell lines is Ca2+-dependent and the knockdown of the gene coding the Ca2+-channel protein ORAI1 reduces Ca2+-signals and release of sEVs. Consequently, the T cell response is reinvigorated and tumor progression in mouse models is retarded. Furthermore, analysis of protein expression patterns in samples from human cancer tissue shows that the ORAI1 gene is significantly upregulated. Such upregulation is identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor for survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We show that reduced Ca2+-signaling after knockdown of ORAI1 gene also compromises the activity of melanophilin and Synaptotagmin-like protein 2, two proteins, which are important for correct localization of secretory organelles within cancer cells and their transport to sites of exocytosis. Thus, the Ca2+-channel ORAI1 and Ca2+-dependent proteins of the secretion pathway emerge as important targets for understanding and manipulating immune checkpoint blockade by PD-L1.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1670457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670457600,"objectID":"7f1f8e46be59161a25f83ba1e1707bdd","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36482876/","publishdate":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36482876/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBlockade of immune checkpoints as a strategy of cancer cells to overcome the immune response has received ample attention in cancer research recently.

As proof of concept, we demonstrate that these CM-NTUs enter chondrocytes through membrane fusion, avoid lysosome degradation and achieve rapid penetration. Moreover, the CM-NTUs increase intracellular ATP and NADPH levels in situ following exposure to light and improve anabolism in degenerated chondrocytes. They can also systemically correct energy imbalance and restore cellular metabolism to improve cartilage homeostasis and protect against pathological progression of osteoarthritis. Our therapeutic strategy for degenerative diseases is based on a natural photosynthetic system that can controllably enhance cell anabolism by independently providing key energy and metabolic carriers. This study also provides an enhanced understanding of the preparation and application of bioorganisms and composite biomaterials for the treatment of disease.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1670371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670371200,"objectID":"cd390c424601e780a00d8adc6906cfcc","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36477541/","publishdate":"2022-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36477541/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nInsufficient intracellular anabolism is a crucial factor involved in many pathological processes in the body.

Abstract\nAcute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but potentially fatal disease in children. The etiology is multifactorial, including infection, autoimmune, and genetic disorders, as well as indeterminate hepatitis, which has a higher requirement for liver transplantation. Activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems leads to hepatocyte-specific injury which is mitigated by T regulatory cell activation. Recovery of the native liver depends on activation of apoptotic and regenerative pathways, including the integrated stress response (ISR; e.g., PERK), p53, and HNF4α. Loss-of-function mutations in these pathways cause recurrent ALF in response to non-hepatotropic viruses. Deeper understanding of these mechanisms will lead to improved diagnosis, management, and outcomes for pediatric ALF.\n\u0026lt; Back to Reviews Alternative to Homepage ","date":1670371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670371200,"objectID":"fca30ceb7e79228e416bee429c1eff4f","permalink":"https://example.com/review/36496278/","publishdate":"2022-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/review/36496278/","section":"review","summary":"Highlights\nn 2022 an epidemic of acute hepatitis causing ALF, which affected children aged \u003c5 years, has drawn attention to the lack of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of ALF.

Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)–a novel target for anti-cancer drugs.

RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2.

Specifically, we find that rhythmic trafficking of DCs to the tumor draining lymph node (dLN) governs a circadian response of tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, which is dependent on circadian expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80. Consequently, cancer immunotherapy is more effective when synchronized with DC functions, shows circadian outcomes in mice and suggests similar effects in humans. These data demonstrate that circadian rhythms of anti-tumor immune components are not only critical for the control of tumor size but can also be exploited therapeutically.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1670198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670198400,"objectID":"565ae94646628111eb16b52de0b37dec","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36470303/","publishdate":"2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36470303/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nThe process of cancer immunosurveillance is a mechanism of tumor suppression that can protect the host from cancer development throughout its lifetime1,2.

However, existing exosome (Exo) delivery strategies cannot reach the angiogenesis phase following bone injury. To that end, an enzyme-sensitive Exo delivery material that responds to neovessel formation during the angiogenesis phase was designed in the present study to achieve spatiotemporally controlled Exo release. Herein, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) was found to be highly expressed in neovascularized bone; as a result, we proposed an injectable MMP1-sensitive hydrogel microspheres (KGE) made using a microfluidic chip prepared by mixing self-assembling peptide (KLDL-MMP1), GelMA, and BMSC-Exos. The results revealed that KGE microspheres had a uniform diameter of 50-70 μm, ideal for minimally invasive injection and could release exosomes in response to MMP1 expression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that KGE had less cytotoxicity and could promote the migration and osteodifferentiation of BMSCs. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that KGE could promote bone repair during angiogenesis by recruiting CD90+ stem cells via neovessels. Collectively, our results suggest that injectable enzyme-responsive KGE microspheres could be a promising Exo-secreting material for accelerating neovascularized bone healing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Exosomes can spread through blood vessels and activate stem cells to participate in bone repair, but under normal circumstances, exosomes lacking sustained-release delivery materials cannot be maintained until the angiogenesis phase. In this study, we found that MMP1 was highly expressed in neovascularized bone, then we proposed an MMP1-sensitive injectable microsphere that carries exosomes and responds temporally and spatially to neovascularization, which maximizes the ability of exosomes to recruit stem cells. Different from previous strategies that focus on promoting angiogenesis to accelerate bone healing, this is a brand new delivery strategy that is stimuli-responsive to neovessel formation. In addition, the preparation of self-assembled peptide microspheres by a microfluidic chip is also proposed for the first time.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1670198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670198400,"objectID":"b0961f5f63b52b8ae345def4b9f1820c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36481504/","publishdate":"2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36481504/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exos) can recruit stem cells for bone repair, with neovessels serving as the main migratory channel for stem cells to the injury site.

JCAD promotes experimental atherosclerosis through the large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2)/Hippo pathway. This study investigates the role of JCAD in arterial thrombosis.\nMethods and results: JCAD knockout (Jcad-/-) mice underwent photochemically induced endothelial injury to trigger arterial thrombosis. Primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) treated with JCAD small interfering RNA (siJCAD), LATS2 small interfering RNA (siLATS2) or control siRNA (siSCR) were employed for in vitro assays. Plasma JCAD was measured in patients with chronic coronary syndrome or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Jcad-/- mice displayed reduced thrombogenicity as reflected by delayed time to carotid occlusion. Mechanisms include reduced activation of the coagulation cascade [reduced tissue factor (TF) expression and activity] and increased fibrinolysis [higher thrombus embolization episodes and D-dimer levels, reduced vascular plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 expression]. In vitro, JCAD silencing inhibited TF and PAI-1 expression in HAECs. JCAD-silenced HAECs (siJCAD) displayed increased levels of LATS2 kinase. Yet, double JCAD and LATS2 silencing did not restore the control phenotype. si-JCAD HAECs showed increased levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/proteinkinase B (Akt) activation, known to downregulate procoagulant expression. The PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor-wortmannin-prevented the effect of JCAD silencing on TF and PAI-1, indicating a causative role. Also, co-immunoprecipitation unveiled a direct interaction between JCAD and Akt. Confirming in vitro findings, PI3K/Akt and P-yes-associated protein levels were higher in Jcad-/- animals. Lastly, as compared with chronic coronary syndrome, STEMI patients showed higher plasma JCAD, which notably correlated positively with both TF and PAI-1 levels.\nConclusions: JCAD promotes arterial thrombosis by modulating coagulation and fibrinolysis.

By preserving epithelial integrity, mannose reduced the inflammatory activation of colonic macrophages.

Additionally, we found dysregulated mannose metabolism in the colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, we revealed that activating PMM2 activity with epalrestat, a clinically approved drug for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, elicited further sensitization to the therapeutic effect of mannose.

Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)–a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2.

Given the anti-inflammatory role of the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2R), the effect of CB2R activation in the regulation of PA-induced ALI and inflammation was tested in a mouse model as an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy.\nMethods: In order to activate CB2R, a selective synthetic agonist, JWH133, was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, SR144528 (a selective CB2R antagonist) was administered in combination with JWH133 to test the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effect. PA was administered intratracheally (i.t.) for induction of pneumonia in mice. At 24 h after PA exposure, lung mechanics were measured using the FlexiVent system. The total cell number, protein content, and neutrophil population in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. The bacterial load in the whole lung was also measured. Lung injury was evaluated by histological examination and PA-induced inflammation was assessed by measuring the levels of BALF cytokines and chemokines. Neutrophil activation (examined by immunofluorescence and immunoblot) and PA-induced inflammatory signaling (analyzed by immunoblot) were also studied.\nResults: CB2R activation by JWH133 was found to significantly reduce PA-induced ALI and the bacterial burden. CB2R activation also suppressed the PA-induced increase in immune cell infiltration, neutrophil population, and inflammatory cytokines. These effects were abrogated by a CB2R antagonist, SR144528, further confirming the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effects. CB2R-knock out (CB2RKO) mice had a significantly higher level of PA-induced inflammation as compared to that in WT mice. CB2R activation diminished the excess activation of neutrophils, whereas mice lacking CB2R had elevated neutrophil activation. Pharmacological activation of CB2R significantly reduced the PA-induced NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, whereas CB2KO mice had elevated NLRP3 inflammasome.\nConclusion: Our findings indicate that CB2R activation ameliorates PA-induced lung injury and inflammation, thus paving the path for new therapeutic avenues against PA pneumonia.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1670025600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670025600,"objectID":"6d93547800e17645e0d50fa396d56ee9","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36463179/","publishdate":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36463179/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Bacterial pneumonia is a major risk factor for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

CD44 has been implicated in endothelial cell functions and its role has been well established in angiogenesis for years. Although recent studies indicate the close correlation between CD44 and exosome, as well as the two being implicated in myocardial ischemia pathological processes, the effect and the underlying mechanism of CD44 and its regulated plasma exosome in pathological angiogenesis post-myocardial infarction have not been fully elucidated.\nMethods\nIn this study, we used CD44 knockout mice to study the in vivo impacts of CD44 on ischemic angiogenesis in myocardial infarction. Mouse cardiac function was measured by echocardiography, histological changes were observed by Evans Blue and TTC-double staining and Masson’s trichrome staining, and molecular changes were detected by immunofluorescence. In the in vitro study, CD44 knockout HUVECs were generated and CD44 inhibitor was used to study the mechanism of CD44 on angiogenesis. We performed the immunoprecipitation, proximity ligation assay, and super-resolution imaging to study the mechanistic regulation of FGFR2 signaling transduction by CD44. Importantly, we also isolated plasma exosomes from myocardial infarction model mice and studied the effect of plasma exosomes on the activation of the FGFR2 signaling pathway and the related phenotypic alterations, including exosomes uptake and angiogenic function in primary mouse microvascular endothelial cells, and further discovered the regulation mechanism of exosomal miRNAs.\nResults\nWe observed that the expression of CD44 in the border zone of the infarcted heart was tightly related to pathological angiogenesis following myocardial ischemia. The depletion of CD44 impaired angiogenesis and impacts biogenesis and proangiogenic function of plasma exosomes. Subsequently, we found that CD44 mediated the activation of the FGFR2 signaling pathway as well as the caveolin 1-dependent uptake of exosomes in vascular endothelial cells. Most importantly, the proangiogenic therapeutic effect of plasma exosomal miRNAs depended upon the participation of CD44/FGFR2 signaling transduction in vascular endothelial cells.\nConclusion\nCD44 and its regulated plasma exosomes have crucial potent angiogenic activity. Our studies elucidate that CD44 plays a key role in plasma exosomal miRNA-enhanced angiogenic FGFR2 singling transduction and ischemic angiogenesis in the early stage of myocardial infarction.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1670025600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670025600,"objectID":"518e60ec7052f10f91763158ca7690de","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36463112/","publishdate":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36463112/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground\nSince angiogenesis occurs as the pathological process following myocardial infarction to alleviate ischemia, therapeutic angiogenesis has been proposed to be a cardioprotective strategy.

Here, we introduce an algorithm, eNet, to build enhancer networks by integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles. The complexity of enhancer networks is assessed by two metrics: the number of enhancers and the frequency of predicted enhancer interactions (PEIs) based on chromatin co-accessibility. We apply eNet algorithm to a human blood dataset and find cell identity and disease genes tend to be regulated by complex enhancer networks. The network hub enhancers (enhancers with frequent PEIs) are the most functionally important. Compared with super-enhancers, enhancer networks show better performance in predicting cell identity and disease genes. eNet is robust and widely applicable in various human or mouse tissues datasets. Thus, we propose a model of enhancer networks containing three modes: Simple, Multiple and Complex, which are distinguished by their complexity in regulating gene expression.

Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)–a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1670025600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670025600,"objectID":"b2cfebcb68e924b6ab477f7d2630c3a0","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36461756/","publishdate":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36461756/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nTherapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer.

Further experiments revealed that the upregulation of JMJD3 and proinflammatory effects were possibly exerted by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or oxidized-mtDNA from tissue injury caused by AP. The release of mtDNA and oxidized-mtDNA contributed to the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes in lung injury through the stimulator of IFN genes (STING)/TLR9-NF-κB-JMJD3-TNF-α pathway. The inhibition of JMJD3 or utilization of Jmjd3-cKO mice significantly alleviated pulmonary inflammation induced by AP. Blocking mtDNA oxidation or knocking down the TLR9/STING pathway effectively alleviated inflammation.

Therefore, there is a need to develop a promising strategy to improve the immunogenicity and safety of vaccines.\nMethods: We developed a splenic-targeting biomimetic nanovaccine (NV) that can boost protective humoral and cellular immunity against african swine fever virus (ASFV) infection. The universal PLGA nanoparticles (CMR-PLGA/p54 NPs) coated with mannose and CpG (TLR9 agonist) co-modified red blood cell (RBC) membrane were prepared, which comprised a viral antigen (p54) and can be served as a versatile nanovaccine for elevating protective immunity.\nResults: CMR-PLGA/p54 NVs could be effectively uptaken by BMDC and promoted BMDC maturation in vitro. After subcutaneous immunization, antigen could be effectively delivered to the splenic dendritic cells (DCs) due to the splenic homing ability of RBC and DC targeting capacity of mannose, which promoted antigen presentation and DCs maturation, and further elicited higher levels of cytokines secretion and specific IgG titers, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells activation and B maturation.

Transcriptomic analyses identified inflammatory response as a major target of Caspase-8, and in particular, NFκB signaling as one of the most affected pathways.

However, the underlying mechanism by which the ruminal microbiota participates in the development of mastitis remains unknown.\nResults: In the present study, we found that cows with clinical mastitis had marked systemic inflammation, which was associated with significant ruminal dysbiosis, especially enriched Proteobacteria in the rumen. Ruminal microbiota transplantation from mastitis cows (M-RMT) to mice induced mastitis symptoms in recipient mice along with increased mammary proinflammatory signature activation of the TLR4-cGAS-STING-NF-κB/NLRP3 pathways. M-RMT also induced mucosal inflammation and impaired intestinal barrier integrity, leading to increased endotoxemia and systemic inflammation. Moreover, we showed that M-RMT mirrored ruminal microbiota disruption in the gut of recipient mice, as evidenced by enriched Proteobacteria and similar bacterial functions, which were correlated with most proinflammatory parameters and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in mice. Recurrent low-grade LPS treatment mirrored gut dysbiosis-induced endotoxemia and caused severe mastitis in mice. Furthermore, we found that gut dysbiosis-derived LPS reduced host alkaline phosphatase activity by activating neuraminidase (Neu), which facilitates low-grade LPS exposure and E. coli-induced mastitis in mice. Conversely, treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase or the Neu inhibitor zanamivir alleviated low-grade LPS exposure and E. coli-induced mastitis in mice.\nConclusions: Our results suggest that ruminal dysbiosis-derived low-grade endotoxemia can cause mastitis and aggravate pathogen-induced mastitis by impairing host anti-inflammatory enzymes, which implies that regulating the ruminal or gut microbiota to prevent low-grade systemic inflammation is a potential strategy for mastitis intervention.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"0ea97043dec4c3b08c05b2d2eebab73b","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36451232/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36451232/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Mounting experimental evidence has shown that the gut microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of mastitis, and clinical investigations have found that the occurrence of mastitis is correlated with ruminal dysbiosis.","tags":["Intestine","Microbiome","Immunology","Inflammation","Microbiology","Microbial Infections","Host-Pathogen Interactions","Interactome","Breast","Obstetrics \u0026 Gynaecology"],"title":"Gut dysbiosis induces the development of mastitis through a reduction in host anti-inflammatory enzyme activity by endotoxemia","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nAcute lung injury (ALI) is a common critical disease, which is characterized by an uncontrolled, acute inflammatory response, diffuse lung damage and ultimately directly deteriorates into acute respiratory distress syndrome. The number of pro-inflammatory macrophages is related to the severity of ALI. Up-regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophage apoptosis can reduce the pro-inflammatory reactions. Jumonji domain-containing protein D3 (JMJD3)-mediated histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) demethylation may promote the pro-inflammatory response of macrophages under LPS stimulation. However, the mechanism of JMJD3 affecting macrophage apoptosis is still not clear. To explore this gap in knowledge, the ALI mice model with intratracheal administration of LPS and RAW264.7 cells with LPS stimulation were used as in vivo and in vitro experiments. The expression of JMJD3 and H3K27me3 and their cellular localization were analysed in lung tissue. Apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL staining and flow cytometry. Expression of H3K27me3, ADORA2A and C/EBPβ were compared among different treatments and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to investigate the regulatory relationship. Our study showed that JMJD3 expression was upregulated in LPS-induced ALI mice and RAW264.7 cells. JMJD3-indued H3K27me3 demethylation inhibited caspase-3 cleavage by upregulating ADORA2A to decrease LPS-stimulated macrophage apoptosis and promoted the inflammatory reaction. This H3K27me3 demethylation also increased C/EBPβ expression, which may enhance ADORA2A expression further. Besides, inhibiting ADORA2A can also promote LPS-limited macrophage apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of JMJD3 in vivo and in vitro relieved the inhibition of macrophage apoptosis thus leading to the resolution of the inflammation. JMJD3 might inhibit macrophage apoptosis by promoting ADORA2A expression in LPS-induced ALI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"fc7c39551a98432cf23e7c130858e091","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36456564/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36456564/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nAcute lung injury (ALI) is a common critical disease, which is characterized by an uncontrolled, acute inflammatory response, diffuse lung damage and ultimately directly deteriorates into acute respiratory distress syndrome.","tags":["Cell Death","Tissue Injury","Lung","Apoptosis"],"title":"H3K27 tri-demethylase JMJD3 inhibits macrophage apoptosis by promoting ADORA2A in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nTargeted immunotherapy has improved patient survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but less than 20% of patients produce a durable response to these treatments.

Cell death is a core event that leads to diabetic heart dysfunction. However, the time sequence of cell death pathways and the precise time to intervene of particular cell death type remain largely unknown in the diabetic heart. This study aims to identify the particular cell death type that is responsible for diabetic heart dysfunction and to propose a promising therapeutic strategy by intervening in the cell death pathway.\nMethods: Type 2 diabetes models were established using db/db leptin receptor-deficient mice and high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced mice. The type 1 diabetes model was established in streptozotocin-induced mice. Apoptosis and programmed cell necrosis (necroptosis) were detected in diabetic mouse hearts at different ages. G protein-coupled receptor-targeted drug library was searched to identify potential receptors regulating the key cell death pathway. Pharmacological and genetic approaches that modulate the expression of targets were used. Stable cell lines and a homemade phosphorylation antibody were prepared to conduct mechanistic studies.\nResults: Necroptosis was activated after apoptosis at later stages of diabetes and was functionally responsible for cardiac dysfunction. Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) was a key regulator of necroptosis. Mechanically, during normal glucose levels, CB2R inhibited S6 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of BACH2 at serine 520, thereby leading to BACH2 translocation to the nucleus, where BACH2 transcriptionally repressed the necroptosis genes Rip1, Rip3, and Mlkl. Under hyperglycemic conditions, high glucose induced CB2R internalization in a β-arrestin 2-dependent manner; thereafter, MLKL (mixed lineage kinase domain-like), but not receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 or 3, phosphorylated CB2R at serine 352 and promoted CB2R degradation by ubiquitin modification. Cardiac re-expression of CB2R rescued diabetes-induced cardiomyocyte necroptosis and heart dysfunction, whereas cardiac knockout of Bach2 diminished CB2R-mediated beneficial effects. In human diabetic hearts, both CB2R and BACH2 were negatively associated with diabetes-induced myocardial injuries.\nConclusions: CB2R transcriptionally repressed necroptosis through interaction with BACH2; in turn, MLKL formed a negative feedback to phosphorylate CB2R. Our study provides the integrative view of a novel molecular mechanism loop for regulation of necroptosis centered by CB2R, which represents a promising alternative strategy for controlling diabetic heart dysfunction.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669766400,"objectID":"8d7c993f7e56d186c452f17a0813378c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36448459/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36448459/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Diabetic heart dysfunction is a common complication of diabetes.

In the study, the expression of FFAR4 was abnormally decreased in tubular epithelial cells (TECs) of cisplatin, cecal ligation/perforation and ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced AKI mice, respectively. Systemic and conditional TEC-specific knockout of FFAR4 aggravated renal function and pathological damage, whereas FFAR4 activation by TUG-891 alleviated the severity of disease in cisplatin-induced AKI mice. Notably, FFAR4, as a key determinant, was firstly explored to regulate cellular senescence both in injured kidneys of AKI mice and TECs, which was indicated by senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, marker protein p53, p21, Lamin B1, phospho-histone H2A.X, phospho-Rb expression, and secretory phenotype IL-6 level.

IRF1 then attaches to the STAT1 promoter region to initiate the transcription of STAT1 and polarization of macrophage M1. IRF1 has been identified as the essential molecule that controls the macrophage M1 polarization and the onset of septic ARDS. Abstract\nBackground\nA growing body of research has shown that the phenotypic change in macrophages from M0 to M1 is essential for the start of the inflammatory process in septic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Potential treatment targets might be identified with more knowledge of the molecular regulation of M1 macrophages in septic ARDS.\nMethods\nA multi-microarray interrelated analysis of high-throughput experiments from ARDS patients and macrophage polarization was conducted to identify the hub genes associated with macrophage M1 polarization and septic ARDS. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Poly (I:C) were utilized to stimulate bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) for M1-polarized macrophage model construction. Knock down of the hub genes on BMDMs via shRNAs was used to screen the genes regulating macrophage M1 polarization in vitro. The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model was constructed in knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice to explore whether the screened genes regulate macrophage M1 polarization in septic ARDS in vivo. ChIP-seq and further experiments on BMDMs were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism.\nResults\nThe bioinformatics analysis of gene expression profiles from a clinical cohort of 26 ARDS patients and macrophage polarization found that the 5 hub genes (IFIH1, IRF1, STAT1, IFIT3, GBP1) may have a synergistic effect on macrophage M1 polarization in septic ARDS. Further in vivo investigations indicated that IFIH1, STAT1 and IRF1 contribute to macrophage M1 polarization. The histological evaluation and immunohistochemistry of the lungs from the IRF1-/- and WT mice indicated that knockout of IRF1 markedly alleviated CLP-induced lung injury and M1-polarized infiltration. Moreover, the molecular mechanism investigations indicated that knockdown of IFIH1 markedly promoted IRF1 translocation into the nucleus. Knockout of IRF1 significantly decreases the expression of STAT1. ChIP-seq and PCR further confirmed that IRF1, as a transcription factor of STAT1, binds to the promoter region of STAT1.\nConclusion\nIRF1 was identified as the key molecule that regulates macrophage M1polarization and septic ARDS development in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, as the adaptor in response to infection mimics irritants, IFIH1 promotes IRF1 (transcription factor) translocation into the nucleus to initiate STAT1 transcription.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669766400,"objectID":"46eea253844765fa08769d6b98da9691","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36462334/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36462334/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nIFIH1 is activated by infection, which triggers the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor IRF1.

The inability to comprehensively control COVID-19 is due to the difficulty of early and timely diagnosis, the lack of effective therapeutic drugs, and the limited effectiveness of vaccines. The body contains billions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have shown remarkable potential in disease diagnosis, drug development, and vaccine carriers. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that EVs may participate or assist the body in defence, antagonism, recovery and acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2. On the one hand, intercepting and decrypting the general intelligence carried in circulating EVs from COVID-19 patients will provide an important hint for diagnosis and treatment; on the other hand, engineered EVs modified by gene editing in the laboratory will amplify the effectiveness of inhibiting infection, replication and destruction of ever-mutating SARS-CoV-2, facilitating tissue repair and making a better vaccine. To comprehensively understand the interaction between EVs and SARS-CoV-2, providing new insights to overcome some difficulties in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19, we conducted a rounded review in this area. We also explain numerous critical challenges that these tactics face before they enter the clinic, and this work will provide previous ‘meet change with constancy’ lessons for responding to future similar public health disasters. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide a ‘meet changes with constancy’ strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2 that spans defence, antagonism, recovery, and acquired immunity. Targets for COVID-19 diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of progression may be found by capture of the message decoding in circulating EVs. Engineered and biomimetic EVs can boost effects of the natural EVs, especially anti-SARS-CoV-2, targeted repair of damaged tissue, and improvement of vaccine efficacy.\n\u0026lt; Back to Reviews Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669766400,"objectID":"26ac2641f02faa2e299b4c67f2385dec","permalink":"https://example.com/review/36450704/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/review/36450704/","section":"review","summary":"Abstract\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has wrought havoc on the world economy and people’s daily lives.

Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)–a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669766400,"objectID":"fae982cc0ab6a70e85c41a0682fcc714","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36449507/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36449507/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nTherapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer.

Coupling our clonal skin HRASG12V mouse model with single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin landscaping, lentiviral reporters and lineage tracing, we show that aberrant crosstalk between cancer stem cells and their microenvironment triggers angiogenesis and TGFβ signalling, creating conditions that are conducive for hijacking leptin and leptin receptor signalling, which in turn launches downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR signalling during the benign-to-malignant transition.

The effort involved in between—the background research, experimentation, data analysis, etc. that define the investigation—is typically in the hands of the students and fellows.\nThe input encompasses setting a research project goal, often consisting of an applied target accompanied by a key scientific question that needs to be addressed to inform a new design to meet said applied target. At this initial stage in the process, I offer my own reflections on the student’s project vision and strategy/plan, but, at least as importantly, I seek to bring together a small team to critique, iteratively, the student’s target, hypothesis, and plan of approach.\nThe output involves communicating the results to others—i.e., creating the manuscript for submission to the journal. This article is about our process regarding the output.\nSeven tips on crafting papers\nThe art of positive visualization: start with the figure set. I learned early in my career from eminent colleagues that one good strategy can be to start with the figure set. even before we have the full and final set of data for the paper! It’s a great aid for crafting the logic and flow of the paper. The holes in this emerging figure set are the still-remaining work items on the critical path to the paper. This helps the first author prioritize the remaining time spent.\nOutline the logical flow and narrative: get lots of feedback at this stage. This is the time to iterate and optimize the logical flow. Before writing prose, write—as bullets or a flowchart—the logical sequence of ideas, and transitions therebetween, that will make the work most clear. Discuss this a lot with colleagues and advisors. When you get this right, the manuscript will (almost!) write itself. This is the time to iterate, shuffle the deck, reorder, or realize there’s one key experiment missing. If you get lots of feedback at this stage, there will be fewer tears later—such as when you present a “perfect” manuscript to your advisor that you’ve polished so much that you can’t bear to see changes/edits.\nThe best narratives are almost never chronological accounts of your actual real-time journey through the project. You did the work in some order: you had an idea, you tried it, it failed, you had another idea, you thought that worked but later discovered it was an artifact, you went to play Spikeball, etc. Not only do you not need to tell the story in the order in which it happened. but it will be hard to follow if you do. See item 2 above: work with the outline; iterate on the outline; and develop a sequence that flows, is easy to follow, and engages the reader.\nFailed early attempts can help you create a dramatic tension and a feeling of anticipation in the reader. Sometimes I see drafts in which, early in the abstract and also early in the manuscript, we jump too soon to: “Here we find that, by using 2-N,4-N,6-N,8-N-snuffleupagus(3-methylphenyl)py rimido[5,4-d]pyrimidine-2,4,6,8-tetramine as hole transport layer, we achieved a record solar PCE.” If the first thing that we tried had worked, the accomplishment is less likely to have been a substantive advance informed by deep and original reasoning.\nIf you look back at how the work actually went in the lab, often your first attempts—the preludes to your eventual and ultimate success—did not proceed as hoped. You tried the obvious things that a reasonable expert would have done. and the approach failed. This sets the stage for your eventual accomplishment and will highlight that it was not trivial at all: instead, it required innovation. We then seek to learn from these failures—study their origins. What is it, mechanistically, that accounts for the fact that known prior art, when straightforwardly combined, failed to produce the intended result?\nThese studies may well spotlight a factor that has been previously overlooked or underemphasized. The new model you develop will inform how you’ll innovate your way out of the problem: only by doing X were we able to overcome this now-understood mechanism that we now know was at the root of the failure of the obvious combination.\nThe approach I outline above isn’t the only way to write an interesting and engaging paper. It illustrates a broader principle that does cut across many good papers: they have a plot. Often there are struggles and disappointments; then a suite of studies motivated by curiosity, driven forth by the instinct to investigate; then a phase of inno\u0002vation enabled by the resultant insights; finishing with a significant achievement that relied on the innovative step.\nStand proudly on the shoulders of giants and delineate clearly when this tribute is complete and where we have moved on to your original work.

To gain insight into the process of mucosal healing, we longitudinally examined the immune cell composition during intestinal damage and regeneration. B cells were the dominant cell type in the healing colon, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed expansion of an IFN-induced B cell subset during experimental mucosal healing that predominantly located in damaged areas and associated with colitis severity. B cell depletion accelerated recovery upon injury, decreased epithelial ulceration, and enhanced gene expression programs associated with tissue remodeling. scRNA-seq from the epithelial and stromal compartments combined with spatial transcriptomics and multiplex immunostaining showed that B cells decreased interactions between stromal and epithelial cells during mucosal healing. Activated B cells disrupted the epithelial-stromal cross talk required for organoid survival. Thus, B cell expansion during injury impairs epithelial-stromal cell interactions required for mucosal healing, with implications for the treatment of IBD.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669680000,"objectID":"9655ac0a354c80812c1a69e9934dcc86","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36462502/","publishdate":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36462502/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nB cells are the dominant immune cell type during colonic mucosal healing (MH)\nIFN-induced B cells are associated with injury and expand during MH\nB cell depletion results in enhanced MH following intestinal injury","tags":["Organoid","Immunology","Single Cell","Inflammation"],"title":"B cell expansion hinders the stroma-epithelium regenerative cross talk during mucosal healing","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nBackground: Excess cholesterol accumulation in lesional macrophages elicits complex responses in atherosclerosis. Epsins, a family of endocytic adaptors, fuel the progression of atherosclerosis; however, the underlying mechanism and therapeutic potential of targeting Epsins remains unknown. In this study, we determined the role of Epsins in macrophage-mediated metabolic regulation. We then developed an innovative method to therapeutically target macrophage Epsins with specially designed S2P-conjugated lipid nanoparticles, which encapsulate small-interfering RNAs to suppress Epsins.\nMethods: We used single-cell RNA sequencing with our newly developed algorithm MEBOCOST to study cell-cell communications mediated by metabolites from sender cells and sensor proteins on receiver cells. Biomedical, cellular, and molecular approaches were utilized to investigate the role of macrophage Epsins in regulating lipid metabolism and transport. We performed this study using myeloid-specific Epsin double knockout (LysM-DKO) mice and mice with a genetic reduction of ABCG1 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1; LysM-DKO-ABCG1fl/+). The nanoparticles targeting lesional macrophages were developed to encapsulate interfering RNAs to treat atherosclerosis.\nResults: We revealed that Epsins regulate lipid metabolism and transport in atherosclerotic macrophages. Inhibiting Epsins by nanotherapy halts inflammation and accelerates atheroma resolution. Harnessing lesional macrophage-specific nanoparticle delivery of Epsin small-interfering RNAs, we showed that silencing of macrophage Epsins diminished atherosclerotic plaque size and promoted plaque regression. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Epsins bound to CD36 to facilitate lipid uptake by enhancing CD36 endocytosis and recycling. Conversely, Epsins promoted ABCG1 degradation via lysosomes and hampered ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport. In a LysM-DKO-ABCG1fl/+ mouse model, enhanced cholesterol efflux and reverse transport due to Epsin deficiency was suppressed by the reduction of ABCG1.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that targeting Epsins in lesional macrophages may offer therapeutic benefits for advanced atherosclerosis by reducing CD36-mediated lipid uptake and increasing ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux. \u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669680000,"objectID":"cb7f4b7de7ab0d8e9e4c1ced6a07402c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36444722/","publishdate":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36444722/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Excess cholesterol accumulation in lesional macrophages elicits complex responses in atherosclerosis.

Current models of distal epithelial lineage formation fail to capture the heterogeneity and dynamic contribution of progenitor pools present during early development. Furthermore, few studies explore the pathways involved in alveolar progenitor specification and fate.

Our results suggest that a significant proportion of AT2 and AT1 progenitors are lineage-flexible during late pseudoglandular stage development, and that lineage commitment is regulated in part by FGFR2b signalling. We have characterized a set of direct FGFR2b targets at E16.5 which are likely involved in alveolar lineage formation. These signature genes converge on a subpopulation of AT2 cells later in development and are downregulated in AT2 cells transitioning to the AT1 lineage during repair after injury in adults.

Among the miRNAs, miR-181a-3p and miR-223-3p notably reduced the PD-L1 protein levels in melanoma cells. Interestingly, miR-181a-3p increased the activity of CD8+ T cells while suppressing Treg cell activity. IL2-sEVs inhibited tumour progression in melanoma-bearing immunocompetent mice, but not in immunodeficient mice. The combination of IL2-sEVs and existing anti-cancer drugs significantly improved anti-cancer efficacy by decreasing PD-L1 expression in vivo. Thus, IL2-sEVs are potential cancer immunotherapeutic agents that regulate both immune and cancer cells by reprogramming miRNA levels.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669680000,"objectID":"119423679c628af8b8dc1940dbb6d937","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36447429/","publishdate":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36447429/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nT cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) exhibit anti-cancer effects.

Here, we show that N-Myc transcriptionally activates the long noncoding RNA MILIP to promote nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair through facilitating Ku70-Ku80 heterodimerization in neuroblastoma cells. High MILIP expression was associated with poor outcome and appeared as an independent prognostic factor in neuroblastoma patients. Knockdown of MILIP reduced neuroblastoma cell viability through the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation, retarded neuroblastoma xenograft growth, and sensitized neuroblastoma cells to DNA-damaging therapeutics. The effect of MILIP knockdown was associated with the accumulation of DNA DSBs in neuroblastoma cells largely due to decreased activity of the NHEJ DNA repair pathway. Mechanistical investigations revealed that binding of MILIP to Ku70 and Ku80 increased their heterodimerization, and this was required for MILIP-mediated promotion of NHEJ DNA repair. Disrupting the interaction between MILIP and Ku70 or Ku80 increased DNA DSBs and reduced cell viability with therapeutic potential revealed where targeting MILIP using Gapmers cooperated with the DNA-damaging drug cisplatin to inhibit neuroblastoma growth in vivo. Collectively, our findings identify MILIP as an N-Myc downstream effector critical for activation of the NHEJ DNA repair pathway in neuroblastoma cells, with practical implications of MILIP targeting, alone and in combination with DNA-damaging therapeutics, for neuroblastoma treatment.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669680000,"objectID":"9ee5503bec0581980de77cf04758203c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36445966/","publishdate":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36445966/","section":"article","summary":"Significance\nHere, we report that the lncRNA MILIP is transcriptionally regulated by N-Myc and functions to promote DNA double-strand break repair in neuroblastoma cells.

In human neural progenitor cells, NS5 inhibits the transcription of numerous neural genes by binding onto their gene body and blocking PAF1C-mediated transcription elongation. The expression of ZIKV NS5 disrupts neurogenesis in developing mouse brain. Our findings reveal a role of ZIKV RdRp as a DNA binding protein to regulate host gene transcription and provide insights into abnormal neurodevelopment and ZIKV infection.\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) targets the neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in brain during intrauterine infections and consequently causes severe neurological disorders, such as microcephaly in neonates. Although replicating in the cytoplasm, ZIKV dysregulates the expression of thousands of host genes, yet the detailed mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we report that ZIKV encodes a unique DNA-binding protein to regulate host gene transcription in the nucleus. We found that ZIKV NS5, the viral RNA polymerase, associates tightly with host chromatin DNA through its methyltransferase domain and this interaction could be specifically blocked by GTP. Further study showed that expression of ZIKV NS5 in human NPCs markedly suppressed the transcription of its target genes, especially the genes involved in neurogenesis. Mechanistically, ZIKV NS5 binds onto the gene body of its target genes and then blocks their transcriptional elongation. The utero electroporation in pregnant mice showed that NS5 expression significantly disrupts the neurogenesis by reducing the number of Sox2- and Tbr2-positive cells in the fetal cortex.

In particular, SiNPs greatly enhanced pulmonary ROS and TUNEL positive rate in lungs, both of which were positively correlated with lung impairments. Further, the underlying mechanisms were investigated in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). Consistent with the in vivo findings, SiNPs caused the impairments on mitochondrial structure, as well as the activation of ROS generation and oxidative injury. Upon SiNPs stimuli, mitochondrial respiration was greatly inhibited, while Ca2+ overload in cytosol and mitochondria owing to ER calcium release was noticed, resulting in mitochondrial-dependent epithelial apoptosis. More importantly, mitochondrial dynamics was imbalanced toward a fission type, as evidenced by upregulated DRP1 and its phosphorylation at Ser616 (DRP1s616), while downregulated DRP1s637, and also MFN1, MFN2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the activation of ROS/Ca2+ signaling promoted DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission by SiNPs, forming a vicious cycle, and ultimately contributing to apoptosis in 16HBE.

In these NLRP3-NEK7-ASC complexes, the central NACHT domain of NLRP3 assumes an ATP-bound conformation in which two of its subdomains rotate by ~85° relative to the ADP-bound inactive conformation. The FISNA domain conserved in NLRP3 but absent in most NLRPs becomes ordered in its key regions to stabilize the active NACHT conformation and mediate most interactions in the disk. Mutations on these interactions compromise NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 activation. The N-terminal PYDs from all the NLRP3 subunits gather together to form a PYD filament that recruits ASC PYD to elicit downstream signalling. Surprisingly, the C-terminal LRR domain and the LRR-bound NEK7 do not participate in disk interfaces.

Interestingly, sEVs lactadherin was also internalized by macrophages and IECs, leading to macrophage M2 polarization and enhanced intestinal barrier integrity.

Therefore, the functions of EVs have been extensively characterized and EVs exhibit an exciting prospect for clinical applications. However, the biogenesis of EVs and, in particular, the regulation of this process by extracellular signals, which are essential to conduct further studies and support optimal utility, remain unclear. Here, we review the current understanding of the biogenesis of EVs, focus on the regulation of this process by extracellular signals and discuss their therapeutic value.\n\u0026lt; Back to Reviews Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669420800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669420800,"objectID":"e0aa7bcee6bfd87d65560c98404bf019","permalink":"https://example.com/review/36435789/","publishdate":"2022-11-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/review/36435789/","section":"review","summary":"Abstract\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are naturally released membrane vesicles that act as carriers of proteins and RNAs for intercellular communication.

Abstract\nThere is no gold standard for evaluating the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and it is still based on a score. This study aimed to use the metabolomics method to find promised biomarkers in assessing disease severity and potential therapeutic targets for CAP. The result found that the metabolites in the plasma samples of CAP patients had significantly different between the acute phase and the remission phase, especially lysophosphatidylcholine (LPCs) in glycerophospholipids, whose levels are negatively linked to the severity of the disease. Subsequently, the two key metabolites of myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC 14:0) and LPC 16:1 were screened. We analyzed the predictive performance of the two metabolites using Spearman-related analysis and ROC curves, and LPC14:0 showed more satisfactory diagnostic performance than LPC16:1. Then we explored the protective role and mechanism of LPC 14:0 in animal and cell models. The results showed that LPC 14:0 could inhibit the LPS-induced secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, lower the ROS and MDA levels, and decreased the depletion of SOD and GSH, thereby reducing lung tissue and cell damage, such as down-regulating the protein level in BALF, lung W/D ratio, MPO activity, and apoptosis. We found that LPC 14:0 inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress, and the above protection was achieved by inhibiting LPS-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. LPC 14:0 may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting the severity of CAP. In addition, our exploration of the role of LPC 14:0 in animal and cellular models has reinforced its promise as a therapeutic target to improve the clinical efficacy for CAP.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669420800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669420800,"objectID":"02403c3e2016e7e769542f61d78d5991","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36459717/","publishdate":"2022-11-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36459717/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nLysophosphatidylcholine decreases in CAP patients during the acute phase of the disease.

Abstract\nAcute lung injury (ALI) is featured by intensive inflammatory responses causing significant morbidity and mortality. Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), induced by interferon (IFN), has been discovered to modulate viral infection and cell apoptosis and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, it’s role and mechanism in ALI remain unclear and need to be explored furtherly. Here, we discovered that IFIT1 decreased the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in mouse-derived macrophage cells (MH-S) and alleviated apoptosis of murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) induced by MH-S cell supernatant, contributing to anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis (RNA-seq) showed that inflammatory chemokine Csingle bondC motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) partially eliminated the protective effects of IFIT1 and promoted the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 by CCL5-p65NF-κB signaling pathway.

In this study, we aimed to examine the regulatory roles of Sirt3 in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mitochondrial damage in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). Sirt3 knockout mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS, and cultured TECs were stimulated with LPS to evaluate the effects of Sirt3 on mitochondrial structure and function in TECs. Electron microscopy was used to assess mitochondrial morphology. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect protein expression and examine mitochondrial morphology. Western blotting was used to quantify protein expression. We observed that LPS increased apoptosis, induced disturbances in mitochondrial function and dynamics, and downregulated Sirt3 expression in a sepsis-induced AKI mouse model and human proximal tubular (HK-2) cells in vitro. Sirt3 deficiency further exacerbated LPS-induced renal pathological damage, apoptosis and disturbances in mitochondrial function and dynamics. On the contrary, Sirt3 overexpression in HK-2 cells alleviated these lesions. Functional studies revealed that Sirt3 overexpression alleviated LPS-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in TECs by promoting OPA1-mediated mitochondrial fusion through the deacetylation of i-AAA protease (YME1L1), an upstream regulatory molecule of OPA1.

Baicalin exerts anti-inflammatory effects by the HMGB1/NLRP3/Casepase1 pathway. Abstract\nThe public health harms caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have become a global focus, with PM2.5 exposure recognized as a critical risk factor for global morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation is the common pathophysiological feature of respiratory diseases induced by PM2.5 and is the most critical cause of all these diseases. However, presently there is a lack of effective preventive and therapeutic approaches for inflammatory lung injuries caused by PM2.5 exposure. Baicalin is a herb-derived effective flavonoid compound with multiple health benefits. This study established a murine lung inflammatory injury model via inhalation of PM2.5 aerosols. The data showed that after baicalin intervention, lung injury pathological score of baicalin (4.16 ± 0.54, 3.33 ± 0.76, 4.00 ± 0.45) and claricid (3.00 ± 0.78) treatments were markedly lower than PM2.5-treated mice (6.17 ± 0.31), and pathological damage was alleviated. Compared to the PM2.5 group, the spleen and lung indexes in the baicalin and claricid groups were significantly reduced. The inflammatory cytokines of TNF-α, IL-18, and IL-1β in serum, alveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissue were significantly decreased in the baicalin and claricid groups. The expressions of inflammatory pathway-related genes and proteins HMGB1, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 were up-regulated in the PM2.5 group. The expressions of these genes and proteins were significantly decreased following baicalin treatment. The lung function indicators showed that the MV (65.94 ± 8.19 mL), sRaw (1.79 ± 0.08 cm H2O.s), and FRC (0.52 ± 0.01 mL) in the PM2.5 group were higher than in the control and baicalin groups, and respiratory function was improved by baicalin. PM2.5 exposure markedly altered the bacterial composition at the genus level. The dominant flora relative abundances of uncultured_bacterium_f_Muribaculaceae, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus, were decreased from the control group (9.20%, 8.53%, 6.21%) to PM2.5 group (6.26%, 5.49%, 4.77%), respectively. Following baicalin intervention, the relative abundances were 9.72%, 6.65%, and 3.57%, respectively. Therefore, baicalin could potentially prevent and improve mice lung inflammatory injury induced by PM2.5 exposure.

However, imbalanced cGAS-STING signaling tethers considerably in infectious, autoimmune, malignant, fibrotic, and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, multifaceted roles for cGAS-STING signaling at the cellular scale have emerged; these include autophagy, translation, metabolism homeostasis, cellular condensation, DNA damage repair, senescence, and cell death.

Collapse of microcirculation and tissue edema developed from the failure of endothelial barrier function in vital organ systems, including the lung, brain, and kidney, are detrimental, which often predict fatal outcomes. The host body possesses a substantial capacity for maintaining vascular homeostasis and repairing endothelial damage. Bone marrow and vascular wall niches house endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). In response to septic challenges, EPCs in their niche environment are rapidly activated for proliferation and angiogenic differentiation. In the meantime, release of EPCs from their niches into the blood stream and homing of these vascular precursors to tissue sites of injury are markedly increased. The recruited EPCs actively participate in host defense against endothelial injury and repair of damage in blood vasculature via direct differentiation into endothelial cells for re-endothelialization as well as production of vessel active mediators to exert paracrine and autocrine effects on angiogenesis/vasculogenesis. In recent years, investigations on significance of EPCs in host defense and molecular signaling mechanisms underlying regulation of the EPC response have achieved substantial progress, which promotes exploration of vascular precursor cell-based approaches for effective prevention and treatment of sepsis-induced vascular injury as well as vital organ system failure.\n\u0026lt; Back to Reviews Alternative to Homepage ","date":1669248000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669248000,"objectID":"4ab215cf04773780db9631dbab2f339c","permalink":"https://example.com/review/36436689/","publishdate":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/review/36436689/","section":"review","summary":"Abstract\nExtensive injury of endothelial cells in blood vasculature, especially in the microcirculatory system, frequently occurs in hosts suffering from sepsis and the accompanied systemic inflammation.

Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)–a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2.

Among the most divergent of the new enzymes identified, Casλ recognizes double-stranded DNA using a uniquely structured CRISPR RNA (crRNA). The Casλ-RNA-DNA structure determined by cryoelectron microscopy reveals a compact bilobed architecture capable of inducing genome editing in mammalian, Arabidopsis, and hexaploid wheat cells.

MYC proteins can also coordinate transcription with DNA replication and promote the repair of transcription-associated DNA damage, but how they exert these mechanistically diverse functions is unknown. Here we show that MYC dissociates from many of its binding sites in active promoters and forms multimeric, often sphere-like structures in response to perturbation of transcription elongation, mRNA splicing or inhibition of the proteasome. Multimerization is accompanied by a global change in the MYC interactome towards proteins involved in transcription termination and RNA processing. MYC multimers accumulate on chromatin immediately adjacent to stalled replication forks and surround FANCD2, ATR and BRCA1 proteins, which are located at stalled forks. MYC multimerization is triggered in a HUWE1 and ubiquitylation-dependent manner. At active promoters, MYC multimers block antisense transcription and stabilize FANCD2 association with chromatin.

SENP1 is progressively reduced in proportion to NASH severity in patients. Hepatocyte-specific SENP1-knockout mice develop spontaneous NASH-related phenotypes in a RIPK1 kinase-dependent manner. We demonstrate that SENP1 deficiency sensitizes cells to RIPK1 kinase-dependent apoptosis by promoting RIPK1 activation following TNFα stimulation. Mechanistically, SENP1 deSUMOylates RIPK1 in TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC), keeping RIPK1 in check.

Notably, genetic inhibition of RIPK1 effectively reverses disease progression in hepatocyte-specific SENP1-knockout male mice with high-fat-diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver.

In addition, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) also attenuated oxidative stress by reducing the formation of formation and the depletion of superoxide dismutase to treat an ALI (p \u0026lt; 0.05). To further explore the PGG-induced mechanism against an ALI, we screened the PGG pathway using immunohistochemical analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and Western blotting (WB). WB revealed that the expression levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (p-AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B phosphorylation (P-Akt), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) were significantly higher in the PGG group (60 and 30 mg/kg) than in the lipopolysaccharide group (p \u0026lt; 0.05); these findings were confirmed by the immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence results. Accordingly, PGG could be effective against an ALI by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress via AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling, allowing for the potential development of this as a natural drug against an ALI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1668902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668902400,"objectID":"bda9a2fa50b9e918f9619c08708dbe82","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36430900/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36430900/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nAn acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious lung disease with a high mortality rate, warranting the development of novel therapies.

Studying fruit fly eye discs and mouse livers, Kowalczyk et al. found instead that Hippo signaling does not instruct normal growth. The Hippo-induced overgrowth phenotypes appear to be caused by Hippo signaling activating abnormal genetic programs. These findings challenge a long-standing idea about the role of Hippo signaling in organ growth and suggest the need to re-evaluate our understanding of its function in other contexts, such as in cancer and regeneration.\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nAccurate growth control is fundamental to ensure proper organ size and animal health. Many signaling pathways can regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis, which in turn determine the size of an organ. However, mechanisms that can sense when a developing organ has reached its proper size and instruct the cessation of further growth remain elusive. Such mechanisms may also orchestrate regeneration and induce tumorigenesis when defective. In this context, the Hippo signaling pathway has attracted much attention, because experimental hyperactivation of its downstream effectors, the transcriptional coactivators Yap/Taz/Yki, can drive cell proliferation and cause substantial organ overgrowth and tumor development.\nRationale\nThe Hippo pathway integrates diverse biochemical and mechanical cell-cell and cell–extracellular matrix signals to regulate gene expression through Yap/Taz/Yki. In a current model of growth control, the activity of Yap/Taz/Yki directs the right amount of cell proliferation during development such that they are active when organs grow and inactivated when they stop growing. We reasoned that a signaling pathway functioning as a central regulator of organ growth should fulfil three requirements: (i) normal growth does not start or terminate properly without its input, (ii) its activity correlates with the spatial and temporal pattern of cell proliferation, and (iii) when hyperactivated, it produces larger but otherwise normal organs. We thus investigated whether the Hippo pathway fits these criteria for an organ growth control mechanism.\nResults\nTo address these hypotheses, we studied two commonly used models for organ growth control, the Drosophila eye and the mouse liver, in which we examined the effects of loss of Hippo signaling output on growth, its pattern of activity during normal development, and the genetic program induced by the experimental hyperactivation of Yap/Taz/Yki.\nOur data show that Hippo pathway output is not required for the developmental proliferation of liver precursor and Drosophila retinal cells. Furthermore, the transcriptional activity of Yap/Taz/Yki did not correlate with cell proliferation during development, and their experimental hyperactivation in hepatocytes and Drosophila retinal cells, which caused overgrowth, did not reactivate progenitor programs. Rather, Yap/Taz/Yki were active and required in specific cell types, namely Drosophila squamous peripodial epithelial cells and mouse cholangiocytes, and their hyperactivation induced aberrant gene expression profiles that partly resembled the normal programs of these cells. Finally, a functional screen in Drosophila identified several Hippo pathway target genes that were required for ectopic overgrowth but not for normal growth.\nConclusion\nOur data show that Hippo signaling does not instruct normal organ growth, and that the classic Hippo mutant overgrowth phenotypes represent Yap/Taz/Yki gain-of-function situations that involve ectopic expression of genes that are normally expressed in Hippo-dependent cell types. Cells that require endogenous Hippo pathway output, such as squamous cells, have in common being mechanically strained. Thus, Hippo signaling is involved in cellular responses to mechanical strain and in the differentiation and homeostasis of morphologically challenged cells. These findings correct a long-standing misconception about the role of Hippo signaling in organ growth and reveal the need to re-evaluate our understanding of its function in other contexts, such as in cancer and regeneration.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1668729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668729600,"objectID":"5463ee4df3c76ffbebbc83f051f946f6","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36395225/","publishdate":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36395225/","section":"article","summary":"Rethinking Hippo signaling\nMutations that cause dysregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway are known to cause excessive growth of organs, which has led many researchers to think of this pathway as a master regulator of organ growth.","tags":null,"title":"Hippo signaling instructs ectopic but not normal organ growth","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nDynamic alteration of the epitranscriptome exerts regulatory effects on the lifecycle of oncogenic viruses in vitro.

Ferroptosis inducers have shown considerable effectiveness in killing tumour cells in vitro, yet there has been no obvious success in experimental animal models, with the notable exception of immunodeficient mice. This suggests that the effect of ferroptosis on immune cells remains poorly understood. Pathologically activated neutrophils (PMNs), termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs), are major negative regulators of anti-tumour immunity. Here we found that PMN-MDSCs in the tumour microenvironment spontaneously die by ferroptosis. Although decreasing the presence of PMN-MDSCs, ferroptosis induces the release of oxygenated lipids and limits the activity of human and mouse T cells. In immunocompetent mice, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ferroptosis abrogates suppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs, reduces tumour progression and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade to suppress the tumour growth. By contrast, induction of ferroptosis in immunocompetent mice promotes tumour growth. Thus, ferroptosis is a unique and targetable immunosuppressive mechanism of PMN-MDSCs in the tumour microenvironment that can be pharmacologically modulated to limit tumour progression.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1668556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668556800,"objectID":"120f192fd5175cbeb1e6b63b57dd8ab8","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36385526/","publishdate":"2022-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36385526/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nFerroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of regulated cell death that is triggered by the discoordination of regulatory redox mechanisms culminating in massive peroxidation of polyunsaturated phospholipids.

We found that Ltbr knockout mice were more susceptible to Lyme disease spirochetes, suggesting the involvement of LTβR signaling in tick-borne Borrelia infection. Further investigation showed that a 15-kDa TSM protein from Ixodes persulcatus (I. persulcatus salivary protein; IpSAP) functioned as an immunosuppressant to facilitate the transmission and infection of Lyme disease spirochetes. IpSAP directly interacts with LTβR to block its activation, thus inhibiting the downstream signaling and consequently suppressing immunity. IpSAP immunization provided mice with significant protection against I. persulcatus-mediated Borrelia garinii infection. Notably, the immunization showed considerable cross-protection against other Borrelia infections mediated by other ixodid ticks. One of the IpSAP homologs from other ixodid ticks showed similar effects on Lyme spirochete transmission. Together, our findings suggest that LTβR signaling plays an important role in blocking the transmission and pathogenesis of tick-borne Lyme disease spirochetes, and that IpSAP and its homologs are promising candidates for broad-spectrum vaccine development.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1668556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668556800,"objectID":"b2763d37439c496b4aa75288bdce7140","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36383602/","publishdate":"2022-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36383602/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nLyme spirochetes have coevolved with ticks to optimize transmission to hosts using tick salivary molecules (TSMs) to counteract host defenses.

In this study, we aim to investigate whether melatonin modulates macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis via activating Apolipoprotein E/low-density lipoprotein receptor (ApoE/LDLR) pathway in influenza A-induced ALI. Here, wild-type (WT) and ApoE-/- mice were instilled intratracheally with influenza A (H3N2) and injected intraperitoneally with melatonin for 7 consecutive days. In vitro, WT and ApoE-/- murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were pretreated with melatonin before H3N2 stimulation. The results showed that melatonin administration significantly attenuated H3N2-induced pulmonary damage, leukocyte infiltration, and edema; decreased the expression of proinflammatory M1 markers; enhanced anti-inflammatory M2 markers; and switched the polarization of alveolar macrophages (AMs) from M1 to M2 phenotype. Additionally, melatonin inhibited reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) mediated pyroptosis shown by downregulation of malonaldehyde (MDA) and ROS levels as well as inhibition of the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Strikingly, the ApoE/LDLR pathway was activated when melatonin was applied in H3N2-infected macrophages and mice. ApoE knockout mostly abrogated the protective impacts of melatonin on H3N2-induced ALI and its regulatory ability on macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis. Furthermore, recombinant ApoE3 (re-ApoE3) inhibited H3N2-induced M1 polarization of BMDMs with upregulation of MT1 and MT2 expression, but re-ApoE2 and re-ApoE4 failed to do this. Melatonin combined with re-ApoE3 played more beneficial protective effects on modulating macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis in H3N2-infected ApoE-/- BMDMs. Our study indicated that melatonin attenuated influenza A- (H3N2-) induced ALI by inhibiting the M1 polarization of pulmonary macrophages and ROS-mediated pyroptosis via activating the ApoE/LDLR pathway.

Materials and methods: A CLP-induced sepsis rat model was established. The CLP rats were treated with a vehicle or Xuebijing via intravenous infusion and sacrificed at 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 h after CLP for lung tissue and blood sample collection. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was monitored. Transmission microscopy examination and H\u0026amp;E staining were performed to observe pulmonary structural alterations. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the plasma levels of epithelial markers, proinflammatory cytokines, and coagulation-related proteins. Results: Compared with vehicle treatment, Xuebijing administration maintained the MAP in the normal range until 11 h after CLP. Transmission microscopy and H\u0026amp;E staining revealed that Xuebijing administration alleviated alveolar–capillary barrier impairments and lung inflammation in CLP rats. ELISA showed that Xuebijing administration effectively reversed CLP-induced elevations in the plasma levels of epithelial markers endothelin-1 and von Willebrand factor, starting 6 and 8 h after CLP, respectively.

A characteristic hallmark of the response is the formation of sub-compartments around the site of damage, known as foci. Following multiple DNA breaks, the transcription factor p53 exhibits oscillations in its nuclear concentration, but how this dynamics can affect the repair remains unknown. Here, we formulate a theory for foci formation through droplet condensation and discover how oscillations in p53, with its specific periodicity and amplitude, optimize the repair process by preventing Ostwald ripening and distributing protein material in space and time. Based on the theory predictions, we reveal experimentally that the oscillatory dynamics of p53 does enhance the repair efficiency. These results connect the dynamical signaling of p53 with the microscopic repair process and create a new paradigm for the interplay of complex dynamics and phase transitions in biology.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1668038400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668038400,"objectID":"8981546c671e61c06728bc40c4d5ab60","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36368307/","publishdate":"2022-11-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36368307/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\np53 oscillations optimize DNA repair compared to cells with sustained levels Enhanced DNA repair efficiency may be achieved by suppression of Ostwald ripening Natural p53 periodicity and amplitude enable optimal distribution of repair material Oscillations enhance robustness of DNA damage response in stochastic environments Summary","tags":["DNA"],"title":"Enhanced DNA repair through droplet formation and p53 oscillations","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nExosomes are a subgroup of nanosized extracellular vesicles enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane and secreted by most eukaryotic cells.

In addition, several vaccines have been used to prevent the spread of the pandemic, such as adenovirus vector vaccines, inactivated vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. However, the efficacy of vaccines and the onset of adverse reactions vary among individuals. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are crucial regulators of viral infections and antiviral immune responses and are heavily involved in COVID-19 pathologies. During novel coronavirus infection, circRNAs not only directly affect the transcription process and interfere with viral replication but also indirectly regulate biological processes, including virus-host receptor binding and the immune response. Consequently, understanding the expression and function of circRNAs during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will provide novel insights into the development of circRNA-based methods.

Previous studies have demonstrated that XBF alleviates acute lung injury (ALI) by regulating macrophage-mediated immune inflammation, but the mechanisms of action remain elusive.\nPurpose\nThis study aimed to evaluate the lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of XBF and its underlying mechanisms.\nMethods\nHere, XBF’s effects were investigated in an ALI mouse model induced by inhalation of atomized lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Besides, the LPS-induced inflammation model in RAW264.7 cells was used to clarify the underlying mechanisms of XBF against ALI.\nResults\nOur results showed that XBF treatment alleviated LPS-induced lung injury, as evidenced by reduced histopathological changes, pulmonary alveoli permeability, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the lung tissues. In addition, inflammation was alleviated as shown by decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and reduced white blood cell (WBC) count in BALF. Furthermore, consistent with the in vivo assay, XBF inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines release and pro-inflammatory polarization in RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, XBF increased mitochondrial fusion by upregulating Mfn1 and attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by repressing Casp11, respectively, to inhibit NF-κB and MAPK pathways, thus repressing pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization.\nConclusion\nIn this study, we demonstrate that XBF exerts anti-ALI and -inflammatory effects by recovering mitochondrial dynamics and reducing inflammasome activation, providing a biological illustration of the clinical efficacy of XBF in treating COVID-19 patients.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1667952000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667952000,"objectID":"254d9a489b325d69f6a0bf48e065f728","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36423572/","publishdate":"2022-11-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36423572/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground\nXuanfei Baidu Formula (XBF) is an effective traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) remedy for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.

We utilized single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the immune response in bat lungs upon in vivo infection with a double-stranded RNA virus, Pteropine orthoreovirus PRV3M. Bat neutrophils were distinguished by high basal IDO1 expression. NK cells and T cells were the most abundant immune cells in lung tissue. Three distinct CD8+ effector T cell populations could be delineated by differential expression of KLRB1, GFRA2, and DPP4. Select NK and T clusters increased expression of genes involved in T cell activation and effector function early after viral infection. Alveolar macrophages and classical monocytes drove antiviral interferon signaling. Infection expanded a CSF1R+ population expressing collagen-like genes, which became the predominant myeloid cell type post-infection.

ATG9A is a lipid scramblase that allows equilibration of lipids across a membrane bilayer, whereas ATG2A facilitates lipid flow between tethered membranes. Although both have been functionally linked during the formation of autophagosomes, the molecular details and consequences of their interaction remain unclear. By combining data from peptide arrays, crosslinking, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry together with cryoelectron microscopy, we propose a molecular model of the ATG9A-2A complex. Using this integrative structure modeling approach, we identify several interfaces mediating ATG9A-2A interaction that would allow a direct transfer of lipids from ATG2A into the lipid-binding perpendicular branch of ATG9A.

Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that following IP administration, 1G3E5 was sustained at higher levels and for a longer period compared to IV administration. CCL8 expression in the lungs was not enhanced by LPS, but CCR2 and CCR5 receptors were significantly stimulated. 1G3E5-mediated inhibition of CCL8 was associated with the reduction of pulmonary inflammation and suppression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines.

However, it also impairs insulin signaling via its E3 ligase activity-mediated ubiquitination-dependent degradation of IR (insulin receptor) and IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) and its myokine function-induced allosteric blockage of IR. Here, we sought to develop MG53 into a cardioprotection therapy by separating its detrimental metabolic effects from beneficial actions.\nMethods: Using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, site-specific mutation, in vitro kinase assay, and in vivo animal studies, we investigated the role of MG53 phosphorylation at serine 255 (S255). In particular, utilizing recombinant proteins and gene knock-in approaches, we evaluated the potential therapeutic effect of MG53-S255A mutant in treating cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury in diabetic mice.\nResults: We identified S255 phosphorylation as a prerequisite for MG53 E3 ligase activity. Furthermore, MG53S255 phosphorylation was mediated by GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) and markedly elevated in the animal models with metabolic disorders. Thus, IR-IRS1-GSK3β-MG53 formed a vicious cycle in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders where aberrant insulin signaling led to hyper-activation of GSK3β, which in turn, phosphorylated MG53 and enhanced its E3 ligase activity, and further impaired insulin sensitivity. Importantly, S255A mutant eliminated the E3 ligase activity while retained cell protective function of MG53. Consequently, the S255A mutant, but not the wild type MG53, protected the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury in db/db mice with advanced diabetes, although both elicited cardioprotection in normal mice. Moreover, in S255A knock-in mice, S255A mutant also mitigated ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial damage in the diabetic setting.\nConclusions: S255 phosphorylation is a biased regulation of MG53 E3 ligase activity. The MG53-S255A mutant provides a promising approach for the treatment of acute myocardial injury, especially in patients with metabolic disorders.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1667779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667779200,"objectID":"c631ca08df7c7cf51254bc0019657340","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36337049/","publishdate":"2022-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36337049/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: As an integral component of cell membrane repair machinery, MG53 (mitsugumin 53) is important for cardioprotection induced by ischemia preconditioning and postconditioning.

However, whether and how intracellular EGFR is transported during endotoxemia have largely been unknown. Here, we show that LPS promotes high levels cell surface expression of EGFR in macrophages through two different transport mechanisms. On one hand, Rab10 is required for EEA1-mediated the membrane translocation of EGFR from the Golgi. On the other hand, EGFR phosphorylation prevents its endocytosis in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced membrane EGFR expression in LPS-activated macrophage. Mechanistically, upon LPS induced TLR4/EGFR phosphorylation, MAPK14 phosphorylated Rab7a at S72 impaired membrane receptor late endocytosis, which maintains EGFR membrane localization though blocking its lysosomal degradation. Meanwhile, Rab5a is also involved in the early endocytosis of EGFR. Subsequently, inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation switches M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype and alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury. Mechanistic study demonstrated that Erlotinib suppressed glycolysis-dependent M1 polarization via PKM2/HIF-1ɑ pathway and promoted M2 polarization through up-regulating PPARγ induced glutamine metabolism.

VCP is implicated in lysophagy via collaboration with specific cofactors in the ELDR complex. However, how the ELDR complex assembly is regulated has not been determined. Moreover, the functional significance of the penultimate and conserved Tyr805 phosphorylation in VCP has not been established. Here, we use an unbiased substrate trapping and mass spectrometry approach and identify VCP/p97 as a bona fide substrate of PTP4A2. Biochemical studies show that PTP4A2 dephosphorylates VCP at Tyr805, enabling the association of VCP with its C-terminal cofactors UBXN6/UBXD1 and PLAA, which are components of the ELDR complex responsible for lysophagy, the autophagic clearance of damaged lysosomes. Functionally, PTP4A2 is required for cellular homeostasis by promoting lysophagy through facilitating ELDR-mediated K48-linked ubiquitin conjugate removal and autophagosome formation on the damaged lysosomes. Deletion of Ptp4a2 in vivo compromises the recovery of glycerol-injection induced acute kidney injury due to impaired lysophagy and sustained lysosomal damage. Taken together, our data establish PTP4A2 as a critical regulator of VCP and uncover an important role for PTP4A2 in maintaining lysosomal homeostasis through dephosphorylation of VCP at Tyr805. Our study suggests that PTP4A2 targeting could be a potential therapeutic approach to treat cancers and other degenerative diseases by modulating lysosomal homeostasis and macroautophagy/autophagy.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1667779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667779200,"objectID":"81b344e57cdabd99314993498222e8cb","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36300783/","publishdate":"2022-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36300783/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nOverexpression of PTP4A phosphatases are associated with advanced cancers, but their biological functions are far from fully understood due to limited knowledge about their physiological substrates.

How these amino acids reach the intracellular ILC2 compartment is unknown. Here, we show that SLC7A8 is the key amino acid transporter in ILC2s. Slc7a8 deletion in lymphocytes reduced ILC2s and attenuated responses to helminth infection and house dust mite allergens.

Thus, SLC7A8 is a promising target for therapies aiming at attenuating immune inflammation in allergies and asthma.\nAbstract\nGroup 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are innate counterparts of T helper 2 (Th2) cells that maintain tissue homeostasis and respond to injuries through rapid interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13 secretion. ILC2s depend on availability of arginine and branched-chain amino acids for sustaining cellular fitness, proliferation, and cytokine secretion in both steady state and upon activation. However, the contribution of amino acid transporters to ILC2 functions is not known. Here, we found that ILC2s selectively express Slc7a8, encoding a transporter for arginine and large amino acids. Slc7a8 was expressed in ILC2s in a tissue-specific manner in steady state and was further increased upon activation. Genetic ablation of Slc7a8 in lymphocytes reduced the frequency of ILC2s, suppressed IL-5 and IL-13 production upon stimulation, and impaired type 2 immune responses to helminth infection. Consistent with this, Slc7a8-deficient ILC2s also failed to induce cytokine production and recruit eosinophils in a model of allergic lung inflammation. Mechanistically, reduced amino acid availability due to Slc7a8 deficiency led to compromised mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, as well as impaired activation of mammalian target of rapamycin and c-Myc signaling pathways. These findings identify Slc7a8 as a key supplier of amino acids for the metabolic programs underpinning fitness and activation of ILC2s.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1667779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667779200,"objectID":"f922ea0a4fb84fddf1ec09c982e89656","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36343258/","publishdate":"2022-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36343258/","section":"article","summary":"Significance\nMetabolic adaptations enable immune responses.

Genome-wide transcriptome profiling revealed a widespread impact of the Sam68/XRN2 complex on APA. XRN2 promotes recruitment of Sam68 to its target transcripts, where it competes with the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor for binding to strong polyadenylation signals at distal ends of genes, thus promoting usage of suboptimal proximal polyadenylation signals. This mechanism leads to 3′ untranslated region shortening and translation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in G1/S progression and proliferation.

These cells transiently express smooth muscle actin (Acta2) and are enriched with platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) expression. Genetic deletion of Ctnnb1 (gene coding for beta catenin) or Fgf10 in these cells using the Acta2-Cre-ERT2 driver line after injury (defined as NA-Tam condition; Tam refers to tamoxifen) led to impaired repair of the airway epithelium. In this study, we demonstrate that RSMCs are mostly captured using the Acta2-Cre-ERT2 driver when labeling occurs after (NA-Tam condition) rather than before injury (Tam-NA condition), and that their expansion occurs mostly between days 3 and 7 following NA treatment. Previous studies have shown that lineage-traced peribronchial GLI1+ cells are transiently amplified after NA injury. Here, we report that Gli1 expression is enriched in RSMCs. Using lineage tracing with Gli1Cre-ERT2 mice combined with genetic inactivation of Fgf10, we show that GLI1+ cells with Fgf10 deletion fail to amplify around the injured airways, thus resulting in impaired airway epithelial repair. Interestingly, Fgf10 expression is not upregulated in GLI1+ cells following NA treatment, suggesting that epithelial repair is mostly due to the increased number of Fgf10-expressing GLI1+ cells. Co-culture of SCGB1A1+ cells with GLI1+ cells isolated from non-injured or injured lungs showed that GLI1+ cells from these two conditions are similarly capable of supporting bronchiolar organoid (or bronchiolosphere) formation.

We generated two mouse models, one to stably mark CD103+ T cells (a marker of TRM cells) and the other to specifically deplete CD103- T cells. Using these models, we observed that intestinal CD103+ T cells became activated during viral or bacterial reinfection, remained organ-confined, and retained their original phenotype but failed to reexpand. Instead, the population was largely rejuvenated by CD103+ T cells formed de novo during reinfections. This pattern remained unchanged upon deletion of antigen-specific circulating T cells, indicating that the lack of expansion was not due to competition with circulating subsets. Thus, although intestinal CD103+ resident T cells survived long term without antigen, they lacked the ability of classical memory T cells to reexpand. This indicated that CD103+ T cell populations could not autonomously maintain themselves. Instead, their numbers were sustained during reinfection via de novo formation from CD103− precursors. Moreover, in contrast to CD103- cells, which require antigen plus inflammation for their activation, CD103+ TRM became fully activated follwing exposure to inflammation alone.

Here, we report that long-chain polyphosphates induced the release of CXCL4 from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages in a dose-/time-dependent fashion resulting from an induction of CXCL4 mRNA. This polyphosphate effect was lost after pre-incubation with recombinant exopolyphosphatase (PPX) Fc fusion protein, demonstrating the potency of long chains over monophosphates and ambient cations. In detail, polyphosphate chains \u0026gt;70 inorganic phosphate residues were required to reliably induce CXCL4. Polyphosphates acted independently of the purinergic P2Y1 receptor and the MyD88/TRIF adaptors of Toll-like receptors. On the other hand, polyphosphates augmented LPS/MyD88-induced CXCL4 release, which was explained by intracellular signaling convergence on PI3K/Akt. Polyphosphates induced Akt phosphorylation at threonine-308. Pharmacologic blockade of PI3K (wortmannin, LY294002) antagonized polyphosphate-induced CXCL4 release from macrophages. Intratracheal polyphosphate administration to C57BL/6J mice caused histologic signs of lung injury, disruption of the endothelial-epithelial barrier, influx of Ly6G+ polymorphonuclear neutrophils, depletion of CD11c+SiglecF+ alveolar macrophages, and release of CXCL4. Long-chain polyphosphates synergized with the complement anaphylatoxin, C5a, which was partly explained by upregulation of C5aR1 on myeloid cells. C5aR1-/- mice were protected from polyphosphate-induced lung injury. C5a generation occurred in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of polyphosphate-treated C57BL/6J mice.

In what media will the figure be shown? How does the resolution of the media compare to the resolution of my data? Do I have the time/energy/motivation to worry about black-and-white reproduction or readers with color blindness? Circos is a software package for visualizing data and information. It visualizes data in a circular layout — this makes Circos ideal for exploring relationships between objects or positions. There are other reasons why a circular layout is advantageous, not the least being the fact that it is attractive. Circos is ideal for creating publication-quality infographics and illustrations with a high data-to-ink ratio, richly layered data and pleasant symmetries. You have fine control each element in the figure to tailor its focus points and detail to your audience. Circos is flexible. Although originally designed for visualizing genomic data, it can create figures from data in any field—from genomics to visualizing migration to mathematical art. If you have data that describes relationships or multi-layered annotations of one or more scales, Circos is for you. Circos can be automated. It is controlled by plain-text configuration files, which makes it easily incorporated into data acquisition, analysis and reporting pipelines (a data pipeline is a multi-step process in which data is analyzed by multiple and typically independent tools, each passing their output as the input to the next step). Before download and install Circos, you need to understand the requirements. If you are a Windows user, read about pertinent differences between UNIX and Windows.

We investigated whether the BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related signaling pathways mediated the protective effects of ibrutinib on ALI.

We showed that both LPT1 and DFP treatment blocked the ferroptosis markers ACSL4 and ALOX15 in MAFLD mice. Furthermore, LPT1 treatment significantly reduced the liver levels of triglycerides and cholesterol, lipid peroxidation markers 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and ameliorated the expression of lipid synthesis/oxidation genes (Pparα, Scd1, Fasn, Hmgcr and Cpt1a), insulin resistance, mitochondrial ROS content and liver fibrosis. Importantly, LPT1 treatment potently inhibited hepatic apoptosis (Bax/Bcl-xL ratio and TUNEL+ cell number), pyroptosis (cleavages of Caspase-1 and GSDMD) and necroptosis (phosphorylation of MLKL). Moreover, LPT1 treatment markedly inhibited cleavages of PANoptosis-related caspase-8 and caspase-6 in MAFLD mouse liver. In an in vitro MAFLD model, treatment with LPT1 (100 nM) prevented cultured hepatocyte against cell death induced by pro-PANoptosis molecules (TNF-α, LPS and nigericin) upon lipid stress. On the contrary, DFP treatment only mildly attenuated hepatic inflammation but failed to alleviate lipid deposition, insulin resistance, apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis in MAFLD mice.

Abstract\nBackground and objective: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease which has high mortality and lacks effective pharmacological treatments. Excessive inflammation and oxidative stress are the key pathogenesis of ALI. Mefunidone (MFD), a novel small molecule compound, displayed anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress effects on streptozocin (STZ) and db/db mice in our previous studies.

MFD could also decreased proinflammatory cytokines release and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation stimulated by LPS. Further, MFD could significantly reduce LPS-induced phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), increase expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and restore the expressions of antioxidant enzymes.\nConclusion: Our results firstly supported that MFD effectively protected LPS-induced ALI against inflammation and oxidative stress through inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway and activating Nrf2 pathway.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1667347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667347200,"objectID":"351dfe82171cba4b004364c24042002d","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36334370/","publishdate":"2022-11-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36334370/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nMefunidone ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary edema and hyperemia.

A total of 2,006 high-confidence CASE with detailed functional axis were manually curated from 610 publications, involving 29 cancer primary sites and 60 human cancer subtypes. In addition, an interactive splicing visualization tool and a multiple-dimensional online splicing analysis toolkit were equipped to further explore the splicing events.\nCollectively, ASCancer Atlas provides the first knowledgebase of carcinogenic AS in human cancers, which can help users to investigate the full spectrum of splicing dysregulation in cancers and will become a value-added resource when more and more splicing variants are identified as targets for cancer treatment.\nAbstract\nAlternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental process that governs almost all aspects of cellular functions, and dysregulation in this process has been implicated in tumor initiation, progression and treatment resistance. With accumulating studies of carcinogenic mis-splicing in cancers, there is an urgent demand to integrate cancer-associated splicing changes to better understand their internal cross-talks and functional consequences from a global view. However, a resource of key functional AS events in human cancers is still lacking. To fill the gap, we developed ASCancer Atlas, a comprehensive knowledgebase of aberrant splicing in human cancers. Compared to extant databases, ASCancer Atlas features a high-confidence collection of 2006 cancer-associated splicing events experimentally proved to promote tumorigenesis, a systematic splicing regulatory network, and a suit of multi-scale online analysis tools. For each event, we manually curated the functional axis including upstream splicing regulators, splicing event annotations, downstream oncogenic effects, and possible therapeutic strategies. ASCancer Atlas also houses about 2 million computationally putative splicing events. Additionally, a user-friendly web interface was built to enable users to easily browse, search, visualize, analyze, and download all splicing events.

One reason is due to the lack of suitable animal models. We aimed to generate a cardiomyocyte (CM)-specific senescent animal model, uncover the underlying mechanisms, and develop new therapies for aging associated cardiac dysfunction.\nMethods: The gain/loss of circHIPK3 approach was used to explore the role of circHIPK3 in cardiomyocyte (CM) senescence. To investigate the mechanisms of circHIPK3 function in cardiac senescence, we generated CM-specific tamoxifen-induced circHIPK3 knockout (CKO) mice. We also applied various analyses including PCR, Western blot, nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction, immunofluorescence, echocardiography, RNA immunoprecipitation assay, RNA-pulldown assay, and co-immunoprecipitation.\nResults: Our novel CKO mice exhibited worse cardiac function, decreased circHIPK3 expression and telomere length shortening in the heart. The level of the senescence-inducer p21 in the hearts of CKO mice was significantly increased and survival was poor compared with control mice. In vitro, the level of p21 in CMs was significantly decreased by circHIPK3 overexpression, but increased by circHIPK3 silencing. We showed that circHIPK3 was a scaffold for p21 mRNA-binding protein HuR and E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP. circHIPK3 silencing weakened the interaction between HuR and β-TrCP, reduced HuR ubiquitination, and enhanced the interaction between HuR and p21 mRNA. Moreover, we found that mice injected with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (UMSC-Exos) showed increased circHIPK3 levels, decreased levels of p21, longer telomere length, and good cardiac function. However, these beneficial effects exerted by UMSC-Exos were inhibited by silencing circHIPK3.\nConclusions: We successfully generated CM-specific CKO mice for aging research. Our results showed that deletion of circHIPK3 led to exaggerated CM senescence and decreased cardiac function. As a scaffold, circHIPK3 enhanced the binding of E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP and HuR in the cytoplasm, leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of HuR and reduced p21 activity. In addition, UMSC-Exos exerted an anti-senescence and cardio-protective effect by delivering circHIPK3.

Epithelial cell cycle arrest in G2/M after injury is a key checkpoint for determining wound-healing leading to either normal cell proliferation or fibrosis. Here, we identify a kidney- and liver-enriched circular RNA, circBNC2, which is abundantly expressed in normal renal tubular cells and hepatocytes but significantly downregulated after acute ischemic or toxic insult. Loss of circBNC2 is at least partially mediated by upregulation of DHX9. Gain- and loss-of-function studies, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrate that circBNC2 acts as a negative regulator of cell G2/M arrest by encoding a protein that promotes formation of CDK1/cyclin B1 complexes. Restoring circBNC2 in experimentally-induced male mouse models of fibrotic kidney and liver, decreases G2/M arrested cell numbers with secretion of fibrotic factors, thereby mitigating extracellular matrix deposition and fibrosis. Decreased expression of circBNC2 and increased G2/M arrest of epithelial cells are recapitulated in human ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced chronic kidney disease and inflammation-induced liver fibrosis, highlighting the clinical relevance.

To address this, we used a transgenic mouse reporter for expression of Cxcl12, an arterial endothelial hallmark gene, and performed single-cell RNA sequencing on isolated Cxcl12-DsRed+ endothelium to assess cellular heterogeneity within pulmonary endothelium. Combining cell annotation with gene ontology and histological analysis allowed us to segregate the developing artery endothelium into functionally and spatially distinct subpopulations. Expression of Cxcl12 is highest in the distal arterial endothelial subpopulation, a compartment enriched in genes for vascular development.

Here, we exhaustively detect in-vivo translation of small open reading frames (small ORFs) within lncRNAs using Ribosomal profiling during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis. We show that around 30% of lncRNAs contain small ORFs engaged by ribosomes, leading to regulated translation of 100 to 300 micropeptides. We identify lncRNA features that favour translation, such as cistronicity, Kozak sequences, and conservation.

Our results expand the repertoire of lncRNA biochemical functions, and suggest that lncRNAs give rise to novel coding genes throughout evolution.

This process requires the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of SLC12 cation chloride transporters by WNK kinases, but how these kinases are activated by cell shrinkage remains unknown. Within seconds of cell exposure to hypertonicity, WNK1 concentrates into membraneless condensates, initiating a phosphorylation-dependent signal that drives net ion influx via the SLC12 cotransporters to restore cell volume. WNK1 condensate formation is driven by its intrinsically disordered C terminus, whose evolutionarily conserved signatures are necessary for efficient phase separation and volume recovery. This disorder-encoded phase behavior occurs within physiological constraints and is activated in vivo by molecular crowding rather than changes in cell size. This allows kinase activity despite an inhibitory ionic milieu and permits cell volume recovery through condensate-mediated signal amplification. Thus, WNK kinases are physiological crowding sensors that phase separate to coordinate a cell volume rescue response.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1667174400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667174400,"objectID":"4d0dd1a6e7beaf1c9db16871ae0632cb","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36318922/","publishdate":"2022-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36318922/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nEndogenous WNK1 forms hyperosmotic stress-induced condensates\nThe intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain mediates WNK1 phase separation\nPhase behavior of the WNK1 CTD is evolutionarily conserved despite sequence divergence\nWNK1 is a molecular crowding sensor and mediator of regulatory volume increase","tags":["Phase Separation"],"title":"WNK kinases sense molecular crowding and rescue cell volume via phase separation","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nCommunicable respiratory viral infections pose both epidemic and pandemic threats and broad-spectrum antiviral strategies could improve preparedness for these events. To discover host antiviral restriction factors that may act as suitable targets for the development of host-directed antiviral therapies, we here conduct a whole-genome CRISPR activation screen with influenza B virus (IBV). A top hit from our screen, beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase 1 (B3GAT1), effectively blocks IBV infection. Subsequent studies reveal that B3GAT1 activity prevents cell surface sialic acid expression. Due to this mechanism of action, B3GAT1 expression broadly restricts infection with viruses that require sialic acid for entry, including Victoria and Yamagata lineage IBVs, H1N1/H3N2 influenza A viruses (IAVs), and the unrelated enterovirus D68. To understand the potential utility of B3GAT1 induction as an antiviral strategy in vivo, we specifically express B3GAT1 in the murine respiratory epithelium and find that overexpression is not only well-tolerated, but also protects female mice from a lethal viral challenge with multiple influenza viruses, including a pandemic-like H1N1 IAV.

Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are promising nanotherapeutic agents that have the potential to repair the BBB after ischemic stroke; however, whether they can attenuate BBB disruption and hemorrhagic transformation after tPA thrombolysis is largely unknown. Here, we observed that MSC-EVs efficiently passed through the BBB and selectively accumulated in injured brain regions in ischemic stroke model mice in real time using aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), which exhibit better tracking ability than the commercially available tracer DiR. Moreover, tPA administration promoted the homing of MSC-EVs to the ischemic brain and increased the uptake of MSC-EVs by astrocytes. Furthermore, the accumulated MSC-EVs attenuated the tPA-induced disruption of BBB integrity and alleviated hemorrhage by inhibiting astrocyte activation and inflammation. Mechanistically, miR-125b-5p delivered by MSC-EVs played an indispensable role in maintaining BBB integrity by targeting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and inhibiting nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling in astrocytes. This study provides a noninvasive method for real-time tracking of MSC-EVs in the ischemic brain after tPA treatment and highlights the potential of MSC-EVs as thrombolytic adjuvants for ischemic stroke.

MSC-EVs inhibit astrocyte activation and associated inflammation through miR-125b-5p/TLR4/NF-κB pathway.

Here, we performed the largest integrative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics analysis reported to date for a cohort of 200 PitNET patients.

Further analysis identified potential therapeutic targets, including CDK6, TWIST1, EGFR, and VEGFR2, for different clusters. Immune subtyping to explore the potential for application of immunotherapy in PitNET identified an association between alterations in the JAK1-STAT1-PDL1 axis and immune exhaustion, and between changes in the JAK3-STAT6-FOS/JUN axis and immune infiltration. These identified molecular markers and alternations in various clusters/subtypes were further confirmed in an independent cohort of 750 PitNET patients.

Paused RNAPII can be released into productive elongation by the kinase P-TEFb or targeted for premature termination by the Integrator complex. Integrator comprises endonuclease and phosphatase activities, driving termination by cleavage of nascent RNA and removal of stimulatory phosphorylation. We generated a degron system for rapid Integrator endonuclease (INTS11) depletion to probe the direct consequences of Integrator-mediated RNA cleavage. Degradation of INTS11 elicits nearly universal increases in active early elongation complexes. However, these RNAPII complexes fail to achieve optimal elongation rates and exhibit persistent Integrator phosphatase activity. Thus, only short transcripts are significantly upregulated following INTS11 loss, including transcription factors, signaling regulators, and non-coding RNAs.

Nd2O3 increases H19 and TNFRSF1A levels, decreases miR-29a-3p levels, and activates the NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells and mice. H19 via miR-29a-3p-regulated TNFRSF1A is involved in Nd2O3-induced lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. The study provide a tool for assessing lung injury risk of Nd2O3 and other environmental factors that induce inflammatory response and pulmonary fibrosis-associated lncRNAs. Abstract\nThe occupational and environmental health safety of rare earths has attracted considerable attention. In China, the rare earth neodymium oxide (Nd2O3) is extensively refined and utilized. However, the mechanisms of Nd2O3-induced lung injury are elusive. In the present study, we found that exposure of mice to Nd2O3 caused an inflammatory reaction and fibrosis in lung tissues, which was in relation to the Nd2O3-induced higher levels of the lncRNA H19 (H19), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFRSF1A), p-p65, and p-IKKβ and lower levels of miR-29a-3p. Further, in mouse monocyte macrophage leukemia cells (RAW264.7), Nd2O3 induced an inflammatory reaction, increases of H19 and TNFRSF1A levels, decreases of miR-29a-3p levels, and activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway. Further, we established that miR-29a-3p regulates TNFRSF1A expression. Up-regulation of miR-29a-3p and down-regulation of H19 blocked the Nd2O3-induced secretion of TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-6; the increases of TNFRSF1A levels; and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells. Further, in Nd2O3-treated RAW26.4 cells, H19 inhibited the expression of miR-29a-3p, which targets TNFRSF1A, and activated the NF-κB signaling pathway to enhance the expression of TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-6. Moreover, for mice, up-regulation of miR-29a-3p reversed lung tissue inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway induced by Nd2O3. In sum, the present investigation shows that H19 via miR-29a-3p is involved in lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis induced by Nd2O3, which is a mechanism for the Nd2O3-induced lung inflammatory response and pulmonary fibrosis.

However, single drug treatment has limited efficacy and delivery efficiency. Bioengineering can improve the limited effect of single drugs by combining drugs and materials to obtain complementary or cooperative bioengineered drugs. In this study, gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and silk fibroin glycidyl methacrylate (SFMA) were used to synthesize GelMA/SFMA composite hydrogels with suitable mechanical properties, swelling ratio and biodegradability. The composite hydrogel was used as a wound dressing for sustained drug release. RES was loaded into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) to synthesize MSN-RES to enhance the release dynamic, and MSN-RES and PDEVs were combined with the composite hydrogels to form GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels. The GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs had low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility, inhibited macrophage iNOS expression, and promoted the tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. In a diabetic mouse wound model, the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α and iNOS, increased the expression of anti-inflammatory factors TGF-β1 and Arg-1, promoted angiogenesis, and accelerated wound healing.

Conversely, knockdown or knockout of endogenous Dicer leads to up-regulation of p53-mediated transcriptional activation without increasing its protein levels. Moreover, Dicer-mediated repression is independent of its intrinsic endoribonuclease activity; instead, Dicer directly represses transcription by recruiting the SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase.

Although DCLK1’s regulatory effect on the tumor immune microenvironment has been hypothesized, its mode of action has not been shown previously in vivo, which hampers the potential intervention based on this molecule for clinical practice.\nMethods\nTo define the immunomodulatory mechanisms of DCLK1 in vivo, we generated DCLK1-/- tumor cells by Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) and developed subcutaneous and intestinal orthotopic transplantation tumor models. Tumor tissues were harvested and subjected to immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations, tumor myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) sorting by isolation kit and then co-culture with spleen T cells, and RNA sequencing for transcriptomic analysis.\nResults\nWe found that DCLK1-/- tumor cells lose their tumorigenicity under immune surveillance. Failed tumor establishment of DCLK1-/- was associated with an increase in infiltration of CD8+ T cells and effector CD4+ T cells, and reduced numbers of MDSCs in the tumor tissue. Furthermore, DCLK1 promoted the up-regulation of C-X-C motif ligand 1, which recruits MDSCs in CRC through chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 2.

Methods for controlling protein synthesis in the kidney are limited. Reversing translation shutdown requires dephosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) subunit eIF2α; this is mediated by a key regulatory molecule, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A (Ppp1r15a), also known as GADD34.\nMethods: To study protein synthesis in the kidney in a murine endotoxemia model and investigate the feasibility of translation control in vivo by boosting the protein expression of Ppp1r15a, we combined multiple tools, including ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), proteomics, polyribosome profiling, and antisense oligonucleotides, and a newly generated Ppp1r15a knock-in mouse model and multiple mutant cell lines.\nResults: We report that translation shutdown in established sepsis-induced kidney injury is brought about by excessive eIF2α phosphorylation and sustained by blunted expression of the counter-regulatory phosphatase Ppp1r15a. We determined the blunted Ppp1r15a expression persists because of the presence of an upstream open reading frame (uORF). Overcoming this barrier with genetic and antisense oligonucleotide approaches enabled the overexpression of Ppp1r15a, which salvaged translation and improved kidney function in an endotoxemia model. Loss of this uORF also had broad effects on the composition and phosphorylation status of the immunopeptidome-peptides associated with the MHC-that extended beyond the eIF2α axis.\nConclusions: We found Ppp1r15a is translationally repressed during late-phase sepsis because of the existence of an uORF, which is a prime therapeutic candidate for this strategic rescue of translation in late-phase sepsis.

Here, we report that activated STING could be transferred between cells to promote antitumor immunity, a process triggered by RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagy. Mechanistically, RAB22A engages PI4K2A to generate PI4P that recruits the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L1 complex, inducing the formation of ER-derived RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagosome, in which STING activated by agonists or chemoradiotherapy is packaged. This RAB22A-induced autophagosome fuses with RAB22A-positive early endosome, generating a new organelle that we name Rafeesome (RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagosome fused with early endosome). Meanwhile, RAB22A inactivates RAB7 to suppress the fusion of Rafeesome with lysosome, thereby enabling the secretion of the inner vesicle of the autophagosome bearing activated STING as a new type of extracellular vesicle that we define as R-EV (RAB22A-induced extracellular vesicle). Activated STING-containing R-EVs induce IFNβ release from recipient cells to the tumor microenvironment, promoting antitumor immunity. Consistently, RAB22A enhances the antitumor effect of the STING agonist diABZI in mice, and a high RAB22A level predicts good survival in nasopharyngeal cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. Our findings reveal that Rafeesome regulates the intercellular transfer of activated STING to trigger and spread antitumor immunity, and that the inner vesicle of non-canonical autophagosome originated from ER is secreted as R-EV, providing a new perspective for understanding the intercellular communication of organelle membrane proteins.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"e9634128a4acdb0d5e77396afb4f1e97","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36280710/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36280710/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nSTING, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein, mediates innate immune activation upon cGAMP stimulation and is degraded through autophagy.

To fill this gap, we have manually curated a database of EV-DNA data derived from human biofluids (liquid biopsy) and in-vitro studies, called the Extracellular Vesicle-Associated DNA Database (EV-ADD). This database contains validated experimental details and data extracted from peer-reviewed published literature. It can be easily queried to search for EV isolation methods and characterization, EV-DNA isolation techniques, quality validation, DNA fragment size, volume of starting material, gene names and disease context. Currently, our database contains samples representing 23 diseases, with 13 different types of EV isolation techniques applied on eight different human biofluids (e.g. blood, saliva). In addition, EV-ADD encompasses EV-DNA data both representing the whole genome and specifically including oncogenes, such as KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, MYC, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). An EV-ADD data metric system was also integrated to assign a compliancy score to the MISEV guidelines based on experimental parameters reported in each study. While currently available databases document the presence of proteins, lipids, RNA and metabolites in EVs (e.g. Vesiclepedia, ExoCarta, ExoBCD, EVpedia, and EV-TRACK), to the best of our knowledge, EV-ADD is the first of its kind to compile all available EV-DNA datasets derived from human biofluid samples. We believe that this database provides an important reference resource on EV-DNA-based liquid biopsy research, serving as a learning tool and to showcase the latest developments in the EV-DNA field. EV-ADD will be updated yearly as newly published EV-DNA data becomes available.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1666396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666396800,"objectID":"f736cfc3dcada9483e6657279da127d3","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36271888/","publishdate":"2022-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36271888/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) play a key role in cellular communication both in physiological conditions and in pathologies such as cancer.

Acute lung injury (ALI) appears the earliest, with urgent onset and limited treatments. Previous pharmacological studies have found that rhein (RH), an active ingredient rich in rhubarb, has multiple pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-infection and metabolic regulation. This research aimed to explore whether RH alleviates septic acute lung injury and probe possible mechanisms.\nMain methods: In this study, the septic ALI mouse model was established by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). LPS-induced RAW264.7 model was selected to further explore the protective mechanism of RH. H\u0026amp;E staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR, and 1H NMR analysis were used to verify the protective effect of RH on ALI in vivo and in vitro.\nKey findings: RH could relieve pathological lung injury and pulmonary edema, reduce the serum LPS and inhibit inflammatory response in CLP mice. Further studies displayed that RH affected the metabolism in vivo, with significant changes in serum and lung metabolomics. In vitro results demonstrated that RH inhibited the expression of inflammatory mediators and factors in macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming and upregulating the expression of Sirtuin 1.\nSignificance: RH improved the overall metabolic condition of sepsis mice by up-regulating and activating SIRT1, and inhibited the over activation of macrophages by regulating metabolism.

Previously, pentapeptide bursopentin (BP5, Cys-Lys-Arg-Val-Tyr) was reported to possess significant antioxidant activity and inhibit lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced NF-κB activation in vitro, whereas little is known about its effects in vivo. In this study, we explored the effects of BP5 on endotoxemia-induced ALI in mice and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our studies revealed that BP5 markedly improved survival and effectively alleviated lung injury by reducing overoxidation and excessive inflammatory response in endotoxemia mice. In LPS-stimulated mouse primary macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells, BP5 also exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties by enhancing Nrf2 activation. Importantly, these beneficial effects were abolished by Nrf2 knockdown. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we performed localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) assays, molecular docking, together with cell-based studies, and found that BP5 inhibited the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction to promote Nrf2 nuclear translocation and activation. Moreover, BP5-induced Nrf2 activation was shown to be accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt (at Ser473) and GSK3β (at Ser9), and a decrease in Fyn nuclear accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacologically inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β obviously enhanced Fyn nuclear accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells, which partially attenuated the promoting effect of BP5 on Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and activation. Furthermore, In Nrf2-/- mice, the protective effects of BP5 on the endotoxemia-induced ALI in WT mice were largely vanished. Our findings indicated that BP5 effectively protected endotoxemia-induced ALI against oxidative stress and inflammatory response, which are largely dependent on activation of the Nrf2 pathway.

Abstract\nSepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction with devastating consequences, prominent among which is lung damage. Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, is able to alleviate acute lung injury (ALI). Nitric oxide (NO) suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. MN-08, a novel nitrate derivative of memantine, possesses both the ability to antagonize NMDAR and release NO. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of MN-08 against LPS-induced systemic inflammation and septic lung injury in mice, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of MN-08 in LPS-induced mice and THP-1 macrophages. MN-08 significantly increased the survival rate of septic mice, alleviated LPS-induced sepsis in mice via improving systemic inflammatory response syndrome and immune dysfunction, and attenuated pulmonary injury and inflammatory infiltration. More importantly, the therapeutic benefit of MN-08 for sepsis was greater than that of memantine and dexamethasone. Mechanistically, MN-08 exerted anti-inflammatory activity through inhibiting nuclear translocation of NF-κB, activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and the signaling transduction of STAT3/NF-κB. In addition, MN-08 suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Abstract\nZIP8 (SLC39A8) is a transmembrane divalent metal ion importer that is most highly expressed in the lung and is inducible by inflammatory stimuli. In addition to zinc and manganese, ZIP8 can transport iron but its specific roles in iron regulation during homeostatic and pathologic processes remain poorly understood. Using a novel global inducible ZIP8 knockout (KO) mouse, we analyzed the role of ZIP8 in steady-state iron homeostasis and during inflammation and infection. We observed an unexpected phenotype of elevated spleen iron levels and decreased serum iron in ZIP8 KO mice, suggesting that ZIP8 plays a role in iron recycling. We also showed that ZIP8 is expressed on lung distal airspace epithelial cells and transports iron from the airway into lung tissue. LPS-induced inflammation induced ZIP8 expression in the lung, but ZIP8 deletion had no detrimental effect on the severity of LPS-induced acute lung injury or on the outcomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection. Thus, ZIP8 plays a role in systemic iron homeostasis but does not modulate the severity of inflammatory lung injury or the host defense against a common bacterial cause of pneumonia.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1666137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666137600,"objectID":"9aa1e0b914a2f8a0a3be79ad485fe303","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36260707/","publishdate":"2022-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36260707/","section":"article","summary":"Key Points\nZIP8 knockout mice have elevated spleen iron levels and relative hypoferremia, suggesting that ZIP8 plays a role in iron recycling.

Precise regulation of STING is essential to ensure balanced immune responses and prevent detrimental autoinflammation. After activation, STING, a transmembrane protein, traffics from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where its phosphorylation by the protein kinase TBK1 enables signal transduction. The mechanism that ends STING signalling at the Golgi remains unknown. Here we show that adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) controls the termination of STING-dependent immune activation. We find that AP-1 sorts phosphorylated STING into clathrin-coated transport vesicles for delivery to the endolysosomal system, where STING is degraded. We identify a highly conserved dileucine motif in the cytosolic C-terminal tail (CTT) of STING that, together with TBK1-dependent CTT phosphorylation, dictates the AP-1 engagement of STING. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of AP-1 in complex with phosphorylated STING explains the enhanced recognition of TBK1-activated STING. We show that suppression of AP-1 exacerbates STING-induced immune responses.

Abstract\nAcute lung injury (ALI), a clinical syndrome of acute respiratory failure due to acute lung inflammation, remains a substantial public health problem in the worldwide. Ligusticum Chuanxiong Rhizoma and Angelicae Sinensis Radix was herb-pair of the traditional Chinese medicine. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that volatile oil extracted from Chuanxiong Rhizome and Angelicae Sinensis Radix is identified as an important active ingredient, which has good antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, whether their volatile oil combination (CA-VO), has effects on the prevention and treatment of ALI has not been reported yet. Due to poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability of CA-VO, CA -VO-loaded microemulsion (CA-VO-ME) was formulated to enhance its oral bioavailability. The physical properties of CA-VO-ME were characterized. The pharmacokinetic parameters and the effect on ALI were evaluated. The particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of CA-VO-ME were 20.19 ± 0.08 nm, 0.091 ± 0.01, 36.33 ± 4.29%, and 93.75%, respectively.

Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by the lethal accumulation of iron and lipid peroxidation, which is associated with many diseases. Our study addressed the potential role played by ferroptosis and iron accumulation in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. We found that the inducers of pulmonary fibrosis and injury, namely, bleomycin (BLM) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induced ferroptosis of lung epithelial cells. Both the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1) and the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) alleviated the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin or LPS. TGF-β stimulation upregulated the expression of transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC) in the human lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) and mouse primary lung fibroblasts, resulting in increased intracellular Fe2+, which promoted the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Mechanistically, TGF-β enhanced the expression and nuclear localization of the transcriptional coactivator tafazzin (TAZ), which combined with the transcription factor TEA domain protein (TEAD)-4 to promote the transcription of TFRC. In addition, elevated Fe2+ failed to induce the ferroptosis of fibroblasts, which might be related to the regulation of iron export and lipid metabolism.

The influence of both adaptive and innate immune responses on the therapeutic outcomes of HER2+BC patients has been extensively demonstrated.\nMethods: Long non-coding RNAs expressed in non-pathological complete response (pCR) HER2 positive BC were screened and validated by RNA-seq. Survival analysis were made by Kaplan-Meier method. Cell death assay and proliferation assay were performed to confirm the phenotype of LINC00624. RT-qPCR and western blot were used to assay the IFN response. Xenograft mouse model were used for in vivo confirmation of anti-neu treatment resistance. RNA pull-down and immunoblot were used to confirm the interaction of ADAR1 and LINC00624. ADAR1 recombinant protein were purified from baculovirus expression system. B16-OVA cells were used to study antigen presentation both in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometry was used to determine the tumor infiltrated immune cells of xenograft model. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were used for in vivo treatment.\nResults: In this study, we found that LINC00624 blocked the antitumor effect of HER2- targeted therapy both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting type I interferon (IFN) pathway activation. The double-stranded RNA-like structure of LINC00624 can bind and be edited by the adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA-editing enzyme adenosine deaminase RNA specific 1 (ADAR1), and this editing has been shown to release the growth inhibition and attenuate the innate immune response caused by the IFN response. Notably, LINC00624 promoted the stabilization of ADAR1 by inhibiting its ubiquitination-induced degradation triggered by β-TrCP. In contrast, LINC00624 inhibited major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation and limited CD8+T cell infiltration in the cancer microenvironment, resulting in immune checkpoint blockade inhibition and anti-HER2 treatment resistance mediated through ADAR1.\nConclusions: In summary, these results suggest that LINC00624 is a cancer immunosuppressive lncRNA and targeting LINC00624 through ASOs in tumors expressing high levels of LINC00624 has great therapeutic potential in future clinical applications.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1665964800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665964800,"objectID":"6a321228a2d01c2c0119734e50812c49","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36252997/","publishdate":"2022-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36252997/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Despite the success of HER2-targeted therapy in achieving prolonged survival in approximately 50% of treated individuals, treatment resistance is still an important challenge for HER2+ breast cancer (BC) patients.","tags":["RNA","non-coding RNAs","Immunology","Cancers","Immunosuppression","Breast","Obstetrics \u0026 Gynaecology","lncRNAs"],"title":"Immunosuppressive lncRNA LINC00624 promotes tumor progression and therapy resistance through ADAR1 stabilization","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical disease with high morbidity and mortality, and with a lack of effective drugs for treatment.

Mechanistically, depletion of the m5C methyltransferase decreases the host RNA m5C methylome and enhances polymerase III–transcribed noncoding RNAs that are recognized by RIG-I to trigger enhanced type I IFN signaling. Our study reveals a role of m5C in regulating innate immunity and highlights m5C as a new target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics.\nAbstract\n5-methylcytosine (m5C) is one of the most prevalent modifications of RNA, playing important roles in RNA metabolism, nuclear export, and translation. However, the potential role of RNA m5C methylation in innate immunity remains elusive. Here, we show that depletion of NSUN2, an m5C methyltransferase, significantly inhibits the replication and gene expression of a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses. Notably, we found that this antiviral effect is largely driven by an enhanced type I interferon (IFN) response. The antiviral signaling pathway is dependent on the cytosolic RNA sensor RIG-I but not MDA5. Transcriptome-wide mapping of m5C following NSUN2 depletion in human A549 cells revealed a marked reduction in the m5C methylation of several abundant noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). However, m5C methylation of viral RNA was not noticeably altered by NSUN2 depletion. In NSUN2-depleted cells, the host RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcribed ncRNAs, in particular RPPH1 and 7SL RNAs, were substantially up-regulated, leading to an increase of unshielded 7SL RNA in cytoplasm, which served as a direct ligand for the RIG-I-mediated IFN response. In NSUN2-depleted cells, inhibition of Pol III transcription or silencing of RPPH1 and 7SL RNA dampened IFN signaling, partially rescuing viral replication and gene expression. Finally, depletion of NSUN2 in an ex vivo human lung model and a mouse model inhibits viral replication and reduces pathogenesis, which is accompanied by enhanced type I IFN responses.

Here we identify the known protein phosphatase PtpB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a phospholipid phosphatase inhibiting the host inflammasome-pyroptosis pathway. Mechanistically, PtpB dephosphorylated phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate in host cell membrane, thus disrupting the membrane localization of the cleaved GSDMD to inhibit cytokine release and pyroptosis of macrophages. Notably, this phosphatase activity requires PtpB binding to ubiquitin. Disrupting phospholipid phosphatase activity or the ubiquitin-interacting motif of PtpB enhanced host GSDMD-dependent immune responses and reduced intracellular pathogen survival. Thus, pathogens inhibit pyroptosis and counteract host immunity by altering host membrane composition.\nIntroduction\nPyroptosis is a proinflammatory form of programmed cell death characterized by membrane pore formation that allows the release of intracellular inflammatory mediators, a process that is elicited by the inflammasome-mediated cleavage and activation of gasdermin D (GSDMD). Growing evidence supports a critical role for pyroptosis in the control of infections by mammalian hosts, but how pathogens evade this immune response remains largely unexplored.\nRationale\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), an ancient pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB), has developed numerous intracellular survival strategies to evade host immunity and to drive the occurrence and development of TB. One notable feature evolved by Mtb is a set of eukaryotic-like effectors, but their host targets and regulatory roles in pathogen–host interactions remain largely unclear. In this study, we sought to identify the key pathogenic regulators of inflammasome-pyroptosis pathways from Mtb eukaryotic-like effectors, information that could improve our understanding of TB pathogenesis and provide potential targets for novel anti-TB treatment.\nResults\nWe examined the whole genome of Mtb to predict its secreted eukaryotic-like proteins possessing eukaryotic-like motifs or domains that might target host factors directly. These Mtb effector proteins were then subjected to further experimental analyses using an inflammasome reconstitution system for screening inhibitors of inflammasome-pyroptosis pathways. Out of 201 predicted Mtb-secreted eukaryotic proteins, six Mtb proteins (Rv0153c, Rv0561c, Rv0824c, Rv0861c, Rv1515c, and Rv1679) exhibited strong inhibitory effects on both NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome pathways. Among these proteins, PtpB (i.e., Rv0153c) was most abundantly secreted by Mtb during infection. We thus focused on PtpB and further confirmed its inhibitory effect on AIM2 or NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that PtpB inhibited gasdermin D (GSDMD)–dependent cytokine release and pyroptosis to promote Mtb intracellular survival in macrophages. Mechanistically, Mtb-secreted PtpB could target and dephosphorylate host plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] to inhibit the membrane localization of the N-terminal cleavage fragment of GSDMD (GSDMD-N), thus preventing GSDMD-mediated immune responses. This phosphoinositide phosphatase activity requires binding of PtpB to ubiquitin. Accordingly, disrupting phospholipid phosphatase activity or the unusual ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)–like domain of PtpB markedly enhanced host innate immune responses and reduced intracellular pathogen survival in mice in a GSDMD-dependent manner.\nConclusion\nWe demonstrate that GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release play a critical role in host anti-infection immunity, which is counteracted by Mtb effector protein PtpB. Our data reveal a role of the pathogen-derived phospholipid phosphatase in the regulation of GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis and cytokine releases, extending our understanding of the elaborate regulatory mechanism of cellular inflammasome-pyroptosis signaling pathways during pathogen infection.

Astaxanthin alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ferroptosis. Astaxanthin attenuates ferroptosis against lps-induced acute lung injury by Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Abstract\nFerroptosis is a form of regulated nonapoptotic cell death associated with iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Previous studies have shown that ferroptosis is involved in the occurrence and development of acute lung injury (ALI). In this study, a systems pharmacology approach was performed through the overall process of target acquisition, network construction, and further analysis. Then, the effects of astaxanthin on LPS-induced inflammation and ferroptosis were investigated in RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS in vitro and ALI mice induced by LPS in vivo. The enrichment analysis of astaxanthin-target gene is closely related to the occurrence and development mechanism of ferroptosis. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of astaxanthin acting on ALI found that these intersection genes are associated with ALI inflammatory pathway. In addition, astaxanthin can effectively inhibit LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ferroptosis in RAW264.7 cells. Consistently, administration of astaxanthin protected mice against LPS-induced ALI and significantly decreased the extent of lung edema, inflammatory cells infiltration, and ferroptosis in vivo, and Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is involved in astaxanthin inhibits LPS-induced ALI and ferroptosis.

Overexpression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1), an enzyme degrading ADMA, exerts protective effects in animal models. However, the impact of DDAH1/ADMA on PM2.5-induced lung injury has not been investigated.\nMethods: Ddah1-/- and DDAH1-transgenic mice, as well as their respective wild-type (WT) littermates, were exposed to either filtered air or airborne PM2.5 (mean daily concentration ~ 50 µg/m3) for 6 months through a whole-body exposure system. Mice were also acutely exposed to 10 mg/kg PM2.5 and/or exogenous ADMA (2 mg/kg) via intratracheal instillation every other day for 2 weeks. Inflammatory response, oxidative stress and related gene expressions in the lungs were examined. In addition, RAW264.7 cells were exposed to PM2.5 and/or ADMA and the changes in intracellular oxidative stress and inflammatory response were determined.\nResults: Ddah1-/- mice developed more severe lung injury than WT mice after long-term PM2.5 exposure, which was associated with greater induction of pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation. In the lungs of PM2.5-exposed mice, Ddah1 deficiency increased protein expression of p-p65, iNOS and Bax, and decreased protein expression of Bcl-2, SOD1 and peroxiredoxin 4. Conversely, DDAH1 overexpression significantly alleviated lung injury, attenuated pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation, and exerted opposite effects on those proteins in PM2.5-exposed mice. In addition, exogenous ADMA administration could mimic the effect of Ddah1 deficiency on PM2.5-induced lung injury, oxidative stress and inflammation. In PM2.5-exposed macrophages, ADMA aggravated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in an iNOS-dependent manner.\nConclusion: Our data revealed that DDAH1 has a marked protective effect on long-term PM2.5 exposure-induced lung injury.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1665705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665705600,"objectID":"ab3dd8f1284422d6300925cf76bf7faf","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36242005/","publishdate":"2022-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36242005/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Airborne fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) pollution is associated with the prevalence of respiratory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Pro-inflammatory M1 alveolar macrophages are an interesting target for treating inflammatory and infectious pulmonary diseases. One commune targeting strategy is to use nanoparticles conjugated with hyaluronic acid, which interact with CD44 overexpressed on the membrane of those cells. Unfortunately, this coating strategy may be countered by the presence on the surface of the nanoparticles of a poly(ethylene glycol) corona employed to improve nanoparticles’ diffusion in the lung mucus. This study aims to measure this phenomenon by comparing the behavior in a murine lung inflammation model of three liposomal platforms designed to represent different poly(ethylene glycol) and hyaluronic acid densities (Liposome-PEG, Liposome-PEG-HA and Liposome-HA). In this work, the liposomes were obtained by a one-step ethanol injection method. Their interaction with mucin and targeting ability toward pro-inflammatory macrophages were then investigated in vitro and in vivo in a LPS model of lung inflammation. In vitro, poly(ethylene glycol) free HA-liposomes display a superior targeting efficiency toward M1 macrophages, while the addition of poly(ethylene glycol) induces better mucus mobility. Interestingly in vivo studies revealed that the three liposomes showed distinct cell specificity with alveolar macrophages demonstrating an avidity for poly(ethylene glycol) free HA-liposomes, while neutrophils favored PEGylated liposomes exempt of HA. Those results could be explained by the presence of two forces exercising a balance between mucus penetration and receptor targeting.

Our study can be considered is one more step towards using E2 to prevent the local and remote inflammatory response after descending thoracic aorta cross-clamping. Abstract\nAs a consequence of systemic inflammation caused by ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) due to aortic occlusion, the lungs can exhibit increased microvascular permeability, local release of pro-inflammatory mediators, and leukocyte infiltration. Lung tissue infiltration by activated neutrophils is followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is linked to acute pulmonary microvascular damage, high mortality rates, and organ dysfunction. Previous studies have demonstrated that female sex hormones modulate the inflammatory response and that prophylactic treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2) can prevent fatalities and preserve mesenteric perfusion and intestinal integrity after ischemia/reperfusion induced by aortic occlusion. In this study, we focused on the protective effects of estradiol after aortic ischemia/reperfusion by evaluating lung injury and endothelial alterations. Upon anesthesia and mechanical ventilation, male rats were subjected to aortic occlusion for 20 min, followed by 2 h of reperfusion. In parallel, one group of rats received a single injection of estradiol (280 µg/kg, i.v.) 30 min before ischemia. We observed increased serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 in the I/R rats and E2 was able to reduce them. E2 effects after 2 h of reperfusion resulted mainly in decreasing of edema, iNOS expression and preventing leukocyte infiltration. Overall, our data indicate that estradiol might be a supplementary approach to deal with systemic processes and lung deterioration.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1665705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665705600,"objectID":"42eda9836b9892aff3432c9ff5f9a6a5","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36252489/","publishdate":"2022-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36252489/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nAortic ischemia and reperfusion leads to lung inflammatory activation with edema and leukocyte infiltration.

However, the role of S1P signaling in MSC MV to restore lung protein permeability is unknown.\nMethods: In this study, we hypothesized that MSC MV might restore lung permeability in part through increasing intracellular S1P signaling pathway in injured HLMVEC independent of S1P receptors. We used the transwell co-culture system to study the effect of MSC MV on protein permeability of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) damaged HLMVEC.\nResults: Our results showed that LPS significantly increased the permeability of HLMVEC to FITC-dextran (70 kDa) within 24 h. MSC MV restores this permeability and, to a large extent, prevents the cytoskeleton protein F-actin from recombining into “actin stress fibers,” and restores the positions of tight junctions and adhesion junctions in the damaged HLMVEC. This therapeutic effect of MSC MV was related to the increase in the S1P level in injured HLMVEC and was not eliminated when adding the antagonist of S1P receptor, suggesting that MSC MV to restore lung permeability was independent of S1P receptors on HLMVEC. Laser confocal further observed that Ca2+ mobilization and Rac1 activation in LPS injured HLMVEC were increased in parallel with the increase in intracellular S1P level after MSC MV treatment.\nConclusions: In short, MSC MV partially restored protein permeability across HLMVEC through the intracellular S1P signaling pathway independent of S1P receptor-1.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1665705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665705600,"objectID":"04f348a6d4d35959ea85a46198d0f391","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36209115/","publishdate":"2022-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36209115/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Microvesicles (MVs) derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) were demonstrated to restore lung protein permeability and attenuate acute lung injury.

This study aimed to define the role of succinate, a key microbiota metabolite, in intestinal I/R-induced ALI progression.\nMethods: Gut and lung microbiota of mice subjected to intestinal I/R were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Succinate level alterations were measured in Germ-free (GF) mice or conventional mice treated with antibiotics. Succinate-induced alveolar macrophage polarisation and its effects on alveolar epithelial apoptosis were evaluated in succinate receptor1 (Sucnr1)-deficient mice and in murine alveolar macrophages transfected with Sucnr1-siRNA. Succinate levels were measured in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, including intestinal I/R.\nResults: Succinate accumulated in lungs after intestinal I/R, and this was associated with an imbalance of succinate-producing and succinate-consuming bacteria in the gut, but not the lungs. Succinate accumulation was absent in GF mice and was reversed by gut microbiota depletion with antibiotics, indicating that gut microbiota are a source of lung succinate. Moreover, succinate promoted alveolar macrophage polarisation, alveolar epithelial apoptosis, and lung injury during intestinal I/R. Conversely, knockdown of Sucnr1 or blockage of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo reversed the effects of succinate by modulating PI3K-AKT/HIF-1α pathway. Plasma succinate levels significantly correlated with intestinal I/R-related lung injury after cardiopulmonary bypass.\nConclusion: Gut microbiota-derived succinate exacerbates intestinal I/R-induced ALI through SUCNR1-dependent alveolar macrophage polarisation, identifying succinate as a novel target for gut-derived ALI in critically ill patients.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1665619200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665619200,"objectID":"8dbe6795cd8c29e1ffa3e27bc2978596","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36229053/","publishdate":"2022-10-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36229053/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nIntroduction: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R).

The study aimed to assess the protective effects of OAA on PQ-induced ALI and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. Our data demonstrated that OAA treatment significantly alleviated PQ-induced ALI and improved the survival rate of PQ-poisoned mice, and also alleviated PQ-induced cellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. OAA-mediated alleviation of PQ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction depends on the following mechanisms which may explain the above findings: 1) OAA effectively cleared intracellular ROS, inhibited ROS accumulation, and mitochondrial depolarization; 2) OAA inhibited the downregulation of L-OPA1 and MFN2 caused by PQ and promoted a dynamic balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission, and 3) the expression of PGC-1α, TFAM, COX2, and COX4I1, increased significantly following OAA intervention which improved mitochondrial respiratory functions and promoted its biogenesis and energy metabolism in damaged cells.

Studies have shown that interleukin 1 plays a major role in the pathophysiology of preterm birth by inducing the production of proinflammatory mediators and uterine activation proteins leading to labor. More importantly, uteroplacental inflammation, associated with preterm birth parturition pathways, is detrimental to fetal tissues and leads to long-term sequelae. Our group has developed an allosteric antagonist of the interleukin 1 receptor, rytvela, found to be potent and safe in preventing preterm birth by suppressing inflammation via the inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway while preserving the Nuclear factor kappa B pathway (important in immune vigilance). Rytvela has been shown to inhibit inflammatory up-regulation and uterine activation while preserving fetal development.\nObjective: This study aimed to further the preclinical development of rytvela by evaluating its optimal dose and minimal duration of treatment to inhibit the inflammatory cascade, prolong gestation, and promote neonatal outcomes.\nStudy design: Pregnant CD-1 mice were administered with lipopolysaccharide (10 μg, intraperitoneal administration) or interleukin 1 (1 μg/kg, intrauterine administration) on gestational day 16 to induce preterm labor. Rytvela was administered at different doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 mg/kg/d subcutaneously) from gestational days 16 to 18.5. To evaluate the minimal duration of treatment, the mice were administered with rytvela (2 mg/kg/d subcutaneously) for 24, 36, or 48 hours. The rate of prematurity (gestational day \u0026lt;18.5) and neonate survival and weight were evaluated. Gestational tissues were collected at gestational day 17.5 to quantify cytokines, proinflammatory mediators, and uterine activating proteins by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The neonatal lungs and intestines were collected from postnatal days 5 to 7 and analyzed by histology.\nResults: Rytvela exhibited a dose-response profile and achieved maximum efficacy at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d by reducing 70% of lipopolysaccharide-induced preterm births and 60% of interleukin 1β-induced preterm births. In addition, rytvela attained maximum efficacy at a dose of 1 mg/kg/d by increasing neonate survival by up to 65% in both models of preterm birth. Rytvela protected fetuses from inflammatory insult as of 24 hours, preserving lung and intestinal integrity, and prevented preterm birth and fetal mortality by 60% and 50%, respectively, as of 36 hours of treatment.\nConclusion: The maximum efficacy of rytvela was achieved at 2 mg/kg/d with improved birth outcomes and prevented inflammatory up-regulation upon 36 hours (only) of treatment.

Nitroreductase (NTR) is significantly upregulated under hypoxia, which is commonly regarded as a potential biomarker for assessing sepsis-induced acute lung hypoxia. Increasing evidence shows that NTR in the Golgi apparatus could be induced in sepsis-induced ALI. Meanwhile, the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor (dimethyloxalylglycine, DMOG) attenuated sepsis-induced ALI through further increasing the level of Golgi NTR by improving hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activity, but as yet, no Golgi-targetable probe has been developed for monitoring and assessing treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI. Herein, we report a Golgi-targetable probe, Gol-NTR, for monitoring and assessing treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI through mapping the generation of NTR. The probe displayed high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 54.8 ng/mL and good selectivity to NTR.

ALI was induced by intratracheal administration of LPS in experimental mice with or without Sch B treatment.\nResults: Our studies show that Sch B differentially modulates inflammatory factor induction by LPS in macrophages by directly binding myeloid differentiation response factor-88 (MyD88), an essential adaptor protein in the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) pathway. Sch B spares non-MyD88-pathways downstream of TLR4. Such inhibition suppressed key signaling mediators such as TAK1, MAPKs, and NF-κB, and pro-inflammatory factor induction. Pull down assay using biotinylated-Sch B validate the direct interaction between Sch B and MyD88 in macrophages. Treatment of mice with Sch B prior to LPS challenge reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in lungs, induction of MyD88-pathway signaling proteins, and prevented inflammatory cytokine induction.\nConclusion: In summary, our studies have identified MyD88 as a direct target of Sch B for its anti-inflammatory activity, and suggest that Sch B may have therapeutic value for acute lung injury and other MyD88-dependent inflammatory diseases.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1665532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665532800,"objectID":"e708c426751e7fee2b591647837b7024","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36270224/","publishdate":"2022-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36270224/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a challenging clinical syndrome that manifests as an acute inflammatory response.

The progression of silicosis to pulmonary fibrosis is usually unavoidable. Recent studies have revealed positivity for the overexpression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in pulmonary fibrosis and shown that the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 attenuated pulmonary fibrosis after bleomycin challenge and paraquat exposure. However, it is unclear whether AMD3100 reduces crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.\nMethods: C57BL/6 male mice were instilled intranasally with a single dose of crystalline silica (12 mg/60 μL) to establish an acute silicosis mouse model. Twelve hours later, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg AMD3100 or control solution. Then, the mice were weighed daily and sacrificed on day 7, 14, or 28 to collect lung tissue and peripheral blood. Western blotting was also applied to determine the level of CXCR4, while different histological techniques were used to assess pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In addition, the level of B cells in peripheral blood was measured by flow cytometry.\nResults: CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 were upregulated in the lung tissues of crystalline silica-exposed mice. Blocking CXCR4 with AMD3100 suppressed the upregulation of CXCR4/CXCL12, reduced the severity of lung injury, and prevented weight loss. It also inhibited neutrophil infiltration at inflammatory sites and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, as well as reduced B-lymphocyte aggregates in the lung. Additionally, it decreased the recruitment of circulating fibrocytes (CD45+collagen I+CXCR4+) to the lung and the deposition of collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin in lung tissue. AMD3100 also increased the level of B cells in peripheral blood, preventing circulating B cells from migrating to the injured lungs.\nConclusion: Blocking CXCR4 with AMD3100 delays pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in a silicosis mouse model, suggesting the potential of AMD3100 as a drug for treating silicosis.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1665446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665446400,"objectID":"50c42674ce021cd3b0384c64cdc9b546","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36238768/","publishdate":"2022-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36238768/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Silicosis is a severe pulmonary disease caused by inhaling dust containing crystalline silica.

This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of SFN on HPH. Male mice were exposed to persistent chronic hypoxia for 4 weeks to induce HPH. The results demonstrated that SFN repressed the increased right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and attenuated the right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary arteries remodeling in HPH mice. In particular, after SFN treatment, the CD68 positive cells in lung sections were reduced; TNF-α and IL-6 levels in lungs and serum declined; activation of NF-κB in PASMCs was inhibited in response to hypoxia. Besides, SFN enhanced the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum, SOD2 expression, total glutathione levels, and GSH/GSSG ratio in PASMCs, along with a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in serum and ROS production in PASMCs after hypoxia exposure. Notably, SFN, as an Nrf2 activator, reversed the reduction in Nrf2 expression in hypoxic PASMCs. In vitro, SFN treatment inhibited hyperproliferation and promoted apoptosis of PASMCs under hypoxia conditions. SFN also prevented the apoptosis of pulmonary microvascular ECs caused by hypoxia. Therefore, these data suggested that SFN could significantly restrain the inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting PASMCs proliferation, promoting PASMCs apoptosis, and reversing hypoxia injury in ECs to improve pulmonary vascular remodeling.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1665273600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665273600,"objectID":"90eccb2eef4591bf4223ce3597a8ccbc","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36220525/","publishdate":"2022-10-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36220525/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nHypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH) is a cardiopulmonary disease featured by pulmonary vascular remodeling, which is due to abnormal proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and dysfunction of endothelial cells (ECs).","tags":["Cell Death","Lung","Tissue Injury","Apoptosis","Immunology","Inflammation"],"title":"Sulforaphane alleviated vascular remodeling in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension via inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nLong non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays important roles in a series of biological processes.

However, the role of STING in causing CKD, including diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and Alport syndrome, is unknown.\nMethods: To investigate whether STING activation contributes to the development and progression of glomerular diseases such as DKD and Alport syndrome, immortalized human and murine podocytes were differentiated for 14 days and treated with a STING-specific agonist. We used diabetic db/db mice, mice with experimental Alport syndrome, C57BL/6 mice, and STING knockout mice to assess the role of the STING signaling pathway in kidney failure.\nResults: In vitro, murine and human podocytes express all of the components of the cGAS-STING pathway. In vivo, activation of STING renders C57BL/6 mice susceptible to albuminuria and podocyte loss. STING is activated at baseline in mice with experimental DKD and Alport syndrome. STING activation occurs in the glomerular but not the tubulointerstitial compartment in association with autophagic podocyte death in Alport syndrome mice and with apoptotic podocyte death in DKD mouse models. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of STING protects from progression of kidney disease in mice with DKD and Alport syndrome and increases lifespan in Alport syndrome mice.\nConclusion: The activation of the STING pathway acts as a mediator of disease progression in DKD and Alport syndrome.

The relative abundance of Haemophilus and Neisseria also declined with severity. Multiple microbiome measures tracked with measures of systemic immune responses and COVID outcomes. For many of the conclusions drawn in these studies, the direction of causality is unknown-did an alteration in the microbiome result in increased COVID severity, did COVID severity alter the microbiome, or was some third factor the primary driver, such as medication use. Follow-up mechanistic studies can help answer these questions.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1664928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664928000,"objectID":"bdc053d920c9919393a0e86285411545","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36195943/","publishdate":"2022-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36195943/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nSARS-CoV-2 infection causes COVID-19 disease, which can result in consequences ranging from undetectable to fatal, focusing attention on the modulators of outcomes.

In rare cases, viral proteins dampen antiviral responses by mimicking critical regions of human histone proteins, particularly those containing post-translational modifications required for transcriptional regulation. Recent work has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 markedly disrupts host cell epigenetic regulation. However, how SARS-CoV-2 controls the host cell epigenome and whether it uses histone mimicry to do so remain unclear. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 protein encoded by ORF8 (ORF8) functions as a histone mimic of the ARKS motifs in histone H3 to disrupt host cell epigenetic regulation. ORF8 is associated with chromatin, disrupts regulation of critical histone post-translational modifications and promotes chromatin compaction. Deletion of either the ORF8 gene or the histone mimic site attenuates the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to disrupt host cell chromatin, affects the transcriptional response to infection and attenuates viral genome copy number. These findings demonstrate a new function of ORF8 and a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 disrupts host cell epigenetic regulation. Further, this work provides a molecular basis for the finding that SARS-CoV-2 lacking ORF8 is associated with decreased severity of COVID-19.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1664928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664928000,"objectID":"fe2511e7c1ec14265c858093b182657c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36198800/","publishdate":"2022-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36198800/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged at the end of 2019 and caused the devastating global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in part because of its ability to effectively suppress host cell responses.","tags":["Virology","Microbiology","Microbial Infections","Interactome","Coronavirus","SARS-CoV-2/COVID19","Host-Pathogen Interactions","Epigenetics"],"title":"SARS-CoV-2 disrupts host epigenetic regulation via histone mimicry","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nAn immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment is a major obstacle in the control of pancreatic and other solid cancers.

Here we show that the administration of five distinct STING agonists, including cGAMP, results in an expansion of human and mouse interleukin (IL)-35+ regulatory B cells in pancreatic cancer. Mechanistically, cGAMP drives expression of IL-35 by B cells in an IRF3-dependent but type I interferon-independent manner. In several preclinical cancer models, the loss of STING signalling in B cells increases tumour control. Furthermore, anti-IL-35 blockade or genetic ablation of IL-35 in B cells also reduces tumour growth. Unexpectedly, the STING-IL-35 axis in B cells reduces proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells and attenuates the NK-driven anti-tumour response.

We found that THSG significantly attenuated lung injury by reducing fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition. THSG treatment significantly downregulated the expression levels of TGF-β1, fibronectin, α-SMA, CTGF, and TGFBR2, however, upregulated the expression levels of antioxidants (SOD-1 and catalase) and LC3B in the lungs of BLM-treated mice. THSG treatment decreased the expression levels of fibronectin, α-SMA, and CTGF in TGF-β1-stimulated MRC-5 cells. Conversely, THSG increased the expression levels of SOD-1 and catalase. Furthermore, treatment of THSG profoundly reduced the TGF-β1-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, THSG restored TGF-β1-induced impaired autophagy, accompany by increasing the protein levels of LC3B-II and Beclin 1.

Neuronal SIRT1 reduced bone mass by increasing SNS signaling. SIRT1 did so by increasing expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), a SIRT1 target that reduces brain serotonin levels by inducing its catabolism and by suppressing tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) expression and serotonin synthesis in the brain stem. SIRT1 upregulated brain catecholamine synthesis indirectly through serotonin, but did not directly affect dopamine β hydroxylase (Dbh) expression in the locus coeruleus.

However, the impact on lung function of using aged coils has not been reported. We investigated the relationship between coil age and acute lung injury in mice exposed to experimental vaping for 1 h (2 puffs/min, 100 ml/puff). The e-liquid contains propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (50:50, vol) only. The concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in the vaping aerosols increased with age of the nichrome coils starting at 1200 puffs. Mice exposed to e-cigarette aerosols produced from 1800, but not 0 or 900, puff-aged coils caused acute lung injury, increased lung wet/dry weight ratio, and induced lung inflammation (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP-2).

In conclusion, we observed that the concentration of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) increased with repeated and prolonged usage of e-cigarette coils.

Severe cases of viral lung infections are often associated with a cytokine storm and alternating platelet numbers. We report that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) sense a non-systemic influenza A virus (IAV) infection via inflammatory cytokines. Irrespective of antiviral treatment or vaccination, at a certain threshold of IAV titer in the lung, CD41-positive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) enter the cell cycle while endothelial protein C receptor-positive CD41-negative HSCs remain quiescent. Active CD41-positive HSCs represent the source of megakaryocytes, while their multi-lineage reconstitution potential is reduced. This emergency megakaryopoiesis is thrombopoietin independent and attenuated in IAV-infected interleukin-1 receptor-deficient mice. Newly produced platelets during IAV infection are immature and hyper-reactive. After viral clearance, HSC quiescence is re-established.

However, the mechanisms that inhibit aberrant IFN upregulation in homeostasis and the impacts of tonic IFN production on health and disease remain enigmatic. Here, we report that caspase-8 negatively regulates type I IFN production by inhibiting the RIPK1-TBK1 axis during homeostasis across multiple cell types and tissues. When caspase-8 is deleted or inhibited, RIPK1 interacts with TBK1 to drive elevated IFN production, leading to heightened resistance to norovirus infection in macrophages but also early onset lymphadenopathy in mice.

These repeats can be translated into a polyglycine-containing protein, uN2CpolyG, which forms protein inclusions and is toxic in cell models, albeit through an unknown mechanism. Here, we established a transgenic Drosophila model expressing uN2CpolyG in multiple systems, which resulted in progressive neuronal cell loss, locomotor deficiency, and shortened lifespan. Interestingly, electron microscopy revealed mitochondrial swelling both in transgenic flies and in muscle biopsies of individuals with NIID. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy showed colocalization of uN2CpolyG with mitochondria in cell and patient samples, while biochemical analysis revealed that uN2CpolyG interacted with a mitochondrial RNA binding protein, LRPPRC (leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat motif-containing protein). Furthermore, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis and functional assays showed down-regulated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in uN2CpolyG-expressing flies and NIID muscle biopsies. Finally, idebenone treatment restored mitochondrial function and alleviated neurodegenerative phenotypes in transgenic flies. Overall, these results indicate that transgenic flies expressing uN2CpolyG recapitulate key features of NIID and that reversing mitochondrial dysfunction might provide a potential therapeutic approach for this disorder.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1664755200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664755200,"objectID":"3776f1b3900fa6d6e13c129e41ce6870","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36191230/","publishdate":"2022-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36191230/","section":"article","summary":"Significance\nCGG repeat expansion in the 5′ untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC gene was reported to be associated with a neuromuscular/neurodegenerative disease, neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID).

Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy that shows promise in stabilizing BOS patients, but its mechanisms of action are unclear. In a mouse lung transplant model, we show that ECP blunts alloimmune responses and inhibits BOS through lowering airway TGF-β bioavailability without altering its expression. Surprisingly, ECP-treated leukocytes were primarily engulfed by alveolar macrophages (AMs), which were reprogrammed to become less responsive to TGF-β and reduce TGF-β bioavailability through secretion of the TGF-β antagonist decorin. In untreated recipients, high airway TGF-β activity stimulated AMs to express CCL2, leading to CCR2+ monocyte-driven BOS development. Moreover, we found TGF-β receptor 2-dependent differentiation of CCR2+ monocytes was required for the generation of monocyte-derived AMs, which in turn promoted BOS by expanding tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells that inflicted airway injury through Blimp-1-mediated granzyme B expression. Thus, through studying the effects of ECP, we have identified an AM functional plasticity that controls a TGF-β-dependent network that couples CCR2+ monocyte recruitment and differentiation to alloimmunity and BOS.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1664755200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664755200,"objectID":"8bb2ba8069a29e0febd9aa6be7e93960","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36189800/","publishdate":"2022-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36189800/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a major impediment to lung transplant survival and is generally resistant to medical therapy.

In the present study, we aim to investigate the effect of IUI on lung development, and to identify the key molecule involved in this process and its epigenetic regulatory mechanism.\nResults: Serpine1 was upregulated in the lung tissue of neonatal mice with IUI. Intranasal delivery of Serpine1 siRNA markedly reversed IUI-induced lung injury. Serpine1 overexpression substantially promoted cell senescence of both human and murine lung epithelial cells, reflected by decreased cell proliferation and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, G0/G1 cell fraction, senescence marker, and oxidative and DNA damage marker expression. IUI decreased the methylation level of the Serpine1 promoter, and methylation of the promoter led to transcriptional repression of Serpine1. Furthermore, IUI promoted the expression of Tet1 potentially through TNF-α, while Tet1 facilitated the demethylation of Serpine1 promoter. DNA pull-down and ChIP assays revealed that the Serpine1 promoter was regulated by Rela and Hdac2. DNA demethylation increased the recruitment of Rela to the Serpine1 promoter and induced the release of Hdac2.\nConclusion: Increased Serpine1 expression mediated by DNA demethylation causes lung injury in neonatal mice with IUI.

This largely untreatable chronic airway disease results in irreversible destruction of lung architecture. The small lung hypothesis is now supported by epidemiological, physiological and clinical studies. Accordingly, the early and severe COPD phenotype carries the most dreadful prognosis and finds its roots during lung growth. Pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood and implicate individual susceptibility (genetics), a large part of environmental factors (viral infections, tobacco consumption, air pollution) and the combined effects of those triggers on gene expression. Genetic susceptibility is most likely involved as the disease is severe and starts early in life. The latter observation led to the identification of Mendelian inheritance via disease-causing variants of SERPINA1 - known as the basis for alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and TERT. In the last two decades multiple genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with COPD. High significance SNPs are located in 4q31 near HHIP which encodes an evolutionarily highly conserved physiological inhibitor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (HH). HHIP is critical to several in utero developmental lung processes. It is also implicated in homeostasis, injury response, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor resistance to apoptosis. A few studies have reported decreased HHIP RNA and protein levels in human adult COPD lungs. HHIP+/- murine models led to emphysema. HH pathway inhibitors, such as vismodegib and sonidegib, are already validated in oncology, whereas other drugs have evidenced in vitro effects. Targeting the Hedgehog pathway could lead to a new therapeutic avenue in COPD.

Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) has recently been linked to MHC class II silencing in leukemic blasts; however, the regulation of MHC class II expression remains incompletely understood. Utilizing unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we identify that the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) complex transcriptionally represses MHC class II pathway genes, while the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex component FBXO11 mediates degradation of CIITA, the principal transcription factor regulating MHC class II expression. Targeting these repressive mechanisms selectively induces MHC class II upregulation across a range of AML cell lines. Functionally, MHC class II+ leukemic blasts stimulate antigen-dependent CD4+ T cell activation and potent anti-tumor immune responses, providing fundamental insights into the graft-versus-leukemia effect.

Given the high prevalence and high mortality rate of AKI, the development of drugs to effectively treat AKI is a huge unmet medical need and a research hotspot. Although existing evidence fully demonstrates that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) burst at the AKI site is a major contributor to AKI progression, the heterogeneity, complexity, and unique physiological structure of the kidney make most antioxidant and anti-inflammatory small molecule drugs ineffective because of the lack of kidney targeting and side effects. Recently, nanodrugs with intrinsic kidney targeting through the control of size, shape, and surface properties have opened exciting prospects for the treatment of AKI. Many antioxidant nanodrugs have emerged to address the limitations of current AKI treatments. In this review, we systematically summarized for the first time about the emerging nanodrugs that exploit the pathological and physiological features of the kidney to overcome the limitations of traditional small-molecule drugs to achieve high AKI efficacy. First, we analyzed the pathological structural characteristics of AKI and the main pathological mechanism of AKI: hypoxia, harmful substance accumulation-induced RONS burst at the renal site despite the multifactorial initiation and heterogeneity of AKI. Subsequently, we introduced the strategies used to improve renal targeting and reviewed advances of nanodrugs for AKI: nano-RONS-sacrificial agents, antioxidant nanozymes, and nanocarriers for antioxidants and anti-inflammatory drugs. These nanodrugs have demonstrated excellent therapeutic effects, such as greatly reducing oxidative stress damage, restoring renal function, and low side effects. Finally, we discussed the challenges and future directions for translating nanodrugs into clinical AKI treatment.\n\u0026lt; Back to Reviews Alternative to Homepage ","date":1664409600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664409600,"objectID":"a81f0a6b1f897ad79b14ffc865199dd4","permalink":"https://example.com/review/36203963/","publishdate":"2022-09-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/review/36203963/","section":"review","summary":"Highlights\nAKI is a common clinical acute syndrome with high morbidity and mortality but without effective clinical drug available.

We found that the expression of NLRC5 was strongly induced by virus infection and IFNB or IFNG stimulation in different cell lines. Overexpression of NLRC5 remarkably suppressed DENV infection, whereas knockout of NLRC5 led to a significant increase in DENV infection. Mechanistic study revealed that NLRC5 interacted with the viral nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) protease domain and mediated degradation of NS3 through a ubiquitin-dependent selective macroautophagy/autophagy pathway. We demonstrated that NLRC5 recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL2 (cullin 2) to catalyze K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of the NS3 protease domain, which subsequently served as a recognition signal for cargo receptor TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Together, we have demonstrated that NLRC5 exerted an antiviral effect by mediating the degradation of a multifunctional protein of DENV, providing a novel antiviral signal axis of NLRC5-CUL2-NS3-TOLLIP.

By performing a candidate expression screening, we discovered that the TMEM175 gene encodes a proton-activated, proton-selective channel (LyPAP) that is required for lysosomal H+ “leak” currents. The activity of LyPAP is most active when lysosomes are hyper-acidified, and cells lacking TMEM175 exhibit lysosomal hyper-acidification and impaired proteolytic degradation, both of which can be restored by optimizing lysosomal pH using pharmacological agents. Variants of TMEM175 that are associated with susceptibility to Parkinson disease (PD) cause a reduction in TMEM175-dependent LyPAP currents and lysosomal hyper-acidification. Hence, our studies not only reveal an essential H+-dissipating pathway in lysosomes, but also provide a molecular target to regulate pH-dependent lysosomal functions and associated pathologies.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1664409600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664409600,"objectID":"319adb750b0c1edcf655135324c992f6","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36120744/","publishdate":"2022-09-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36120744/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nThe acidic environment within lysosomes is maintained within a narrow pH range (pH 4.5-5.0) optimal for digesting autophagic cargo macromolecules so that the resulting building block metabolites can be reused.","tags":["Lysosome"],"title":"The Acid Gate in the Lysosome","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nThe precise regulation of gene expression is fundamental to neurodevelopment, plasticity and cognitive function.

Lycopene inhibits oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the kidney of mice with aristolochic acid nephropathy. Activation of Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway is critical to inhibit the development of renal inflammatory response. Lycopene activates the Nrf2 antioxidant system and then inhibits apoptosis. Abstract\nLycopene (LYC) is a carotenoid, has antioxidant properties. This study investigated whether lycopene attenuates aristolochic acids (AAs) -induced chronic kidney disease. In this experiment, lycopene was used to intervene C57BL/6 mice with renal injury induced by aristolochic acid exposure. The histomorphological changes and serological parameters of the kidney were measured in order to assess the alleviating effect of lycopene on renal injury in aristolochic acid nephropathy. In vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to verify the main mechanism of action and drug targets of lycopene in improving aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) and by various experimental methods such as ELISA, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Western-blot and qRT-PCR. The results showed that oxidative stress injury was induced in the kidney of mice after AAI exposure, resulting in inflammatory response and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. The results showed that the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway was inhibited after AAI exposure. AAI induces oxidative stress injury in the kidney, which ultimately leads to inflammation and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. After LYC intervened in the body, it activated Nrf2 nuclear translocation and its downstream HO-1 and NQO1 antioxidant signaling pathways. LYC inhibited ROS production by renal tubular epithelial cells, and alleviated mitochondrial damage. LYC further modulated the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling cascade, thereby reduced the accumulation of inflammatory factors in the renal interstitium. Moreover, LYC was able to up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2, down-regulate Bax expression and inhibit the activation of cleaved forms of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3, which finally attenuated the apoptosis of the mitochondrial pathway induced by AAI exposure. It was concluded that lycopene was able to activate the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway to maintain the homeostasis of renal oxidative stress and ultimately attenuated renal inflammatory response and apoptosis. These results suggested that lycopene can be used as a drug to relieve AAN.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1664323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664323200,"objectID":"17b57dc80bbbb67777b7e519ea072d38","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36198206/","publishdate":"2022-09-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36198206/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nLycopene improves renal dysfunction in mice with aristolochic acid nephropathy.

SYQP exerted anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects in vivo and in vitro. SYQP alleviated ALI by inhibiting TLR4/COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway. Abstract\nTetrastigma Hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg (Sanyeqing, SYQ), a traditional herb native to China, has been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, febrile convulsions and dysentery. Previous studies have demonstrated the hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects of polysaccharides from SYQ (SYQP). However, the role of SYQP in acute lung injury (ALI) remained unknown. Our present study aimed to explore the protective effects of SYQP in ALI and explained its underlying mechanism. In vivo, Balb/c mice were intragastrically administered with SYQP and dexamethasone (DXMS) for 14 days which were intratracheally instilled (IT) with LPS at the last day. In vitro, A549 cells were pretreated with SYQP, DXMS or TAK-242, following by LPS stimulation for 24 h. The histopathological results showed that SYQP remarkably alleviated pulmonary macrophage infiltration and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels. Additionally, SYQP evidently suppressed wet/dry (W/D) ratio of lung and white blood cells (WBC) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Moreover, SYQP markedly reduced TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and COX-2 levels both in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, SYQP significantly attenuated oxidative stress through upregulating the levels of SOD and GSH-Px and downregulating the expressions of MDA and LDH in vivo, which was confirmed by in vitro results that SYQP could increase SOD activity and decrease MDA and NO contents. Importantly, a decline in protein expressions of TLR4, COX-2, NF-κB p50, phospho-NF-κB p65 and phospho-IκB-α was detected in vivo and in vitro.

PANoptosis is a unique innate immune inflammatory cell death pathway regulated by multifaceted macromolecular complexes called PANoptosomes, which integrate components from other cell death pathways. Growing evidence shows that PANoptosis can be triggered in many physiological conditions, including viral and bacterial infections, cytokine storms, and cancers. However, PANoptosomes at the single cell level have not yet been fully characterized. Initial investigations have suggested that key pyroptotic, apoptotic, and necroptotic molecules including the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC, apoptotic caspase-8 (CASP8), and necroptotic RIPK3 are conserved components of PANoptosomes. Here, we optimized an immunofluorescence procedure to probe the highly dynamic multiprotein PANoptosome complexes across various innate immune cell death-inducing conditions. We first identified and validated antibodies to stain endogenous mouse ASC, CASP8, and RIPK3, without residual staining in the respective knockout cells. We then assessed the formation of PANoptosomes across innate immune cell death-inducing conditions by monitoring the colocalization of ASC with CASP8 and/or RIPK3. Finally, we established an expansion microscopy procedure using these validated antibodies to image the organization of ASC, CASP8, and RIPK3 within the PANoptosome. This optimized protocol, which can be easily adapted to study other multiprotein complexes and other cell death triggers, provides confirmation of PANoptosome assembly in individual cells and forms the foundation for a deeper molecular understanding of the PANoptosome complex and PANoptosis to facilitate therapeutic targeting.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1664323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664323200,"objectID":"194e2df66fd1515ee0170aa48b0de60a","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36169732/","publishdate":"2022-09-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36169732/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nIn response to infection or sterile insults, inflammatory programmed cell death is an essential component of the innate immune response to remove infected or damaged cells.

To help define this, we studied autopsy kidneys from 50 adults with median age 68 years and median eGFR 73.5 mL/min/1.73m2 without apparent glomerular disease in a cross-sectional analysis. The number of NSG per kidney was estimated using the physical dissector/fractionator combination, while podometrics were estimated using model-based stereology. The number of NSG per kidney was directly correlated with podocyte number per tuft and podocyte density. Each additional 100,000 NSG per kidney was associated with 26 more podocytes per glomerulus and 16 podocytes per 106 μm3 increase in podocyte density. These associations were independent of clinical factors and cortical zone. While podocyte number per glomerulus was similar in the three zones, superficial glomeruli were the smallest and had the highest podocyte density but smallest podocytes. Increasing age and hypertension were associated with lower podocyte number, with age mostly affecting superficial glomeruli, and hypertension mostly affecting juxtamedullary glomeruli. Thus, in this first study to report a direct correlation between the number of NSG and podometrics, we suggest that podocyte number is decreasing in NSG of individuals losing nephrons.

Herein, we established an intratracheal instillation of a ZnONP-induced ALI mouse model and found that the inhalation of ZnONPs caused ALI along with a perturbation of intestinal flora. Antibiotic cocktail treatment-mediated depletion of intestinal microbiota aggravated ZnONP-induced ALI, and in contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation-mediated restoration of intestinal microbiota exerted the opposite effects. A decrease in short-chain fatty acids, the intestinal microbiota-derived metabolites in the plasma-in particular, acetic acid and propionic acid-occurred after exposure to ZnONPs. It is important to note that supplementation with propionic acid, but not acetic acid, ameliorated ZnONP-induced ALI. We also showed that the source of inflammatory cytokines might partially be the infiltration of macrophages. Supplementation with propionic acid was found to act on macrophages through the receptor GPR43, because knockdown of GPR43 sharply reversed the protective effects of propionic acid during the ZnONP-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress in both primary alveolar macrophages and RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines.

Despite its importance as a regulator of injury/repair responses, the relationship between CHI3L1 and pulmonary vascular remodeling is not well understood. We hypothesize that CHI3L1 and its signaling pathways contribute to the vascular remodeling responses that occur in pulmonary hypertension (PH). We examined the relationship of plasma CHI3L1 levels and severity of PH in patients with various forms of PH, including group 1 PAH and group 3 PH, and found that circulating levels of serum CHI3L1 were associated with worse hemodynamics and correlated directly with mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. We also used transgenic mice with constitutive knockout and inducible overexpression of CHI3L1 to examine its role in hypoxia-, monocrotaline-, and bleomycin-induced models of pulmonary vascular disease. In all 3 mouse models of pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary hypertensive responses were mitigated in CHI3L1-null mice and accentuated in transgenic mice that overexpress CHI3L1. Finally, CHI3L1 alone was sufficient to induce pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation, inhibit pulmonary vascular endothelial cell apoptosis, induce the loss of endothelial barrier function, and induce endothelial-mesenchymal transition. These findings demonstrate that CHI3L1 and its receptors play an integral role in pulmonary vascular disease pathobiology and may offer a target for the treatment of PAH and PH associated with fibrotic lung disease.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1663804800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663804800,"objectID":"8644269d16932952a25eb47b6e0d21c5","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35951428/","publishdate":"2022-09-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35951428/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nChitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1) is the prototypic chitinase-like protein mediating inflammation, cell proliferation, and tissue remodeling.

The expression level of circPAK1 was detected by qRT-PCR in HCC and paired with normal liver tissue samples. The effects of circPAK1 on proliferation, invasion, metastasis and apoptosis of HCC cells were evaluated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. We also constructed Chitosan/si-circPAK1 (CS/si-circPAK1) nanocomplexes using Chitosan material to evaluate its in vivo therapeutic effect on HCC. High-throughput sequencing, RNA-sequencing, RNA probe pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation and Co-Immunoprecipitation assays were performed to explore the relationship between circPAK1, 14-3-3ζ, p-LATS1 and YAP. Exosomes isolated from lenvatinib-resistant HCC cell lines were used to evaluate the relationship between exosomal circPAK1 and lenvatinib resistance.\nResults: CircPAK1, a novel circRNA, is highly expressed in HCC tumor tissues and cell lines as well as correlated with poor outcomes in HCC patients. Functionally, circPAK1 knockdown inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis while circPAK1 overexpression promoted HCC progression. The tumor-promoting phenotypes of circPAK1 on HCC were also confirmed by animal experiments. Importantly, the application of CS/si-circPAK1 nanocomplexes showed a better therapeutic effect on tumor growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, circPAK1 enhanced HCC progression by inactivating the Hippo signaling pathway, and this kind of inactivation is based on its competitively binding of 14-3-3 ζ with YAP, which weakens the recruitment and cytoplasmic fixation of 14-3-3 ζ to YAP, thus promoting YAP nucleus localization. Additionally, circPAK1 could be transported by exosomes from lenvatinib-resistant cells to sensitive cells and induce lenvatinib resistance of receipt cells.\nConclusion: CircPAK1 exerts its oncogenic function by competitively binding 14-3-3 ζ with YAP, thus promoting YAP nucleus localization, leading to the inactivation of a Hippo signaling pathway.

However, in Mavs-/- mice with genetic deficiency of the innate immune signaling adaptor MAVS, HAV replicates robustly in the absence of disease. The HAV 3ABC protease cleaves MAVS in human cells, thereby disrupting virus-induced IFN responses, but it cannot cleave murine MAVS (mMAVS) due to sequence differences at the site of scission. Here, we sought to elucidate the role of 3ABC MAVS cleavage in determining HAV pathogenesis and host species range.\nMethods: Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we established two independent lineages of C57BL/6 mice with knock-in mutations altering two amino acids in mMAVS (‘mMAVS-VS’), rendering it susceptible to 3ABC cleavage without loss of signaling function. We challenged homozygous Mavsvs/vs mice with HAV, and compared infection outcomes with C57BL/6 and genetically deficient Mavs-/- mice.\nResults: The humanized murine mMAVS-VS protein was cleaved as efficiently as human MAVS when co-expressed with 3ABC in Huh-7 cells. In embyronic fibroblasts from Mavsvs/vs mice, mMAVS-VS was cleaved by ectopically expressed 3ABC, significantly disrupting Sendai virus-induced IFN responses. However, in contrast to Mavs-/- mice with genetic MAVS deficiency, HAV failed to establish infection in Mavsvs/vs mice, even with additional genetic knockout of Trif or Irf1. Nonetheless, when crossed with permissive Ifnar1-/- mice lacking type I IFN receptors, Mavsvs/vsIfnar1-/- mice demonstrated enhanced viral replication coupled with significant reductions in serum alanine aminotransferase, hepatocellular apoptosis, and intrahepatic inflammatory cell infiltrates compared with Ifnar1-/- mice.\nConclusions: MAVS cleavage by 3ABC boosts viral replication and disrupts disease pathogenesis, but it is not by itself sufficient to break the host-species barrier to HAV infection in mice.\nImpact and implications: The limited host range of human hepatitis viruses could be explained by species-specific viral strategies that disrupt innate immune responses. Both hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis C virus express viral proteases that cleave the innate immune adaptor protein MAVS, in human but not mouse cells. However, the impact of this immune evasion strategy has never been assessed in vivo. Here we show that HAV 3ABC protease cleavage of MAVS enhances viral replication and lessens liver inflammation in mice lacking interferon receptors, but that it is insufficient by itself to overcome the cross-species barrier to infection in mice.

Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)–a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1663718400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663718400,"objectID":"455da2b40148077d874fdc3e3b8d6a08","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36130271/","publishdate":"2022-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36130271/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nTherapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer.

A 186-fold increase in BGC cells was present by week 10 compared with conventional immunization. Single-cell transcriptional profiling showed that both light- and dark-zone germinal centre states were sustained. Antibody somatic hypermutation of BGC cells continued to accumulate throughout the 29-week priming period, with evidence of selective pressure.

High titres of HIV-neutralizing antibodies were generated after a single booster immunization. Fully glycosylated HIV trimer protein is a complex antigen, posing considerable immunodominance challenges for B cells. Memory B cells generated under these long priming conditions had higher levels of antibody somatic hypermutation, and both memory B cells and antibodies were more likely to recognize non-immunodominant epitopes.

In pathologic states such as diabetes, macrophage plasticity is impaired, and macrophages remain in a persistent proinflammatory state; however, the reasons for this are unknown. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing of human diabetic wounds, we identified increased JMJD3 in diabetic wound macrophages, resulting in increased inflammatory gene expression. Mechanistically, we report that in wound healing, JMJD3 directs early macrophage-mediated inflammation via JAK1,3/STAT3 signaling. However, in the diabetic state, we found that IL-6, a cytokine increased in diabetic wound tissue at later time points post-injury, regulates JMJD3 expression in diabetic wound macrophages via the JAK1,3/STAT3 pathway and that this late increase in JMJD3 induces NFκB-mediated inflammatory gene transcription in wound macrophages via an H3K27me3 mechanism. Interestingly, RNA sequencing of wound macrophages isolated from mice with JMJD3-deficient myeloid cells (Jmjd3f/fLyz2Cre+) identified that the STING gene (Tmem173) is regulated by JMJD3 in wound macrophages. STING limits inflammatory cytokine production by wound macrophages during healing. However, in diabetic mice, its role changes to limit wound repair and enhance inflammation. This finding is important since STING is associated with chronic inflammation, and we found STING to be elevated in human and murine diabetic wound macrophages at late time points. Finally, we demonstrate that macrophage-specific, nanoparticle inhibition of JMJD3 in diabetic wounds significantly improves diabetic wound repair by decreasing inflammatory cytokines and STING.

Here, we investigated the roles of IFN-γ and IL-17A, key T-cell cytokines significantly elevated in patients with CRS, in the immunopathogenesis of CRS-induced extrapulmonary ALI. CRS was induced in wild-type (WT), IL-17A- and IFN-γ knockout (KO) human leukocyte antigen-DR3 transgenic mice with 10 μg of the superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, given intraperitoneally. Several ALI parameters, including gene expression profiling in the lungs, were studied 4, 24, or 48 hours later. Systemic T-cell activation with staphylococcal enterotoxin B resulted in robust upregulation of several chemokines, S100A8/A9, matrix metalloproteases, and other molecules implicated in tissue damage, granulocyte as well as agranulocyte adhesion, and diapedesis in the lungs as early as 4 hours, which was accompanied by subsequent neutrophil/eosinophil lung infiltration and severe ALI in IFN-γ KO mice. These pathways were significantly underexpressed in IL-17A KO mice, which manifested mildest ALI and intermediate in WT mice. Neutralization of IFN-γ worsened ALI in WT and IL-17A KO mice, whereas neutralizing IL-17A did not mitigate lung injury in IFN-γ KO mice, suggesting a dominant protective role for IFN-γ in ALI and that IL-17A is dispensable. Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, increased ALI severity in WT mice. Thus, our study identified novel mechanisms of ALI in CRS and its differential modulation by IFN-γ and IL-17A.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1663545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663545600,"objectID":"21a989bf54fb1b6db4aab67a3b470c4c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36125351/","publishdate":"2022-09-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36125351/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nThe mechanisms by which excessive systemic activation of adaptive T lymphocytes, as in cytokine release syndrome (CRS), leads to innate immune cell-mediated acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome, often in the absence of any infection, remains unknown.","tags":["Immunology","Tissue Injury","Inflammation","Lung"],"title":"IFN- γ Is Protective in Cytokine Release Syndrome-associated Extrapulmonary Acute Lung Injury","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nTranscriptionally silent chromatin often localizes to the nuclear periphery.

There is a dearth of drug applications that can be used to prevent cytokine storms in ARDS treatment. This study was designed to investigate the effects of tocilizumab and dexamethasone on oxidative stress, antioxidant parameters, and cytokine storms in acute lung injury caused by oleic acid in rats.\nMethods: Adult male rats were divided into five groups: the CN (healthy rats, n = 6), OA (oleic acid administration, n = 6), OA + TCZ-2 (oleic acid and tocilizumab at 2 mg/kg, n = 6), OA + TCZ-4 (oleic acid and tocilizumab at 4 mg/kg, n = 6), and OA + DEX-10 (oleic acid and dexamethasone at 10 mg/kg, n = 6) groups. All animals were euthanized after treatment for histopathological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, PCR, and SEM analyses.\nResults: Expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 cytokines in rats with acute lung injury induced by oleic acid were downregulated in the TCZ and DEX groups compared to the OA group (P \u0026lt; 0.05). The MDA level in lung tissues was statistically lower in the OA + TCZ-4 group compared to the OA group. It was further determined that SOD, GSH, and CAT levels were decreased in the OA group and increased in the TCZ and DEX groups (P \u0026lt; 0.05). Histopathological findings such as thickening of the alveoli, hyperemia, and peribronchial cell infiltration were found to be similar when lung tissues of the TCZ and DEX groups were compared to the control group.

However, the mechanism of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury remains unknown. In this study, we established a rat model of sepsis-associated lung injury using the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method, and investigated the therapeutic effects of LG on lung injury in rats with sepsis. In addition, the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury model rats were evaluated. Besides, untargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the regulation of metabolites in rats with sepsis-associated lung injury after LG treatment. Our results showed that LG could decrease the wet/dry (W/D) ratio in lung and the total cell count and total protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in septic model rats. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining showed that LG reduced the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells in lung. In addition, LG treatmment down-regulated the gene and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokins in lung tissue and BALF. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were increased and the level of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) was decreased in lung tissue homogenate in septic model rats after LG treament. Moreover, the numbers of apoptotic cells in lung were reduced and the activity of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) in BALF was decreased in septic model rats after LG treament.

Additionally, LPS induced a higher extent of the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Mechanistically, NKA α1 interacted with TLR4 and Lyn.

The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics disconnection attracts us to explore its anti-PF mechanism in view of the intestinal expression of anti-PF factors. In bleomycin-induced PF in mice, rectal administration of butyrate (500 mg/kg) exhibited a significant anti-PF effect, with a maximum plasma concentration largely lower than the minimum effective concentration (1 mM) at which butyrate inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory factors by lung epithelial cells and the production of extracellular matrix by lung fibroblasts. The rectal administration of butyrate significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the colons of PF mice, but showed no significant effect on the mRNA expression of HGF in the small intestines, lungs and livers. In colon epithelial cells, the monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHC) abrogated butyrate-induced expression of HGF, indicating that butyrate functions through entering into cells. Butyrate showed no significant effect on the histone acetylation in the promoter region of HGF, suggesting that it promotes HGF expression not by directly affecting the histone deacetylation of HGF but by other pathways. GW9662, the inhibitor of PPARγ, significantly attenuated the effect of butyrate to promote the mRNA expression of HGF. Butyrate was able to enhance the acetylation of PPARγ, and a targeted mutation of lysine at the position 240 (K240) of PPARγ markedly diminished the induction of butyrate on HGF expression, suggesting that butyrate promoted HGF expression in colon epithelial cells by upregulating PPARγ K240 acetylation. In summary, rectal administration of butyrate promotes the expression of HGF in colonic epithelial cells through upregulating PPARγ acetylation via inhibition of HDAC activity. The findings of the present study provide a reasonable explanation for the anti-PF action mode of butyrate based on the ’lung-gut axis’, and found that intestine-derived butyrate and HGF may be involved in the modulation of the occurrence and progression of PF.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1663286400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663286400,"objectID":"ee02c8a1c590a9ab2c6a8bbcb132f95f","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36116532/","publishdate":"2022-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36116532/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nButyrate, given by oral administration or in drinking water, has been shown to improve experimental pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in mice despite of very low bioavailability.

It is characterized by lytic cell death induced by the binding of intracellular LPS to caspases 4/5 in human cells and caspase-11 in mouse cells. In mice,caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis plays an important role in endotoxemia. HMGB1 released into the plasma binds to LPS and is internalized into lysosomes in endothelial cells via the advanced glycation end product receptor. In the acidic lysosomal environment, HMGB1 permeates the phospholipid bilayer, which is followed by the leakage of LPS into the cytoplasm and the activation of caspase-11. Heparin is an anticoagulant widely applied in the treatment of thrombotic disease. Previous studies have found that heparin could block caspase-11-dependent inflammatory reactions, decrease sepsis-related mortality, and reduce ALI, independent of its anticoagulant activity. Heparin or modified heparin with no anticoagulant property could inhibit the alarmin HMGB1-LPS interactions, minimize LPS entry into the cytoplasm, and thus blocking caspase-11 activation.

Astragaloside IV is a potential drug for prevention of PM2.5-induced respiratory disease. Abstract\nObjective: Exposure to PM2.5 will increase the risk of respiratory disease and increase the burden of social health care. Astragaloside Ⅳ (Ast-IV) is one of the main biologically active substances form Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus, which owns various pharmacological effects. Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by accumulation of iron-dependent lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is not clear whether there are typical features of ferroptosis in PM2.5-induced lung injury. This study investigates whether PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice has a special form of ferroptosis and the specific protective mechanism of Ast-IV.\nSubjects and methods: Forty-two male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 7 per group): NS group (normal saline), Ast group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg), PM2.5 group, Ast-L group (Ast-IV 50 mg/kg + PM2.5), Ast-H group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + PM2.5) and Era group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + erastin 20 mg/kg + PM2.5). Mice were pre-treated with Ast-IV intraperitoneally for three days. Then, PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) was given by non-invasive tracheal instillation to induce lung injury. The ferroptosis’ agonist erastin was used to verify the mechanism of Ast-IV anti-ferroptosis. 12 h after PM2.5 stimulation, the mice were euthanized. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum were collected for oxidative stress and cytokine determination. Lung tissues were collected for glutathione (GSH), tissue iron content, histology, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot analysis.\nResults: Ast-IV reduced the lung wet-dry ratio and the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in serum. Ast-IV could also improve the oxidative stress level in BALF, restore the GSH level in the lung tissue, and reduce the iron content in the lung tissue. Western blot outcomes revealed that Ast-IV regulated the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to protect PM2.5-mediated lung injury.\nConclusion: The protective effect of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice might be related to the inhibition of ferroptosis in lung tissue.

Linagliptin protects against PMVECs hyperpermeability via preventing the loss of adherens junctions and tight junctions. Linagliptin inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress by regulating mitochondrial function. Linagliptin attenuates PMVECs barrier dysfunction via activating the Epac1/AKT signaling axis. Abstract\nPulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) barrier dysfunction is a main pathophysiological feature of sepsis-related acute lung injury (ALI). This study aimed to investigate whether the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor linagliptin could protect against LPS-induced PMVECs barrier disruption and its underlying molecular mechanisms. A classical ALI animal model and LPS-treated PMVECs were applied and all were treated with or without linagliptin. Cellular experiments demonstrated that linagliptin could mitigate LPS-induced PMVECs hyperpermeability and intercellular junction (VE-cadherin, β-catenin, and ZO-1) disruption in a dose-dependent manner. Correspondingly, it was observed that linagliptin pretreatment distinctly relieved LPS-induced lung injury, oxidative stress, and pulmonary edema in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of oxidative stress by linagliptin may be achieved by reversing impaired mitochondrial function. Mechanistically, linagliptin administration promoted the activation of the Epac1 pathway and its downstream AKT pathway, while inhibition of the Epac1/Akt signaling pathway significantly alleviated the above-mentioned protective effect of linagliptin on the PMVECs barrier. Taken together, these data suggest that linagliptin can effectively reserve PMVECs barrier dysfunction and inhibit oxidative stress to protect against ALI via activating the Epac1/AKT signaling pathway, and thus may become a potential clinical therapeutic strategy for ALI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1663200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663200000,"objectID":"81f00889243c52f4d2b12c2b15967ac8","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36115114/","publishdate":"2022-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36115114/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nLinagliptin alleviates LPS-induced pulmonary injury and edema.

However, the function and mechanism of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the regulation of autophagy in ischemic AKI remain unexplored. Herein, we find that circ-ZNF609, originating from the ZNF609 locus, is highly expressed in the kidney after ischemia/reperfusion injury, and urinary circ-ZNF609 is a moderate predictor for AKI in heart disease patients. Overexpression of circ-ZNF609 can activate AKT3/mTOR signaling and induce autophagy flux impairment and cell apoptosis while inhibiting proliferation in HK-2 cells, which is blocked by silencing circ-ZNF609. Mechanistically, circ-ZNF609 encodes a functional protein consisting of 250 amino acids (aa), termed ZNF609-250aa, the overexpression of which can activate AKT3/mTOR signaling and induce autophagy flux impairment and cell apoptosis in HK-2 cells in vitro and in AKI kidneys in vivo. The blockade of AKT and mTOR signaling with pharmacological inhibitors is capable of reversing ZNF609-250aa-induced autophagy flux impairment and cell apoptosis in HK-2 cells. The present study demonstrates that highly expressed circ-ZNF609-encoded ZNF609-250aa induces cell apoptosis and AKI by impairing the autophagy flux via an AKT/mTOR-dependent mechanism. These findings imply that targeting circ-ZNF609 may be a novel therapy for ischemic AKI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1663113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663113600,"objectID":"01d20a670621a58b35aaf46b899017cc","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36110046/","publishdate":"2022-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36110046/","section":"article","summary":"Erratum in:\nA protein encoded by circular ZNF609 RNA induces acute kidney injury by activating the AKT/mTOR-autophagy pathway.\nAbstract\nAutophagy plays a crucial role in the development and progression of ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI).","tags":["Cell Death","Tissue Injury","RNA","non-coding RNAs","Kidney","Circular RNAs","Autophagy"],"title":"A protein encoded by circular ZNF609 RNA induces acute kidney injury by activating the AKT/mTOR autophagy pathway","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nBranching morphogenesis is a key process essential for lung and other organ development in which cellular and tissue architecture branch out to maximize surface area.

The results from the transcriptome and the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay reveal that this is partially regulated by the derepression of Bmp4, encoding bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4, which is a direct target of H2A.Z. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of BMP signaling by the protein inhibitor Noggin rescues the lung branching defects of Znhit1 mutants ex vivo.

Abstract\nThe imbalance of intestinal microbiota and inflammatory response is crucial in the development of lung injury induced by PM2.5. In recent years, probiotics have attracted great attention for their health benefits in inflammatory diseases and regulating intestinal balance, but their intricate mechanisms need further experiments to elucidate. In our research, a rat lung damage model induced by PM2.5 exposure in real environment was established to explore the protective properties of probiotics on PM2.5 exposure injury and its related mechanism. The results indicated that compared with the AF control group, rats in the PM2.5 group gained weight slowly, ate less and had yellow hair. The results of pathological and immunohistochemical examinations showed that the inflammatory infiltration of lung tissue was alleviated after probiotic treatment. The Lung function results also showed the improvement effects of probiotics administration. In addition, probiotics could promote the balance of Th17 and Treg cells, inhibit cytokines expression (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17A), and increase the concentration of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10, TGF-β). In addition, 16 S rRNA sequence analysis showed that probiotic treatment could reduce microbiota abundance and diversity, increase the abundance of possible beneficial bacteria, and decrease the abundance of bacteria associated with inflammation. In general, probiotic intervention was found to have preventive effects on the occurrence of PM2.5 induced pathological injury, and the mechanism was associate with to the inhibition of inflammatory response, regulation of Th17/Treg balance and maintenance of intestinal internal environment stability.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1663113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663113600,"objectID":"cded82420485b268af4792d71adf1928","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36115151/","publishdate":"2022-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36115151/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nPM2.5 exposure altered gut microbiome and influences the balance of Th17/Treg cell.

In this study, we investigate whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attenuate hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury by regulating FPR2 activity. We observed a significant increase in FPR2 levels in alveolar macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) after H2O2-induced stress, which decreased after MSC treatment.

We hypothesized that a murine model of mechanical ventilation-induced acute lung injury (VILI) would induce neural injury to the amygdala and hippocampus, brain regions that are implicated in diverse neuropsychiatric conditions, and corresponding delirium- and anxiety-like functional impairments. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these structural and functional changes would reverse with systemic IL-6 inhibition. VILI was induced using high tidal volume (35 cc/kg) mechanical ventilation. Cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) expression was quantified as a neural injury marker and found to be significantly increased in the VILI group compared to spontaneously breathing or anesthetized and mechanically ventilated mice with 10 cc/kg tidal volume. VILI mice treated with systemic IL-6 inhibition had significantly reduced amygdalar and hippocampal CC3 expression compared to saline-treated animals and demonstrated amelioration in acute neuropsychiatric behaviors in open field, elevated plus maze, and Y-maze tests.

We identify human CPEB4 as an RNA-binding protein (RBP) with enhanced association to poly(A) RNA upon inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), a condition known to cause widespread degradation of poly(A)-containing mRNA. Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) analysis using endogenously tagged CPEB4 in HeLa cells reveals that CPEB4 preferentially binds to the 3’UTR of immediate early gene mRNAs, at G-containing variants of the canonical U- and A-rich CPE located in close proximity to poly(A) sites.

Hence, the design of multifunctional biomaterials with haemostasis, postoperative wound management, and postoperative tissue adhesion prevention properties for nephron-sparing surgeries is urgently needed. In this study, a series of injectable adhesive multifunctional biocompatible hydrogels were designed based on the free-radical polymerisation of monomers acryloyl-6-aminocaproic acid (AA) and N-acryloyl 2-glycine (NAG), and the ionic coordination between Ca2+ and the abundant carboxyl groups in AA and NAG. AA/NAG/Ca (AA, NAG, and Ca refer to acryloyl-6-aminocaproic acid, N-acryloyl 2-glycine and calcium chloride, respectively) hydrogel exhibited good mechanical properties, swelling and adhesion properties, flexibility, in vitro blood-clotting ability, and cytocompatibility. In vivo experiments on liver injury models and rat/rabbit nephron-sparing surgery models elucidated that the AA/NAG/Ca hydrogel had haemostasis performance and wound healing properties that led to short bleeding time, reduced bleeding volume, and well-organised nephron structures. An abdomen-caecum adhesion model indicated that the AA/NAG/Ca hydrogel showed excellent anti-adhesion properties. In summary, this multifunctional hydrogel exhibited potential for improving haemostasis and wound management in nephron-sparing surgeries, showing potential for clinical application.

The molecular clock that underlies circadian physiological function consists of a core group of transcription factors, including the protein PER1 (Period1).

Using male Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats with global knockout of PER1 (SSPer1-/-), we aim to test the hypothesis that PER1 plays a key role in the regulation of salt-sensitive blood pressure.\nMethods: The model was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 and was characterized using radiotelemetry and measures of renal function and circadian rhythm.\nResults: SSPer1-/- rats had similar mean arterial pressure when fed a normal 0.4% NaCl diet but developed augmented hypertension after three weeks on a high-salt (4% NaCl) diet. Despite being maintained on a normal 12:12 light:dark cycle, SSPer1-/- rats exhibited desynchrony mean arterial pressure rhythms on a high-salt diet, as evidenced by increased variability in the time of peak mean arterial pressure.

Rats were instilled with PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) suspension intratracheally, while rosavin (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) was delivered by intraperitoneal injection before the PM2.5 injection. It was observed that rosavin could prevent lung injury caused by PM2.5. PM2.5 showed obvious ferroptosis-related ultrastructural alterations, which were significantly corrected by rosavin. The pretreatment with rosavin downregulated the levels of tissue iron, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal, and increased the levels of glutathione. The expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was upregulated by rosavin, together with other ferroptosis-related proteins. RSL3, a specific ferroptosis agonist, reversed the beneficial impact of rosavin. The network pharmacology approach predicted the activation of rosavin on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway.

In this study, we investigated the role of SMPDL3b in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair in vitro and in vivo. We assessed the kinetics of DSBs recognition and repair along with the ATM pathway and nuclear sphingolipid metabolism in wild-type (WT) and SMPDL3b overexpressing (OE) human podocytes. We also assessed the extent of DNA damage repair in SMPDL3b knock-down (KD) human podocytes, and C57BL6 WT and podocyte-specific SMPDL3b-knock out (KO) mice after radiation injury. We found that SMPDL3b overexpression enhanced DSBs recognition and repair through modulating ATM nuclear shuttling. OE podocytes were protected against radiation-induced apoptosis by increasing the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and attenuating subsequent caspase-3 cleavage. SMPDL3b overexpression prevented radiation-induced alterations in nuclear ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and ceramide levels. Interestingly, exogenous C1P pretreatment radiosensitized OE podocytes by delaying ATM nuclear foci formation and DSBs repair. On the other hand, SMPDL3b knock-down, in vitro and in vivo, induced a significant delay in DSBs repair. Additionally, increased activation of apoptosis was induced in podocytes of SMPDL3b-KO mice compared to WT mice at 24 h post-irradiation.

A nanoemulsion (NE) formulation based on bioactive natural ingredients; rhamnolipid biosurfactant and tea-tree oil, was developed using a simple ultrasonication technique, optimized by varying oil concentration and surfactant:oil ratio. The selected TSIIA-NE formulation showed 105.7 nm diameter and a PDI ∼ 0.3. EE exceeded 98 % with biphasic sustained drug release and good stability over 3-months. In-vivo efficacy was evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model. TSIIA-NE (30 µg/kg) was administered once intratracheally 2 h after LPS instillation.

In recent years, there has been a growth in research on microautophagy, first in yeast and then in mammalian cells. Here we review this form of autophagy, focusing on selective forms of microautophagy. We also discuss the upstream regulatory mechanisms, the crosstalk between macroautophagy and microautophagy, and the functional implications of microautophagy in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders in humans. Future research into microautophagy will provide opportunities to develop novel interventional strategies for autophagy- and lysosome-related diseases.\n\u0026lt; Back to Reviews Alternative to Homepage ","date":1662940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662940800,"objectID":"a7a82f9ce3d1256a3e8105dc2f3820c0","permalink":"https://example.com/review/36097284/","publishdate":"2022-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/review/36097284/","section":"review","summary":"Abstract\n‘Autophagy’ refers to an evolutionarily conserved process through which cellular contents, such as damaged organelles and protein aggregates, are delivered to lysosomes for degradation.

Hedyotis diffusa is a traditional Chinese medicine for treating lung heat and its crude polysaccharides (HDP) exhibit significant anticomplement activity in vitro.\nPurpose: To obtain an anticomplement homogeneous polysaccharide from HDP and verify its therapeutic effect and mechanism on ALI.\nMethods: Diethylaminoethyl-52 (DEAE-52) cellulose and gel permeation columns were used to isolate a homogeneous polysaccharide HD-PS-3, which was then characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and methylation analysis. In vitro, the anticomplement activities of HD-PS-3 through classical and alternative pathways were determined using a hemolytic test. The therapeutic effects of HDP and HD-PS-3 on ALI were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intratracheal instilled mice. Hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026amp;E) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunohistochemical staining were used to assess histological changes, measure cytokine levels, and evaluate the degree of complement component 3c (C3c) deposition and neutrophil infiltration, respectively. ELISA, western blotting, and immunofluorescence were used to analyze neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation.\nResults: From HDP, 1.5 g of the homogeneous polysaccharide HD-PS-3 was obtained. HD-PS-3 was an acidic heteropolysaccharide with an acetyl group, which was composed of →4,6)-α-Glcp-(1→, →3,4)-α-Glcp-(1→, →4)-α-Glcp-(1→, →4,6)-α-Galp-(1→, →5)-α-Araf-(1→, α-Rhap-(1→, α-Araf-(1→, α-GlcpA-(1→, →4)-β-Manp-(1→, β-Manp-(1→ and →3)-β-Manp-(1→. The in vitro results suggest that HD-PS-3 exhibited anticomplement activity with CH50 and AP50 values of 115 ± 12 μg/ml and 307 ± 11 μg/ml, respectively. After confirming the efficacy of HDP (200 mg/kg) in attenuating lung injury, the effect of HD-PS-3 on ALI was also investigated. HD-PS-3 (75 and 150 mg/kg) attenuated LPS-induced ALI as well, evidenced by lung pathology, lung injury scores, protein concentration, leukocyte counts, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) contents in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Mechanistically, HD-PS-3 inhibited complement activation, manifested in reduced pulmonary C3c deposition in lung tissue and complement component 3a (C3a) content in BALF. Neutrophil recruitment was also reduced by HD-PS-3, with significantly reduced pulmonary neutrophil infiltration and lower levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in BALF. In addition, HD-PS-3 reduced the levels of MPO-DNA complex in BALF, decreased citrullinated histone H3 (Cit H3) expression and NET formation (colocalization of MPO, Cit H3, and DNA) in lung tissue.\nConclusion: An anticomplement homogeneous polysaccharide HD-PS-3 was isolated from H. diffusa. HD-PS-3 exhibited a therapeutic effect against ALI, and the mechanism might be related to its inhibitory effects on complement activation, neutrophil recruitment, and NET formation.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1662854400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662854400,"objectID":"39c79fc5aebcffa671466f9cb4f1a64e","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36116199/","publishdate":"2022-09-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36116199/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Owing to the involvement of the overactivated complement system in acute lung injury (ALI) development, anticomplement components may attenuate ALI.

To expand our previous observation of low USP13 expression in IPF, this study evaluated the role of USP13 in age-related lung fibrosis. Here, we demonstrated that Usp13-deficient aged mice exhibited impaired autophagic activity and increased vulnerability to bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Mechanistically, USP13 interacted with and deubiquitinated Beclin 1, and Beclin 1 overexpression abolished the effects of USP13 disruption. In addition, Beclin 1 inhibition resulted in insufficient autophagy and more severe lung fibrosis after bleomycin injury, consistent with the phenotype of aged Usp13-deficient mice. Collectively, we show a protective role of USP13 in age-related pulmonary fibrosis.

Here, using DC patient iPSCs, we show that mutations in the dyskerin N-terminal extension domain (NTE) dysregulate scaRNA13. In iPSCs carrying the del37L NTE mutation or engineered to carry NTE mutations via CRISPR/Cas9, but not in those with C-terminal mutations, we found scaRNA13 transcripts with aberrant 3’ extensions, as seen when the exoribonuclease PARN is mutated in DC.

Here, we found that patients with rs4946935 AA, located in Forkhead Box O3 (FOXO3) which is a well-known autophagic regulator, had a higher risk of hepatotoxicity than those with the GA or GG variant (OR = 18.020, 95%CI = 2.473 to 459.1784, P = 0.018) in a gefitinib-concentration dependent pattern.

This study reveals that FOXO3 mutation, leading to autophagic imbalance, plays important role in gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity, especially for patients with high concentration of gefitinib.

Here, we established a mouse model of high- and low-dose pH1N1 infection. We found that pH1N1 infection induced robust and early pathological damage and cytokine storm in an infection dose- and time-dependent manner. High-dose pH1N1 infection induced massive and sustained recruitment of neutrophils as well as a higher ratio of M1:M2, which may contribute to severe lung immunopathological damage. pH1N1 infection activated dose- and time-dependent STAT1 and STAT3. Inhibition of STAT1 and/or STAT3 aggravated low-dose pH1N1 infection, induced lung damage, and decreased survival rate. Appropriate activation of STAT1/3 provided survival benefits and pathological improvement during low-dose pH1N1 infection. These results demonstrate that high-dose pH1N1 infection induces robust and sustained neutrophil infiltration, imbalanced macrophage polarization, excessive and earlier cytokine storm, and STAT1/3 activation, which are associated with pulmonary dysregulated proinflammatory responses and progress of acute lung injury.

Furthermore, we highlighted the NEAT1 involvement in virtually all DDR processes through, at least, two different mechanisms. On one side NEAT1 positively regulates the posttranslational stabilization of essential PS proteins, which are involved in almost all DDR systems, thus increasing their availability within cells. On the other hand, NEAT1 plays a crucial role as a major regulator of a molecular axis that includes ATM and the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK kinase proteins, and their direct targets pRPA32 and pCHK2.

The results showed that melatonin treatment attenuated the loss of ganglion cell complex thickness, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and RGC after AOH injury, and improved the amplitudes of a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potentials in the electroretinogram. Additionally, the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells was decreased, and the upregulation of cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bad and downregulation of Bcl-2 and p-Bad were inhibited after melatonin administration.

EP3 deficiency curbed inflammatory cytokine release, neutrophil infiltration and serum high-mobility group box 1 levels, but additional TLR4 inhibition with TAK-242 did not offer further protection against the injury and inflammation. The protection of Ep3-/- was predominantly mediated by suppressing Mixed Lineage Kinase domain-Like-dependent necroptosis, resulting from the inhibition of cytokine generation and the switching of cell death modality from necroptosis to apoptosis through caspase-8 up-regulation, in part due to the restraint of IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling. EP3 deficiency failed to further alleviate the injury when necroptosis was inhibited. Ep3-/- in bone marrow-derived cells, particularly that in myeloid cells, protected kidneys to the same extent as that of global EP3 deletion. Thus, our results demonstrate that EP3 deficiency especially that on myeloid cells, ameliorates ischemic AKI via curbing inflammation and breaking the auto-amplification loop of necroinflammation. Hence, EP3 may be a promising target for the prevention and/or treatment of AKI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1662595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662595200,"objectID":"db734febdb6b62ffa96d1a126767de9c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36087809/","publishdate":"2022-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36087809/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nNecroinflammation plays an important role in disease settings such as acute kidney injury (AKI).

Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates were calculated by sex, country, world region and Human Development Index (HDI) for 185 countries. Age-specific rates were also estimated. The predicted number of cases and deaths in 2040 were calculated based on global demographic projections by HDI.\nResults: Over 1.9 million new CRC cases and 930 000 deaths were estimated in 2020. Incidence rates were highest in Australia/ New Zealand and European regions (40.6 per 100 000, males) and lowest in several African regions and Southern Asia (4.4 per 100 000, females). Similar patterns were observed for mortality rates, with the highest observed in Eastern Europe (20.2 per 100 000, males) and the lowest in Southern Asia (2.5 per 100 000, females).

The connection between these enduring changes and chronic disease remains poorly understood. We recently described the emergence of tuft cells within Krt5+ dysplastic regions after influenza injury. Using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, we characterized and delineated multiple distinct tuft cell populations that arise following influenza clearance. Distinct from intestinal tuft cells which rely on Type 2 immune signals for their expansion, neither IL-25 nor IL-4ra signaling are required to drive tuft cell development in dysplastic/injured lungs. In addition, tuft cell expansion occurred independently of type I or type III interferon signaling. Furthermore, tuft cells were also observed upon bleomycin injury, suggesting that their development may be a general response to severe lung injury. While intestinal tuft cells promote growth and differentiation of surrounding epithelial cells, in the lungs of tuft cell deficient mice, Krt5+ dysplasia still occurs, goblet cell production is unchanged, and there remains no appreciable contribution of Krt5+ cells into more regionally appropriate alveolar Type 2 cells. Together, these findings highlight unexpected differences in signals necessary for murine lung tuft cell amplification and establish a framework for future elucidation of tuft cell functions in pulmonary health and disease.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1662595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662595200,"objectID":"7080ab357f4c134c93eb071f0e57a954","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36073526/","publishdate":"2022-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36073526/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nWhile the lung bears significant regenerative capacity, severe viral pneumonia can chronically impair lung function by triggering dysplastic remodeling.

Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), a hallmark of lysosome-related diseases, can be triggered by diverse cellular stressors. Given the damaging contents of lysosomes, LMP must be rapidly resolved, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using an unbiased proteomic approach, we show that LMP stimulates a phosphoinositide-initiated membrane tethering and lipid transport (PITT) pathway for rapid lysosomal repair. Upon LMP, phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase type 2α (PI4K2A) accumulates rapidly on damaged lysosomes, generating high levels of the lipid messenger phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. Lysosomal phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate in turn recruits multiple oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein (ORP) family members, including ORP9, ORP10, ORP11 and OSBP, to orchestrate extensive new membrane contact sites between damaged lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum. The ORPs subsequently catalyse robust endoplasmic reticulum-to-lysosome transfer of phosphatidylserine and cholesterol to support rapid lysosomal repair. Finally, the lipid transfer protein ATG2 is also recruited to damaged lysosomes where its activity is potently stimulated by phosphatidylserine. Independent of macroautophagy, ATG2 mediates rapid membrane repair through direct lysosomal lipid transfer.

Herein, we aim to explore whether RCAN1 involves in mitochondrial dysfunction in AKI and the exact mechanism. In present study, AKI was induced by I/R and cisplatin in RCAN1flox/flox mice and mice with renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs)-specific deletion of RCAN1. The role of RCAN1 in hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) and cisplatin-induced injury in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2 was also examined by overexpression and knockdown of RCAN1. Mitochondrial function was assessed by transmission electron microscopy, JC-1 staining, MitoSOX staining, ATP production, mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay, Annexin V-FITC staining and Western blotting analysis of apoptosis-related proteins. It was found that protein expression of RCAN1 was markedly upregulated in I/R- or cisplatin-induced AKI mouse models, as well as in HR models in HK-2 cells. RCAN1 deficiency significantly reduced kidney damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell apoptosis, whereas RCAN1 overexpression led to the opposite phenotypes. Our in-depth mechanistic exploration demonstrated that RCAN1 increases the phosphorylation of mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) by binding to downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), then promotes dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) migration to mitochondria, ultimately leads to excessive mitochondrial fission of renal TECs. In conclusion, our study suggests that RCAN1 could induce mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis by activating the downstream JNK/Mff signaling pathway. RCAN1 may be a potential therapeutic target for conferring protection against I/R- or cisplatin-AKI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1662508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662508800,"objectID":"c481f4dcae6f7fc2f27c98aac507a639","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36071051/","publishdate":"2022-09-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36071051/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nIschemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced acute kidney injury (AKI), characterized by excessive mitochondrial damage and cell apoptosis, remains a clinical challenge.

We demonstrate that ABCC1 deficiency exacerbated cGAS-dependent autoimmunity in the Trex1-/- mouse model of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.

However, the role of neutrophil pyroptosis in sepsis and the mechanisms remains elusive. We find that N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), an acetyltransferase responsible for the N4-acetylation of Cytidine (ac4C) in mRNA, is significantly downregulated in neutrophils from septic mice. Neutrophil-specific over-expression of NAT10 improves the survival and ameliorates lung injury in septic mice by inhibiting neutrophil pyroptosis. Notably, UNC-52-like kinase 1 (ULK1) is identified as the target of NAT10 in neutrophils. The decreased expression of NAT10 resultes in the decay of ULK1 transcripts and therefore the reduced expression of ULK1. As a regulator of STING phosphorylation, the loss of ULK1 enhances the activation of STING-IRF3 signaling and subsequently the elevated pyroptosis-inducing NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils. While over-expression of NAT10 restrains pyroptosis in neutrophils as well as septic lethality in mice by reversing the ULK1-STING-NLRP3 axis. The decreased expression of NAT10 are also observed in sepsis patients and its correlation with clinical severity is found. Collectively, our findings disclose that NAT10 is a negative regulator of neutrophil pyroptosis and its downregulation contributes to the progress of sepsis by exacerbating pyroptosis via the ULK1-STING-NLRP3 axis, therefore revealing a potential therapeutic target for sepsis.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1662422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662422400,"objectID":"d89ed1d6acb4ecb9eff253efb0380d8b","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36068299/","publishdate":"2022-09-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36068299/","section":"article","summary":"Erratum in:\nAuthor Correction: NAT10 regulates neutrophil pyroptosis in sepsis via acetylating ULK1 RNA and activating STING pathway.\nAbstract\nEmerging evidence suggests that pyroptosis is involved in sepsis.

The aim of our present study was to investigate the effects of cGAS on lung I/R injury via regulating ERS.\nMethods: We used Sprague-Dawley rats to make the lung I/R model by performing left hilum occlusion-reperfusion surgery. cGAS-specific inhibitor RU.521, STING agonist SR-717, and 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), the ERS inhibitor, were intraperitoneally administered in rats. Double immunofluorescent staining was applied to detect the colocalization of cGAS or BiP, an ERS protein, with alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECIIs) marker. We used transmission electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructure of ER and mitochondria. Apoptosis and oxidative stress in the lungs were assessed, respectively. The profiles of pulmonary edema and lung tissue injury were evaluated.

After cGAS-STING pathway was inhibited or activated in lung I/R rats, the ERS was alleviated after cGAS was inhibited, while when STING was activated after lung I/R, ERS was aggravated in the AECIIs, these results suggested that cGAS-STING pathway might trigger ERS responses. Furthermore, activation of cGAS-STING pathway induced increased apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress via regulating ERS and therefore resulted in pulmonary edema and pathological injury in the lungs of I/R rats.

Variations in the genes or expression levels of the FHRs are also associated with glomerular disease, although the mechanisms of glomerular protection/injury are incompletely understood. To explore the role of the FHRs on complement regulation/dysregulation in the kidney, we expressed and purified recombinant murine FHRs (FHRs A, B, C and E). These four distinct FHRs contain binding regions with high amino acid sequence homology to binding regions within Factor H, but we observed different interactions of the FHRs with Factor H binding ligands, including heparin and C3d. There was differential binding of the FHRs to the resident kidney cell types (mesangial, glomerular endothelial, podocytes, and tubular epithelial). All four FHRs caused complement dysregulation on kidney cell surfaces in vitro, although the magnitude of the effect differed among the FHRs and also varied among the different kidney cells. However, only FHR E caused glomerular complement dysregulation when injected in vivo but did not exacerbate injury when injected into mice with ischemic acute kidney injury, an alternative pathway-mediated model.

Several clinical and experimental studies have suggested that the glycocalyx is an early target of endothelial injury during an infection. Colivelin, a synthetic derivative of the mitochondrial peptide humanin, has displayed cytoprotective effects in oxidative conditions. In the current study, we aimed to determine the potential therapeutic effects of colivelin in endothelial dysfunction and outcomes of sepsis in vivo. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a clinically relevant model of polymicrobial sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and were treated with vehicle or colivelin (100-200 µg/kg) intraperitoneally at 1 h after CLP. We observed that vehicle-treated mice had early elevation of plasma levels of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and P-selectin, the angiogenetic factor endoglin and the glycocalyx syndecan-1 at 6 h after CLP when compared to control mice, while levels of angiopoietin-2, a mediator of microvascular disintegration, and the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, an enzyme implicated in clearance of endotoxins, raised at 18 h after CLP. The early elevation of these endothelial and glycocalyx damage biomarkers coincided with lung histological injury and neutrophil inflammation in lung, liver, and kidneys. At transmission electron microscopy analysis, thoracic aortas of septic mice showed increased glycocalyx breakdown and shedding, and damaged mitochondria in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Treatment with colivelin ameliorated lung architecture, reduced organ neutrophil infiltration, and attenuated plasma levels of syndecan-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α and interleukin-10. These therapeutic effects of colivelin were associated with amelioration of glycocalyx density and mitochondrial structure in the aorta. At molecular analysis, colivelin treatment was associated with inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase in the aorta and lung. In long-term outcomes studies up to 7 days, co-treatment of colivelin with antimicrobial agents significantly reduced the disease severity score when compared to treatment with antibiotics alone.

Blockade of CLEC5A attenuates P. aeruginosa-induced NETosis and lung injury, and simultaneous administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb with ciprofloxacin increases survival rate and decreases collagen deposition in the lungs of mice challenged with a lethal dose of P. aeruginosa. Thus, CLEC5A is a promising therapeutic target to reduce ventilator-associated lung injury and fibrosis in P. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"e869d731189f413f1fed2ade67677f4c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36048544/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36048544/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common nosocomial infections worldwide, and it frequently causes ventilator-associated acute pneumonia in immunocompromised patients.

Excessive iron induces ferroptosis by promoting the generation of both soluble and lipid ROS via an iron-dependent Fenton reaction and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzyme activity. Cytosolic glutathione peroxidase 4 (cGPX4) pairing with ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) and mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase 4 (mGPX4) pairing with dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) serve as two separate defense systems to detoxify lipid peroxidation in the cytoplasmic as well as the mitochondrial membrane, thereby defending against ferroptosis in cells under normal conditions. However, disruption of these defense systems may cause ferroptosis. Emerging evidence has revealed that ferroptosis plays an essential role in the development of diverse cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as hemochromatosis-associated cardiomyopathy, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, heart failure (HF), atherosclerosis, and COVID-19-related arrhythmias. Iron chelators, antioxidants, ferroptosis inhibitors, and genetic manipulations may alleviate the aforementioned CVDs by blocking ferroptosis pathways. In conclusion, ferroptosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of various CVDs and suppression of cardiac ferroptosis is expected to become a potential therapeutic option.

However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear.\nPurpose: Elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism by which ZTOI acts against ALI in rats using an ingredients-targets-pathways (I-T-P) interaction network.\nStudy design and methods: The key ingredients of ZTOI were characterized using UPLC-MS/MS combined with literature mining. The target profiles of each ingredient were established using drug-target databases. The anti-inflammatory activity of ZTOI against lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced rat ALI was validated using histopathology and inflammatory factor assessments. The therapeutic targets of ZTOI were screened by integrating transcriptomic results of lung tissues with protein-protein interaction (PPI) expansion. Using KEGG pathway enrichment, an I-T-P network was established to determine the essential interactions among ingredients, targets, and pathways of ZTOI against lung inflammation in ALI. Molecular docking and immunofluorescence staining were utilized to confirm the accuracy of the I-T-P network.\nResults: A total of 11 sesquiterpenes, whose target profiles may characterize the potential function of ZTOI, were identified as key ingredients. In the ALI rat model, ZTOI can alleviate lung inflammation by decreasing the levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α both in serum and lung tissues. Based on our biological samples, transcriptomics, PPI network expansion, and KEGG pathway enrichment, 11 ingredients, 174 targets, and 8 signaling pathways were linked in the I-T-P networks. From these results, ZTOI could be inferred to exert multiple anti-inflammatory effects against ALI through Toll-like receptor, NF-kappa B, RIG-I-like receptor, TNF, NOD-like receptor, IL-17, MAPK, and the Toll and Imd signaling pathways. In addition, two significantly regulated targets in the transcriptome, Usp18 and Map3k7, could be the essential anti-inflammatory targets of ZTOI.\nConclusion: By integrating network pharmacology with ingredient identification and transcriptomics, we show the multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms by which ZTOI acts against ALI on an I-T-P level.

A bacterial infection combined with a preceding viral infection, known as superinfection, leads to worse outcomes than a single infection. Most of the pulmonary infection literature focuses on the changes in immune responses to bacteria between homeostatic and virally infected lungs. However, it is unclear how much of an influence bacterial virulence factors have in single or superinfection. Staphylococcal species express a broad range of cell wall-anchored proteins (CWAs) that have roles in host adhesion, nutrient acquisition, and immune evasion. We screened the importance of these CWAs using mutants lacking individual CWAs in vivo in both bacterial pneumonia and influenza superinfection. In bacterial pneumonia, the lack of individual CWAs leads to various decreases in bacterial burden, lung damage, and immune infiltration into the lung. However, the presence of a preceding influenza infection partially abrogates the requirement for CWAs. In the screen, we found that the uncharacterized CWA S. aureus surface protein D (SasD) induced changes in both inflammatory and homeostatic lung markers. We further characterized a SasD mutant (sasD A50.1) in the context of pneumonia. Mice infected with sasD A50.1 have decreased bacterial burden, inflammatory responses, and mortality compared to wild-type S. aureus. Mice also have reduced levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), likely derived from macrophages. Reductions in IL-1β transcript levels as well as increased macrophage viability point at differences in cell death pathways. These data identify a novel virulence factor for S. aureus that influences inflammatory signaling within the lung.\nImportance\nStaphylococcus aureus is a common commensal bacterium that can cause severe infections, such as pneumonia. In the lung, viral infections increase the risk of staphylococcal pneumonia, leading to combined infections known as superinfections. The most common virus associated with S. aureus pneumonia is influenza, and superinfections lead to worse patient outcomes than either infection alone. While there is much known about how the immune system differs between healthy and virally infected lungs, the role of bacterial virulence factors in single and superinfection is less understood.

PM2.5 exposure led to lung pathological changes in mouse model via autophagy. IL24 was identified as a potential target associated with PM2.5-induced autophagy. L24 was regulated by inhibition of mTOR. Abstract\nBackground: Evidence suggests that exposure to PM2.5 increased hospitalization and mortality rates of respiratory diseases. However, the potential biomarkers and targets associated with PM2.5-induced lung dysfunction are not fully discovered.\nMethods: Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and HALLMARK enrichment analysis of the RNA-seq data (Beas-2B cells treated with PM2.5) were applied. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify the biological processes correlated with autophagy. Three gene expression profile datasets (GSE158954, GSE155616 and GSE182199) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify the potential targets. PM2.5-exposed mice were constructed. Real-time qPCR, siRNA transfection, western blot, immunofluorescence, and pathological staining were applied for validation both in vitro and in vivo studies.\nResults: GO, KEGG and HALLMARK enrichment based on RNA-seq data showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were associated with autophagy like lysosome and macroautophagy. GSEA analysis revealed that PM2.5 was positively correlated with autophagy-related biological processes compared with control group. Venn diagrams identified IL24 was upregulated in our data as well as in these three datasets (GSE158954, GSE155616 and GSE182199) after PM2.5 exposure. Consistent with the analysis, activation of autophagy by PM2.5 was validated in vivo and in vitro. In PM2.5-exposed mice, lung pathological changes were observed, including airway inflammation and mucus secretion. The mRNA and protein levels of the key gene, IL24, were significantly increased.

It has been recently proposed that scores of hyperconserved 5’ untranslated regions (UTRs), also known as transcript leaders (hTLs), encode internal ribosome entry sites (IRESes) that drive cap-independent translation, in part, via interactions with ribosome expansion segments. However, the direct functional significance of such interactions has not yet been definitively demonstrated. We provide evidence that the putative IRESes previously reported in Hox gene hTLs are rarely included in transcript leaders. Instead, these regions function independently as transcriptional promoters. In addition, we find the proposed RNA structure of the putative Hoxa9 IRES is not conserved. Instead, sequences previously shown to be essential for putative IRES activity encode a hyperconserved transcription factor binding site (E-box) that contributes to its promoter activity and is bound by several transcription factors, including USF1 and USF2. Similar E-box sequences enhance the promoter activities of other putative Hoxa gene IRESes. Moreover, we provide evidence that the vast majority of hTLs with putative IRES activity overlap transcriptional promoters, enhancers, and 3’ splice sites that are most likely responsible for their reported IRES activities. These results argue strongly against recently reported widespread IRES-like activities from hTLs and contradict proposed interactions between ribosomal expansion segment ES9S and putative IRESes.

Here we explored the transcriptomic profiles of lncRNAs in primary CRC tissues and corresponding paired adjacent non-tumor tissues by RNA-seq and found that LINC00239 was significantly overexpressed in colorectal cancer tissues.

Recent work demonstrates that monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (moAMs) drive lung fibrosis, but further characterization of critical moAM cell attributes is necessary.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have been suggested to play a major role in liver fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), an NAD+ -dependent deacetylase, has been previously implicated in the regulation of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-SMAD3 pathway that plays a significant role in liver fibrosis. In this work, we aimed to identify other important players during hepatic fibrogenesis, which are modulated by SIRT6. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ or WWTR1), key players in the Hippo pathway, have been implicated in the promotion of hepatic fibrosis. Our data show that HSC-specific Sirt6 knockout mice are more susceptible to high-fat-cholesterol-cholate diet-induced hepatic fibrosis than their wildtype counterparts. Our signaling analyses suggest that in addition to the TGFβ-SMAD3 pathway, YAP and TAZ are also highly activated in the SIRT6-deficient HSCs. As it is not clear how SIRT6 might regulate YAP and TAZ, we have decided to elucidate the mechanism underlying the regulation of YAP and TAZ by SIRT6 in HSCs. Overexpression or knockdown of SIRT6 corroborates the role of SIRT6 in the negative regulation of YAP and TAZ. Further biochemical analyses reveal that SIRT6 deacetylates YAP and TAZ and reprograms the composition of the TEA domain transcription factor complex to suppress their downstream target genes, particularly those involved in hepatic fibrosis. In conclusion, our data suggest that SIRT6 plays a critical role in the regulation of the Hippo pathway to protect against hepatic fibrosis.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1661731200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661731200,"objectID":"e8f55951cd8b4ec3f98c3704c4eeeef0","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36036554/","publishdate":"2022-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36036554/","section":"article","summary":"Erratum in:\nErratum to Sirtuin 6 protects against hepatic fibrogenesis by suppressing the YAP and TAZ function.\nAbstract\nHepatic fibrosis occurs in response to prolonged tissue injury in the liver, which results in abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix.","tags":["Tissue Injury","Liver","Acetylation","Hippo"],"title":"Sirtuin 6 protects against hepatic fibrogenesis by suppressing the YAP and TAZ function","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nSilicosis is one of the severest occupational diseases worldwide, manifesting as infiltration of inflammatory cells, excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and pulmonary diffuse fibrosis.

Here we further identified that vitamin D attenuated silica particles-induced lung inflammation by regulating macrophage polarization in a KLF4-STAT6 manner.

Primary macrophages purified from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of wildtype or Stat6 cKO mice and differentiated THP-1 cells were used for in vitro studies.

Mechanismly, vitamin D upregulated KLF4 expression in the alveolar macrophage, which synergistically activated STAT6. Additionally, KLF4 was found to upregulate macrophages autophagy, which protected them from silica particles-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis.

In the present study, we found a nucleolar protein NOC4L, human ortholog of yeast Noc4p, which is essential for the nuclear export of the ribosomal 40S subunit and could bind to SIRT1 to inhibit SIRT1 mediated deacetylation of p53. NOC4L interacts with SIRT1 in variety of cells under nucleolar stress and directly interacts with SIRT1 in vitro. Furthermore, we determined the C-terminal of NOC4L and the catalytic domain of SIRT1 were required for their interaction. Overexpression of NOC4L did not change the protein levels of SIRT1 or p53, but increased the acetylation of p53 and promoted cell apoptosis. Additionally, NOC4L inhibited tumor cell proliferation in a p53-dependent manner and restrained tumor growth in a nude mice xenograft model. Clinically, colorectal cancer patients with the high expression of NOC4L had a better prognosis as TP53 was normally expressed, but no significant difference was observed in survival with mutant TP53.

Patients with GBM assigned to C1 were characterized by shortened overall survival, higher suppressive immune infiltration levels, and lower stemness indices. We further constructed a risk scoring model to quantify the regulatory patterns of anoikis-related genes. The higher risk score group was characterized by a poor prognosis, the infiltration of suppressive immune cells and a differentiated phenotype, whereas the lower risk score group exhibited the opposite effects. In addition, patients in the lower risk score group exhibited a higher frequency of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations and a more sensitive response to immunotherapy.

Data were collected for REVEAL 2.0 (Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management) scores and outcome determinations. Patients were divided into the following REVEAL risk groups: low (≤6), medium (7-8), and high (≥9). Total cfDNA concentrations were compared among controls and PAH risk groups by 1-way analysis of variance. Log-rank tests compared survival between cfDNA tertiles and REVEAL risk groups. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were estimated from logistic regression models. A sample subset from cohort B (n=96) and controls (n=16) underwent bisulfite sequencing followed by a deconvolution algorithm to map cell-specific cfDNA methylation patterns, with concentrations compared using t tests.\nResults: In cohort A, median (interquartile range) age was 62 years (47-71), with 75% female, and median (interquartile range) REVEAL 2.0 was 6 (4-9). In cohort B, median (interquartile range) age was 59 years (49-71), with 69% female, and median (interquartile range) REVEAL 2.0 was 7 (6-9). In both cohorts, cfDNA concentrations differed among patients with PAH of varying REVEAL risk and controls (analysis of variance _P_≤0.002) and were greater in the high-risk compared with the low-risk category (_P_≤0.002).

Beauty activities can be considered as a major source of PAHs, 1-OHP and TTMA exposures. Abstract\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of chemical compounds which interest to human biological monitoring researches because of their potential carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic properties. However, the exposure of female beauticians to these contaminants is not well-reported. For biomonitoring of potential exposure of female cosmeticians to PAHs in beauty salons, urine samples were taken from cosmetologist women (n = 50.00) and housewives (n = 35.00) as the exposure group (EG) and control group (CG), respectively. Next, unmetabolized PAHs levels as well as the concentration of - 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) were analyzed in these specimens. In addition, since benzene has some common source with PAHs, in this study t, t’-Muconic acid (TTMA) level was also determined as the metabolite and indicator of exposure to benzene. The results indicated a high detection frequency of the target compounds (PAHs, 1-OHP and TTMA) in the urine specimens of beauticians. The results also showed that there is a significant difference between the concentration of these pollutants in the urine specimens of the exposure and control groups. The median concentration of ΣPAHs, 1-OHP, and TTMA in the before exposure (BE) specimens collected from the exposure group were 337.42 ng/L, 593.92 ng/L, and 247.90 μg/L, respectively. However, a higher concentration of these contaminants was observed in the after exposure specimens with a median concentration of 423.29 ng/L, 745.03 ng/L, and 310.97 μg/L, respectively. In terms of contribution of PAHs compounds in total toxic equivalents, DahA, BaP, and IndP with 59.03, 28.73, and 2.86 % had the largest share. In this study, it was also observed that some kidney damage biomarkers as well as some oxidative stress injury biomarkers are positively and significantly correlated with the urinary values of ∑PAHs.

However, their potential consequences in health and disease have not been fully elaborated. In this study, the effects of cefaclor, cefdinir and cefixime on intestinal microbiota and lung injury were investigated in Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn)-infected mice. The results showed that the proportion of coccus and bacillus in intestinal microbiota were changed after oral administration with cefaclor, cefdinir and cefixime twice for 10 days, respectively. Compared with the Spn-infected group, the proportion of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in intestine were significantly reduced, while Enterococcus and Candida was increased after cephalosporin treatment. Furthermore, 3 cephalosporins could obviously increase the number of total cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes in BALF as well as the serum levels of endotoxin, IL-2, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α.

In vivo, the effects of IF on ALI were evaluated in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine ALI model. We found that two times of 24-h fasting in a week before ALI efficiently ameliorated LPS-induced lung injury in mice, characterized by alleviated lung lesions, wet-to-dry weight ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde content, and lower levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β.

And PPARγ antagonist GW9662 and AMPK siRNA were used to test the role of PPARγ and AMPK in the IF-mediated improvement of ALI. The results showed that IF (serum deprivation) suppressed macrophage M1 activation and promoted M2 activation in LPS-treated BMDMs. While, IF also augmented macrophage M2 polarization in IL-4-treated BMDMs. Further mechanistic studies showed that the promotive effect of IF on M2 polarization was related to the activation of the PPARγ and AMPK pathways.

We define a regulatory role for the primate-specific long noncoding RNA CHROMR in coordinating ISG transcription. CHROMR sequesters the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-2/IRF2BP2 complex that restrains ISG transcription and thus is required to restrict influenza virus replication. These data identify a novel regulator of the antiviral gene program in humans and provide insights into the multilayered regulatory network that controls the innate immune response.\nAbstract\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression, yet their contribution to immune regulation in humans remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the primate-specific lncRNA CHROMR is induced by influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection and coordinates the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that execute antiviral responses. CHROMR depletion in human macrophages reduces histone acetylation at regulatory regions of ISG loci and attenuates ISG expression in response to microbial stimuli. Mechanistically, we show that CHROMR sequesters the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-2-dependent transcriptional corepressor IRF2BP2, thereby licensing IRF-dependent signaling and transcription of the ISG network.

Furthermore, we conducted computational integration of lipidomic with transcriptomic data. These analyses identified novel HFD-driven networks between glycerophospholipid metabolism and B cell receptor signaling with specific PUFA-derived pulmonary oxylipins. Finally, we confirmed the hypothesis by demonstrating that the concentration of pulmonary oxylipins, in addition to inflammatory markers, were generally increased in mice consuming a HFD upon ozone-induced acute lung injury.

Moreover, the modulation of Keap1 and Nrf2 as well as HO-1 upregulation by pyrogallol was reversed by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and a P38 kinase inhibitor (SB203580).

Additionally, we found that the induction of p62 by the pyrogallol-mediated ROS/P38/Nrf2 axis interacted with Keap1 and resulted in autophagic degradation of Keap1, which created a positive feedback loop to further release of Nrf2. Furthermore, the increased expression of HO-1 in pyrogallol-pretreated hUCMSCs led to enhanced inhibitory effects on LPS-mediated TLR4/P-P65 signaling in BEAS-2B cells, resulting in increasing suppression of LPS-indued expression of a series of pro-inflammatory mediators. Compared to untreated hUCMSCs, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with pyrogallol-primed hUCMSCs transplantation showed enhanced improvements in LPS-mediated lung pathological alterations, the increased lung index (lung/body ratio), apoptosis of epithelial cells, the activation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling as well as the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Together, these results suggested that hUCMSCs with pyrogallol pretreatment enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSCs, which may provide a promising therapeutic strategy to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSC-based therapy for treating LPS-associated ALI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1661299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661299200,"objectID":"4808c3b386843b5faf592d809b630b84","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36028178/","publishdate":"2022-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36028178/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nThe main challenges in clinical applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attributed to their heterogeneity.

Up to now, there is no effective treatment for wear particles-induced osteolysis except for the revision surgery, which is a heavy psychological and economic burden to patients. A metabolite of gut microbiota, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), has been reported to be beneficial for many chronic inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of SCFAs on osteolysis.\nMethods: A model of inflammatory osteolysis was established by applying CoCrMo alloy particles to mouse calvarium. After two weeks of intervention, the anti-inflammatory effects of SCFAs on wear particle-induced osteolysis were evaluated by Micro-CT analysis and immunohistochemistry staining. In vitro study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) primed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and Tohoku Hospital Pediatrics-1 (THP-1) macrophages were stimulated with CoCrMo particles to activate inflammasome in the presence of acetate (C2), propionate (C3), and butyrate (C4). Western blotting, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunofluorescence were used to detect the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The effects of SCFAs on osteoclasts were evaluate by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Additionally, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, agonists of GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A were applied to confirm the underlying mechanism of SCFAs on the inflammasome activation of macrophages and osteoclastogenesis.\nResults: C3 and C4 but not C2 could alleviate wear particles-induced osteolysis with fewer bone erosion pits (P \u0026lt; 0.001), higher level of bone volume to tissue volume (BV/TV, P \u0026lt; 0.001), bone mineral density (BMD, P \u0026lt; 0.001), and a lower total porosity (P \u0026lt; 0.001).

Thus, there is a clear need to discover novel drug targets to treat proteinuric kidney disease. We demonstrate that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a redox protein that forms the complex with antioxidant oxidoreductase thioredoxin (Trx), relocates from nucleus to mitochondria when C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a major endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated transcription factor, is induced by albuminuria. TXNIP shuttling to mitochondria is essential for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which oxidizes mitochondrial-specific Trx2 and disrupts the association between Trx2-TXNIP and Trx2-ASK1 in mitochondria, leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Thus, TXNIP is a potential target to treat NS.\nAbstract\nAlbuminuria is a hallmark of glomerular disease of various etiologies. It is not only a symptom of glomerular disease but also a cause leading to glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and eventually, a decline in kidney function. The molecular mechanism underlying albuminuria-induced kidney injury remains poorly defined. In our genetic model of nephrotic syndrome (NS), we have identified CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein)-TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting protein) as critical molecular linkers between albuminuria-induced ER dysfunction and mitochondria dyshomeostasis. TXNIP is a ubiquitously expressed redox protein that binds to and inhibits antioxidant enzyme, cytosolic thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), and mitochondrial Trx2. However, very little is known about the regulation and function of TXNIP in NS. By utilizing Chop-/- and Txnip-/- mice as well as 68Ga-Galuminox, our molecular imaging probe for detection of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo, we demonstrate that CHOP up-regulation induced by albuminuria drives TXNIP shuttling from nucleus to mitochondria, where it is required for the induction of mitochondrial ROS. The increased ROS accumulation in mitochondria oxidizes Trx2, thus liberating TXNIP to associate with mitochondrial nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) to activate inflammasome, as well as releasing mitochondrial apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) to induce mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Importantly, inhibition of TXNIP translocation and mitochondrial ROS overproduction by CHOP deletion suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation and p-ASK1-dependent mitochondria apoptosis in NS. Thus, targeting TXNIP represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NS.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1661126400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661126400,"objectID":"c40479cb5a8c4e66fbe2ce8de789bd0e","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35994650/","publishdate":"2022-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35994650/","section":"article","summary":"Significance\nAlbuminuria is the hallmark of nephrotic syndrome (NS), a leading cause of chronic kidney disease affecting 500 million people worldwide.

Here we identify CEP63 as an important mediator for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to facilitate regulation on their RNA targets in colorectal cancer (CRC). We demonstrate that CEP63 protein is upregulated in a large cohort of colorectal cancer tissues and predicts poor prognosis, and USP36 is identified for stabilizing CEP63 by enhancing its K48-dependent deubiquitination. CEP63 overexpression promotes the proliferation and tumor growth of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we find that CEP63 can promote cancer stem-like cell properties by enhancing YAP1 expression through binding with and inhibiting the K63-ubiquitylation degradation of RBP FXR1 in CRC cells. Importantly, we further verify that the KH domain of FXR1 is necessary for the interaction between CEP63 and FXR1. Moreover, microtube motor proteins can form a complex with CEP63 and FXR1 to mediate the regulation of FXR1 on RNA targets. Additionally, we also confirm that CEP63 can bind and regulate multiple RBPs. In conclusion, our findings unveil an unrecognized CEP63/RBPs/RNA axis that CEP63 may perform as an adapter facilitating the formation of RBPs complex to regulate RNA progression and discover the role of CEP63 involved in signal transduction and RNA regulation, providing potential therapeutic target for CRC patients.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1661126400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661126400,"objectID":"51c15de363da275090c96446c70b9582","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35989368/","publishdate":"2022-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35989368/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nAbnormal regulation of centrosome components can induce chromosome instability and tumorigenesis.

In vivo, GDF15 neutralization in a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model led to significantly less fibrosis. In vitro, recombinant GDF15 (rGDF15) stimulated α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression in NHLF, and this was mediated by the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) receptor. Furthermore, in the presence of rGDF15, the migration of NHLF in collagen gel was reduced. In addition, we observed a cell type-dependent effect of GDF15 on the expression of cell senescence markers.

Here, we report that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SNHG6 increases progression from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by modulating cholesterol-induced mTORC1 activation. Mechanistically, cholesterol binds ER-anchored FAF2 protein to promote the formation of a SNHG6-FAF2-mTOR complex. As a putative cholesterol effector, SNHG6 enhances cholesterol-dependent mTORC1 lysosomal recruitment and activation via enhancing FAF2-mTOR interaction at ER-lysosome contacts, thereby coordinating mTORC1 kinase cascade activation with cellular cholesterol biosynthesis in a self-amplified cycle to accelerate cholesterol-driven NAFLD-HCC development.

We previously identified ZER6 isoform p52-ZER6 as an oncogene upregulated in tumor tissues. In this study we investigated whether p52-ZER6 acted as a blocker of MDM2-p53 binding inhibitors, and whether p52-ZER6 could be used as a biomarker of MDM2-p53 binding inhibitors. In p53 wild-type colorectal carcinoma HCT116, hepatocarcinoma HepG2 and breast cancer MCF-7 cells, overexpression of p52-ZER6 enhanced MDM2-p53 binding and promoted p53 ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, overexpression of p52-ZER6 in the tumor cells dose-dependently reduced their sensitivity to both nutlin and non-nutlin class MDM2-p53 binding inhibitors. We showed that p52-ZER6 restored tumor cell viability, which was suppressed by nutlin-3, through restoring their proliferation potential while suppressing their apoptotic rate, suggesting that MDM2-p53 binding inhibitors might not be effective for patients with high p52-ZER6 levels. We found that nutlin-3 treatment or p52-ZER6 knockdown alone promoted the accumulation of p53 protein in the tumor cells, and their combinatorial treatment significantly increased the accumulation of p53 protein.

Of all the known health effects, lung injury is one of the most severe risks. However, little is known about the circRNAs related molecular mechanism in the development of lung injury induced by FA. This study was designed to explore the potential roles of dysregulated circRNAs as well as its mechanism in FA-induced lung injury. In the present study, 24 male SD rats were exposed to formaldehyde (control, 0.5, 2.46 and 5 mg/m3) for 8 h per day for 8 weeks to induce lung injury. We used H\u0026amp;E staining to evaluate the histopathological changes of lung injury indifferent groups. The expression of circRNAs in lung tissue was detected by real-time PCR. Meanwhile, circRNA/miRNA/mRNA interaction networks were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Our study revealed that formaldehyde exposure resulted in abnormal histopathological changes in lung tissues. Moreover, the expression of rno_circRNA_008646 was significantly higher in lung tissues of formaldehyde exposure rats than in control. Bioinformatics analysis showed that one potential target miRNA/mRNA for rno_circRNA_008646 was rno-miR-224/Forkhead Box I1 (FOXI1).

ChIP-qRT-PCR was used to detect the transcriptional activation of STEAP3-AS1 mediated by HIF-1α. RNA-seq, fluorescent in situ hybridization, RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and immunoblot experiments were used to ascertain the involved mechanisms. Functional assays were performed in both in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the regulatory role of STEAP3-AS1/STEAP3/Wnt/β-catenin axis in CRC proliferation and metastasis.\nResults: Here, we identified a hypoxia-induced antisense lncRNA STEAP3-AS1 that was highly expressed in clinical CRC tissues and positively correlated with poor prognosis of CRC patients. Upregulation of lncRNA STEAP3-AS1, which was induced by HIF-1α-mediated transcriptional activation, facilitated the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, STEAP3-AS1 interacted competitively with the YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2), a N6-methyladenosine (m6A) reader, leading to the disassociation of YTHDF2 with STEAP3 mRNA. This effect protected STEAP3 mRNA from m6A-mediated degradation, enabling the high expression of STEAP3 protein and subsequent production of cellular ferrous iron (Fe2+). Increased Fe2+ levels elevated Ser 9 phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and inhibited its kinase activity, thus releasing β-catenin for nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of Wnt signaling to support CRC progression.\nConclusions: Taken together, our study highlights the mechanisms of lncRNA STEAP3-AS1 in facilitating CRC progression involving the STEAP3-AS1/STEAP3/Wnt/β-catenin axis, which may provide novel diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets to benefit CRC treatment. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1α transcriptionally upregulates the expression of lncRNA STEAP3-AS1, which interacts competitively with YTHDF2, thus upregulating mRNA stability of STEAP3 and consequent STEAP3 protein expression. The enhanced STEAP3 expression results in production of cellular ferrous iron (Fe2+), which induces the Ser 9 phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β, releasing β-catenin for nuclear translocation and contributing to subsequent activation of Wnt signaling to promote CRC progression.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660867200,"objectID":"d52cf8f3f7859493c3cbbeccd650c906","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35986274/","publishdate":"2022-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35986274/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Hypoxia, a typical hallmark of solid tumors, exhibits an essential role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), in which the dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is frequently observed.","tags":["Wnt","Cancers","Intestine","lncRNAs","Signaling Pathway","RNA","non-coding RNAs"],"title":"Hypoxia-induced lncRNA STEAP3-AS1 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote colorectal cancer progression by preventing m6A-mediated degradation of STEAP3 mRNA","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nIncomplete repair after acute kidney injury can lead to development of chronic kidney disease.

However, the functions of Dot1L in the process of cardiac fibrosis still remain unknown.\nResults: In the present study, we found that endogenous Dot1L is upregulated in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) treated with angiotensin II (Ang II) or transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, along with elevated extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fibronectin, collagen I and III. Silencing or inhibiting Dot1L mitigated Ang II-induced myofibroblast generation and fibrogenesis. We identified the transcription factor-forkhead box O (FoxO) 3a as a novel substrate of Dot1L, the transcriptional activating mark H3K79me3 level on the promoter of FoxO3a was increase in activated-CFs, and inhibition of Dot1L markedly decreased FoxO3a transcription accompanied by a significant decrease in the expression of fibrogenic gene. Knockdown of FoxO3a could alleviate ECM deposition induced by Ang II, on the contrary, overexpression FoxO3a resulting in CFs activation. Consistently, in vivo Dot1L ablation rescued myocardial ischemia-induced cardiac fibrosis and improved cardiac function.\nConclusions: Our findings conclude that upregulation of Dot1L results in activation of the cardiac fibroblasts to promote profibrotic gene, eventually causes cardiac fibrosis.

We show that exosome cargo proteins bud from cells (i) in exosome-sized vesicles regardless of whether they are localized to plasma or endosome membranes, (ii) ∼5-fold more efficiently when localized to the plasma membrane, (iii) ∼5-fold less efficiently when targeted to the endosome membrane, (iv) by a stochastic process that leads to ∼100-fold differences in their abundance from one exosome to another, and (v) independently of small GTPase Rab27a, the ESCRT complex-associated protein Alix, or the cargo protein CD63.

We hypothesized that targeting an antioxidant to the mitochondria would prevent oxidative damage and attenuate EtOH-LPS-induced lung injury. To test this, we investigated the effects of mitochondria-targeted ubiquinone, Mitoquinone (MitoQ) on ethanol-sensitized lung injury induced by LPS.

The protective effects of MitoQ are associated with decreased cellular mitophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vivo and in vitro.

Abstract\nAcute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease characterized by severe inflammatory response, which has no pharmacological therapy in clinic. In this study, we found that eupalinolide B (EB), a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Eupatorium lindleyanum, significantly ameliorated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice, which manifests as reduction in lung injury score, activity of myeloperoxidase, and release of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In RAW264.7 murine macrophages, EB effectively inhibited LPS-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by down-regulating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), respectively. Mechanistically, EB not only blocked LPS-induced phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase-α/β (IKKα/β), phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B alpha (IκBα), and phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) P65, but also suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in vitro or in vivo. Through cellular thermal shift assay and western blotting, EB was demonstrated to target and inactivate transforming growth factor β activated kinase-1 (TAK1), which is an important upstream kinase for the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs pathways. Additionally, EB-mediated actions were markedly abolished by dithiothreitol in LPS-exposed RAW264.7 cells, suggesting a crucial role of the α,γ-unsaturated lactone for the anti-inflammatory activity of EB. In conclusion, our findings showed that EB could effectively alleviate ALI in mice, and attenuate inflammatory response by inhibiting the activation of TAK1, and TAK1-mediated activation of NF-κB and MAPKs cascades.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660780800,"objectID":"ce449d7735107daf89c5d6a37ba1bfd9","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35988521/","publishdate":"2022-08-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35988521/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nEupalinolide B (EB) inhibit LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice.

Here, we report profiling of invasive and noninvasive fibroblasts from IPF patients and healthy donors. Pathway analysis revealed that the activated signatures of the invasive fibroblasts, the top of which was ERBB2 (HER2), showed great similarities to those of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells. Activation of HER2 in normal lung fibroblasts led to a more invasive genetic program and worsened fibroblast invasion and lung fibrosis, while antagonizing HER2 signaling blunted fibroblast invasion and ameliorated lung fibrosis.

We investigated whether ischaemic cells can release microvesicles (MVs) and promote neovascularization in a model of peripheral artery disease (PAD).\nMethods and results: To model PAD, we used an in vivo experimental model of hind-limb ischaemia (HLI) in mice. MVs were isolated from the ischaemic muscle and from peripheral blood at different times after unilateral femoral artery ligation. MVs were phenotypically characterized to identify cell origin. HLI in mice induced the release of MVs with a much higher content of tissue factor (TF) than non-HLI control mice both in the MVs isolated from the affected limb muscle area and from blood. MVs were mainly released from endothelial cells (ECs) and induced Mo differentiation to endothelial cell-like (ECL) cells. Differentiation to ECL cells encompassed highly strict hierarchical transcription factor activation, initiated by ETS1 activation. MVs secreted by microvascular ECs over-expressing TF (upTF-EMVs), were injected in the ischaemic hind-limb in parallel with control EMVs (from random siRNA-treated cells) or EMVs released by silenced TF ECs. In animals treated with upTF-EMVs in the ischaemic zone, there was a highly significant increase in functional new vessels formation (seen by magnetic resonance angiography), a concomitant increase in the pool of circulating Ly6Clow Mo expressing vascular EC markers, and a significantly higher number of Mo/macrophages surrounding and integrating the newly formed collaterals.\nConclusion: Ischaemia-activated ECs release EMVs rich in TF that induce monocyte differentiation into ECL cells and the formation of new vessels in the ischaemic zone.

In addition, high LINC00941 expression was associated with a poor prognosis. Functional experiments and mice models were respectively used to evaluate PC cell proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo. The results suggested that LINC00941 overexpression promoted PC proliferation and metastasis. Subsequently, RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry (MS), and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) were performed to identify LINC00941-interacting proteins. The results suggested that ANXA2 was the potential LINC00941-interacting protein. Nucleotides 500-1390 of LINC00941 could bind to the Annexin 1 domain of ANXA2. LINC00941-mediated malignant phenotype of PC was reversed by ANXA2 depletion. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by MS was conducted to determine the potential interacting protein of LINC00941. The results illustrated that NEDD4L, an E3 ligase involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, bound to the Annexin 1 domain of ANXA2 and promoted its degradation. Mechanically, LINC00941 functioned as a decoy to bind to ANXA2 and suppressed its degradation by enclosing the domain that binds to NEDD4L. Eventually, LINC00941 upregulated ANXA2 and activated FAK/AKT signaling, increasing PC cell proliferation and metastasis. This study indicates that LINC00941 promotes PC proliferation and metastasis by binding ANXA2 and potentiating its stability, leading to the activation of FAK/AKT signaling.

ARDS is associated with alveolar damage and pulmonary edema that severely impair gas exchange, leading to hypoxia. With no existing FDA-approved treatment for ARDS, it is important to understand the factors that lead to virus-induced ARDS development to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We have previously shown that mice deficient in the serine-threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase, Tpl2 (MAP3K8 or COT), succumb to infection with a typically low-pathogenicity strain of influenza A virus (IAV; HKX31, H3N2 [x31]). The goal of the current study was to evaluate influenza A virus-infected Tpl2-/- mice clinically and histopathologically to gain insight into the disease mechanism. We hypothesized that Tpl2-/- mice succumb to IAV infection due to development of ARDS-like disease and pulmonary dysfunction. We observed prominent signs of alveolar septal necrosis, hyaline membranes, pleuritis, edema, and higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the lungs of IAV-infected Tpl2-/- mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice from 7 to 9 days postinfection (dpi). Notably, WT mice showed signs of regenerating epithelium, indicative of repair and recovery, that were reduced in Tpl2-/- mice. Furthermore, biomarkers associated with human ARDS cases were upregulated in Tpl2-/- mice at 7 dpi, demonstrating an ARDS-like phenotype in Tpl2-/- mice in response to IAV infection.\nImportance\nThis study demonstrates the protective role of the serine-threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase, Tpl2, in influenza virus pathogenesis and reveals that host Tpl2 deficiency is sufficient to convert a low-pathogenicity influenza A virus infection into severe influenza disease that resembles ARDS, both histopathologically and transcriptionally. The IAV-infected Tpl2-/- mouse thereby represents a novel murine model for studying ARDS-like disease that could improve our understanding of this aggressive disease and assist in the design of better diagnostics and treatments. \u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660780800,"objectID":"15841436833d4cc86949d9a1c88b9a53","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35980186/","publishdate":"2022-08-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35980186/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nExcessive inflammation in patients with severe influenza disease may lead to acute lung injury that results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Vit-D enhanced miRNA-149-5p when overexpressed, inhibited ER-specific ATF6 inflammatory pathway in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and improved histoarchitecture of the lung in LPS/CLP-induced mice models. This vitro and vivo studies demonstrate that Vit-D could improve ALI induced by CLP/LPS. In this regard, miR-149-5p may play a crucial role in vitamin-D inhibiting LPS/CLP induce ALI. The mechanism might be an association of increased miR-149-5p and its regulated gene target ATF6, and downstream CHOP proteins were suppressed. Thus, these findings demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory effect of Vit-D is achieved by augmentation of miRNA-149-5p expression, which may be a key physiologic mediator in the prevention and treatment of ALI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660780800,"objectID":"fc3b9aaa257dd6c70d4742eab370d7ad","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35988833/","publishdate":"2022-08-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35988833/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nAcute lung injury is a life-threatening medical problem induced by sepsis or endotoxins and may be associated with enhanced Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress).

We found that SP100-AS1 (lncRNA targeting antisense sequence of SP100 gene) was upregulated in radioresistant CRC patient tissues using RNA-seq analysis.

Endothelial injury is critical for the initiation and progression of severe acute pancreatitis-related acute lung injury. The beneficial effects of acadesine may involve reducing ROS accumulation and inhibiting apoptosis. Acadesine inhibits the impairment of SAP-ALI by activating the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway. Abstract\nSevere acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a condition characterized by highly fatal acute inflammation and is usually associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Acute lung injury (ALI) is the most common complications of SAP, which is the accelerator of other organ dysfunction caused by SAP and the primary cause of early death due to SAP. Acadesine, an adenosine analog and an AMPK activator, has been discovered to modulate glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS. However, its role in SAP-ALI and its mechanism remains unclear and need to be explored. Herein, we discovered that acadesine mitigated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), alleviated apoptosis and recovered barrier integrity, thereby contributing to anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Nrf2 deficiency partially eliminated the effects of acadesine-induced antioxidant effects and thus weakened the protective effects on cells and Nrf2-knockout (Nrf2-/-) mice. This study demonstrates that acadesine attenuated SAP-ALI associated inflammation and tissue damage by modulating the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway by triggering AMPK. These findings are of great significance for the treatment of SAP-related lung injury.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660694400,"objectID":"7c8f518c38dc07ababc159a0f8d4f5bf","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35987144/","publishdate":"2022-08-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35987144/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nPretreatment with acadesine shows therapeutic potential SAP-ALI in vivo and vitro.

Moreover, experiments are carried out in organoids, and a tumor implantation model is established in obese mice, demonstrating that the inhibition of MTTP increases the sensitivity to chemotherapy.

Abstract\nLiver fibrosis is characterized by the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components and results from chronic liver injury. At present, there is no approved drug for the treatment of liver fibrosis by the Food and Drug Administration. Here, we have reported a series of novel compounds with phenacrylanilide scaffolds that potently inhibit the transfer growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)-induced activation of LX-2, a hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line. Among them, compound 42 suppressed TGF-β1-induced upregulation of fibrotic markers (α-SMA and fibronectin) and showed excellent safety in vitro. Furthermore, in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) -induced liver fibrosis model, 42 at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day through oral administration for 3 weeks effectively improved liver function, restored damaged liver structures, and reduced collagen deposition, with a greater effect than Tranilast. In addition, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is inhibited by compound 42 in the process of fibrosis. Meanwhile, the imbalanced immune microenvironment could also be effectively reversed. More interestingly, compound 42 prolongs the survival of CCl4 mice and ameliorates CCl4-induced injury to spleen, kidney, lung and heart.

Different isoforms of COOLAIR influence FLC transcriptional output in warm and cold conditions2-7. Here, to further investigate the function of COOLAIR, we developed an RNA structure-profiling method to determine the in vivo structure of single RNA molecules rather than the RNA population average. This revealed that individual isoforms of the COOLAIR transcript adopt multiple structures with different conformational dynamics. The major distally polyadenylated COOLAIR isoform in warm conditions adopts three predominant structural conformations, the proportions and conformations of which change after cold exposure. An alternatively spliced, strongly cold-upregulated distal COOLAIR isoform6 shows high structural diversity, in contrast to proximally polyadenylated COOLAIR. A hyper-variable COOLAIR structural element was identified that was complementary to the FLC transcription start site. Mutations altering the structure of this region changed FLC expression and flowering time, consistent with an important regulatory role of the COOLAIR structure in FLC transcription.

However, current treatments to slow CKD progression are limited. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a product of sphingolipid catabolism, is a pleiotropic mediator involved in many cellular functions, and drugs targeting S1P signaling have previously been studied particularly for autoimmune diseases. The primary mechanism of most of these drugs is functional antagonism of S1P receptor-1 (S1P1) expressed on lymphocytes and the resultant immunosuppressive effect. Here, we documented the role of local S1P signaling in perivascular cells in the progression of kidney fibrosis using primary kidney perivascular cells and several conditional mouse models. S1P was predominantly produced by sphingosine kinase 2 in kidney perivascular cells and exported via spinster homolog 2 (Spns2). It bound to S1P1 expressed in perivascular cells to enhance production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines upon injury, leading to immune cell infiltration and subsequent fibrosis. A small-molecule Spns2 inhibitor blocked S1P transport, resulting in suppression of inflammatory signaling in human and mouse kidney perivascular cells in vitro and amelioration of kidney fibrosis in mice. Our study provides insight into the regulation of inflammation and fibrosis by S1P and demonstrates the potential of Spns2 inhibition as a treatment for CKD and potentially other inflammatory and fibrotic diseases that avoids the adverse events associated with systemic modulation of S1P receptors.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660694400,"objectID":"238b9950138e8d62e448849e3ad0bab8","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35976996/","publishdate":"2022-08-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35976996/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nChronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by sustained inflammation and progressive fibrosis, is highly prevalent and can eventually progress to end-stage kidney disease.

Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) family of transcription factors, regulates transcription by forming heterodimers with another NHR family member, Retinoid X Receptor (RXR). Each component of the heterodimer binds specific ligands that modify transcriptional capacity of the entire heterodimer by recruiting different co-activators/co-repressors. However, the role of PPARγ/RXR ligands in the context of influenza infection is not well understood. PPARγ is associated with macrophage differentiation to an anti-inflammatory M2 state. We show that mice lacking the IL-4Rα receptor, required for M2a macrophage differentiation, are more susceptible to mouse-adapted influenza (A/PR/8/34; “PR8”)-induced lethality. Mice lacking Ptgs2, that encodes COX-2, a key proinflammatory M1 macrophage mediator, are more resistant. Blocking the receptor for COX-2-induced Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was also protective. Treatment with pioglitazone (PGZ), a PPARγ ligand, increased survival from PR8 infection, decreased M1 macrophage gene expression, and increased PPARγ mRNA in lungs. Conversely, conditional knockout mice expressing PPARγ-deficient macrophages were significantly more sensitive to PR8-induced lethality. These findings were extended in cotton rats: PGZ blunted lung inflammation and M1 cytokine gene expression after challenge with non-adapted human influenza. To study mechanisms by which PPARγ/RXR transcription factors induce canonical M2a genes, WT mouse macrophages were treated with IL-4 in the absence or presence of rosiglitazone (RGZ; PPARγ ligand), LG100754 (LG; RXR ligand), or both. IL-4 dose-dependently induced M2a genes Arg1, Mrc1, Chil3, and Retnla. Treatment of macrophages with IL-4 and RGZ and/or LG differentially affected induction of Arg1 and Mrc1 vs. Chil3 and Retnla gene expression. In PPARγ-deficient macrophages, IL-4 alone failed to induce Arg1 and Mrc1 gene expression; however, concurrent treatment with LG or RGZ + LG enhanced IL-4-induced Arg1 and Mrc1 expression, but to a lower level than in WT macrophages, findings confirmed in the murine alveolar macrophage cell line, MH-S. These findings support a model in which PPARγ/RXR heterodimers control IL-4-induced M2a differentiation, and suggest that PPARγ/RXR agonists should be considered as important tools for clinical intervention against influenza-induced ALI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660608000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660608000,"objectID":"5c3707582dc138f7025bf407216d818e","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36052067/","publishdate":"2022-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36052067/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nMany respiratory viruses cause lung damage that may evolve into acute lung injury (ALI), a cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and ultimately, death.

This study aimed to explore the therapeutic efficacy of QBH in the treatment of ARIs-induced pneumonia. Network pharmacology was used to predict the possible targets of QBH against ARIs. Next, the tracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS-)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) immature rat model was constructed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of QBH. Tandem mass tag (TMT-)-based quantitative proteomics was then used to screen the in-depth disease targets of QBH. QBH exerted a protective effect against LPS-induced ALI by inhibiting pulmonary pathological damage. QBH also reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the serum and IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF in the lung tissue.

Our findings demonstrated that QBH alleviated lung tissue damage and inflammatory reaction via inhibiting OLFM4 expression in LPS-challenged immature rats.

Importantly, regardless of the serine feeder strategy, serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2)-driven compartmentalization of one-carbon metabolism inside the mitochondria represents a specific adaptation of resistant cells to support purine biosynthesis and potentiate DNA damage response.

Here we show that interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is essential for efficient activation of STING-mediated innate immune responses in monocytes. This function of IRF8 is independent of its transcriptional role in monocyte differentiation. In uninfected cells, IRF8 remains inactive via sequestration of its IRF-associated domain by its N- and C-terminal tails, which reduces its association with STING. Upon triggering the DNA sensing pathway, IRF8 is phosphorylated at Serine 151 to allow its association with STING via the IRF-associated domain. This is essential for STING polymerization and TBK1-mediated STING and IRF3 phosphorylation. Consistently, IRF8-deficiency impairs host defense against the DNA virus HSV-1, and blocks DNA damage-induced cellular senescence. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells which have an autoimmune phenotype due to deficiency of Trex1, respond to IRF-8 deletion with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients are characterized by elevated phosphorylation of IRF8 at the same Serine residue we find to be important in STING activation, and in these cells STING is hyper-active.

This study aims to clarify the effect of metabolic nuclear receptors on Lgr5+ cell fate in liver.\nMethods: We performed cell experiments with primary hepatocytes, Hep 1-6, Hep G2, and Huh 7 cells, and animal studies with wild-type (WT), farnesoid X receptor (FXR) knockout mice, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) knockout mice and Lgr5-CreERT2; Rosa26-mTmG mice. GW4064 and CDCA were used to activate FXR. And GW7647 or Wy14643 was used for PPARα activation. Regulation of Lgr5 by FXR and PPARα was determined by QRT-PCR, western blot (WB) and RNAscope® in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunofluorescence (IF), luciferase reporter assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).

DDC diet triggered the transition of Lgr5+ cells from resting state to proliferation. FXR activation enhanced Lgr5+ cell expansion mainly by symmetric cell division, but PPARα activation prevented Lgr5+ cell proliferation along with asymmetric cell division.\nConclusion: Our findings unravel the opposite regulatory effects of FXR and PPARα on Lgr5+ cell fate in liver under physiological and pathological conditions, which will greatly assist novel therapeutic development targeting nuclear receptors.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660521600,"objectID":"4dea7cb8268676aaf31c88718b672340","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36168631/","publishdate":"2022-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36168631/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) is a target gene of Wnt/β-Catenin which plays a vital role in hepatic development and regeneration.

Analysis of transendothelial electrical resistance and EC monolayer permeability for macromolecues revealed that H3 and H4, but not H1, H2A, or H2B caused dose-dependent EC permeability accompanied by disassembly of adherens junctions. At higher doses, H3 and H4 activated nuclear factor kappa B inflammatory cascade leading to upregulation EC adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1, E-selectin, and release of inflammatory cytokines. Inhibitory receptor analysis showed that toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 but not TLR1/2 or receptor for advanced glycation end inhibition significantly attenuated deleterious effects of H3 and H4 histones. Inhibitor of Rho-kinase was without effect, while inhibition of Src kinase caused partial preservation of cell-cell junctions, H3/H4-induced permeability and inflammation. Deleterious effects of H3/H4 were blocked by heparin. Activation of Epac-Rap1 signaling restored EC barrier properties after histone challenge. Intravenous injection of histones in mice caused elevation of inflammatory markers and increased vascular leak.

We found that the methylation levels of H3K36 negatively correlated with VSMC proliferation and neointima formation. Next, we revealed that JIB-04 (a pan-inhibitor of the Jumonji demethylase superfamily) could increase the methylation levels of H3K36. Furthermore, we found that JIB-04 obviously inhibited HASMC proliferation, and a cell cycle assay showed that JIB-04 caused G2/M phase arrest in HASMCs by inhibiting the phosphorylation of RB and CDC2 and promoting the phosphorylation of CHK1. Moreover, JIB-04 inhibited the expression of MMP2 to suppress the migration of HASMCs and repressed the expression of contraction-related genes. RNA sequencing analysis showed that the biological processes associated with the cell cycle and autophagy were enriched by using Gene Ontology analysis after HASMCs were treated with JIB-04. Furthermore, we demonstrated that JIB-04 impairs autophagic flux by downregulating STX17 and RAB7 expression to inhibit the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes.\nConclusion: JIB-04 suppresses the proliferation, migration, and contractile phenotype of HASMCs by inhibiting autophagic flux, which indicates that JIB-04 is a promising reagent for the treatment of neointima formation.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660348800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660348800,"objectID":"beb0a50a8fa4c46ce2140413e957da39","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35964071/","publishdate":"2022-08-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35964071/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype switching is critical for neointima formation, which is the major cause of restenosis after stenting or coronary artery bypass grafting.

Abstract\nAcute lung injury (ALI) is a disease characterized by pulmonary diffusion dysfunction and its exacerbation stage is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may develop to multiple organ failure and seriously threatens human health. ALI has high mortality rates and few effective treatments, thus effective protection measures for ALI are becoming increasingly important. Macrophages play a key regulatory role in the pathogenesis of ALI, and the degree of macrophage polarization is closely related to the severity and prognosis of ALI. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Zanubrutinib (ZB), a BTK small molecule inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of cell lymphoma, on macrophage polarization and acute lung injury. In the in vivo study, we constructed a mouse model of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury and found that ZB could improve the acute injury of mouse lungs by inhibiting the secretion of proinflammatory factors and promoting the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, reduce the number of inflammatory cells in alveolar lavage fluid, and then alleviate the inflammatory response. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that ZB could inhibit the M1 macrophage polarization and promote the M2 macrophage polarization. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that ZB could inhibit the macrophage M1 polarization via targeting BTK activation and inhibiting JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways, and promote the macrophage M2 polarization by promoting the activation of STAT6 and PI3K / Akt signaling pathways. In summary, ZB has shown therapeutic effect in LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, which provides a potential candidate drug to treat acute lung injury.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660348800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660348800,"objectID":"4171429844e57423aa4ca95179ea8d2f","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35973369/","publishdate":"2022-08-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35973369/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nZanubrutinib could relieve LPS induced lung injuries in mice.

CircSV2b participates in the progress of PD through the ceRNA-Akt1 axis. CircSV2b overexpression is neuroprotective by resisting oxidative stress injury. Foxk1 can regulate Akt1 transcription. Abstract\nAs a novel type of non-coding RNAs, covalently closed circular RNAs (circRNAs) are ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes. Emerging studies have indicated that dysregulation of circRNAs was related to neurological diseases. However, the biogenesis, regulation, function, and mechanism of circRNAs in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remain largely unclear. In this study, thirty-three differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) were detected by RNA-sequencing between the MPTP-induced PD mice model and the wild-type mice. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the RNA level of DECs in the striatum (STR), substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and serum exosomes, and it was found that circSV2b was downregulated in PD mice. Then, functional experiments in vivo were employed to explore the effect of circSV2b in PD. For the mechanism study, dual-luciferase reporter, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull-down, gene editing, and CUT \u0026amp; Tag were performed in vitro to confirm that circSV2b directly sponged miR-5107-5p and alleviated the suppression of the expression of the target gene Foxk1, and then positively regulated Akt1 transcription. In vivo, the mechanistic analysis demonstrated that circSV2b overexpression resisted oxidative stress damage through the ceRNA-Akt1 axis in PD models. Taken together, these findings suggested that the miR-5107-5p-Foxk1-Akt1 axis might serve as a key target of circSV2b overexpression in PD treatment, and highlighted the significant change of circSV2b in serum exosomes.

However, key for translation to the clinic is understanding the mechanism of malonate entry into cells to enable inhibition of SDH, its mitochondrial target, as malonate itself poorly permeates cellular membranes. The possibility of malonate selectively entering the at-risk heart tissue on reperfusion, however, remains unexplored.\nMethods: C57BL/6J mice, C2C12 and H9c2 myoblasts, and HeLa cells were used to elucidate the mechanism of selective malonate uptake into the ischemic heart upon reperfusion. Cells were treated with malonate while varying pH or together with transport inhibitors. Mouse hearts were either perfused ex vivo (Langendorff) or subjected to in vivo left anterior descending coronary artery ligation as models of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Succinate and malonate levels were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS, in vivo by mass spectrometry imaging, and infarct size by TTC (2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride) staining.\nResults: Malonate was robustly protective against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury, but only if administered at reperfusion and not when infused before ischemia. The extent of malonate uptake into the heart was proportional to the duration of ischemia. Malonate entry into cardiomyocytes in vivo and in vitro was dramatically increased at the low pH (≈6.5) associated with ischemia. This increased uptake of malonate was blocked by selective inhibition of MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter 1). Reperfusion of the ischemic heart region with malonate led to selective SDH inhibition in the at-risk region. Acid-formulation greatly enhances the cardioprotective potency of malonate.\nConclusions: Cardioprotection by malonate is dependent on its entry into cardiomyocytes. This is facilitated by the local decrease in pH that occurs during ischemia, leading to its selective uptake upon reperfusion into the at-risk tissue, via MCT1. Thus, malonate’s preferential uptake in reperfused tissue means it is an at-risk tissue-selective drug that protects against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660262400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660262400,"objectID":"2fd513b021e138665d5e08dc1f8a272b","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35959683/","publishdate":"2022-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35959683/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Inhibiting SDH (succinate dehydrogenase), with the competitive inhibitor malonate, has shown promise in ameliorating ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Histone-induced cytotoxicity was measured using SYTOX green staining in the synoviocyte cell line MH7A and macrophages differentiated from the monocytic cell line THP-1, and the production of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) was measured by HMGB1 and ATP. Furthermore, we performed RNA-seq analysis of THP-1 cells stimulated with H2B-α1 peptide or with its citrullinated form. The levels of histones were elevated in RA synovial fluid, and histones aggravated arthritis in the STA model. Histones induced cytotoxicity and DAMP production in synoviocytes and macrophages. Chondroitin sulfate reduced histone-induced cytotoxicity, while lipopolysaccharides aggravated cytotoxicity. Moreover, the cytotoxicity decreased when the arginines in H2B-α1 were replaced with citrullines, which demonstrated its electrostatic nature.

Analyses of PPI networks, functional enrichment, as well as use of the MCODE algorithm were used to identify key ferroptosis-related DEGs. Expression of key ferroptosis-related DEGs was verified using: GSE57065 and GSE65682 datasets; rats in which ferroptosis was induced with erastin; sepsis-induced acute lung injury (siALI) rats. The effects of acupoint catgut embedding (ACE) on ferroptosis and expression of key ferroptosis-related DEGs in the lungs of siALI rats were also observed. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to verify the effect of key ferroptosis-related DEGs on the survival of sepsis patients. Cytoscape was used to construct ceRNA networks and gene-transcription factor networks.\nResults: Between sepsis patients and HVs, we identified 33 ferroptosis-related DEGs. According to analyses of PPI networks and the MCODE algorithm, we obtained four modules, of which the most significant module contained nine ferroptosis-related DEGs. Functional-enrichment analyses showed that four of the nine DEGs were enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway: MAPK14, VEGFA, TGFBR1, and DUSP1. We verified expression of these four genes in GSE57065 and GSE65682 datasets and ferroptosis rats. In addition, expression of these four genes and that of the oxidative-stress indicators GSSG and MDA was upregulated, and glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4) expression was downregulated, in siALI rats, but ACE reversed these changes. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that survival of sepsis patients in the high-risk group was shorter than that in the low-risk group. We found that the XIST-hsa-let-7b-5p-TGFBR1/DUSP1 ceRNA network and transcription factor E2F1 may be important regulators of these four DEGs.\nConclusion: Our results suggest that MAPK14, VEGFA, TGFBR1, and DUSP1 may be key regulatory targets of ferroptosis in sepsis, and that ACE pretreatment may be antioxidant treatment for sepsis and alleviate ferroptosis.

The predictive model based on metagenomic, metabolomic and KO gene markers achieved a powerful classification performance for distinguishing EO-CRC from controls.\nConclusion: Our large-sample multiomics data suggest that altered microbiome-metabolome interplay helps explain the pathogenesis of EO-CRC and LO-CRC.

Mitochondria are dynamic and possess a quality control system that targets mitochondrial quantity and quality by modifying mitochondrial fusion, fission, mitophagy, and biogenesis and protein homeostasis to maintain a healthy mitochondrial network. The system of mitochondrial quality control involves complex molecular machinery that is highly interconnected and associated with pathological changes such as oxidative stress, calcium overload, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Because of the critical role of the mitochondrial quality control systems, many reports have suggested that defects in this system are among the molecular mechanisms underlying myocardial reperfusion injury.

In an independent cohort of 26 individuals who died of COVID-19, we used histopathological signs of brain damage as a guide for possible SARS-CoV-2 brain infection and found that among the 5 individuals who exhibited those signs, all of them had genetic material of the virus in the brain. Brain tissue samples from these five patients also exhibited foci of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, particularly in astrocytes. Supporting the hypothesis of astrocyte infection, neural stem cell-derived human astrocytes in vitro are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection through a noncanonical mechanism that involves spike-NRP1 interaction. SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes manifested changes in energy metabolism and in key proteins and metabolites used to fuel neurons, as well as in the biogenesis of neurotransmitters. Moreover, human astrocyte infection elicits a secretory phenotype that reduces neuronal viability. Our data support the model in which SARS-CoV-2 reaches the brain, infects astrocytes, and consequently, leads to neuronal death or dysfunction.

Therefore, the use of a novel pharmacologically active carrier for pulmonary delivery may produce synergetic effects in treating ALI. Considering the pathophysiological environment of ALI, which typically featured excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acute inflammation, we synthesized a novel kind of biodegradable and ROS-sensitive cross-linked covalent cyclodextrin frameworks (OC-COF) with uniform inhalable particle size to treat ALI.

In ALI rats, inhalation of LIG@OC-COF with a one-fifth LIG dose significantly alleviated the inflammation, oxidant stress, and lung damage.

Macrophages are important mediators of ARDS inflammatory response. Suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins are key regulators of the macrophage phenotype switch. We therefore investigated whether SOCS proteins are involved in mediation of the MSC effect on human macrophage reprogramming.\nMethods: Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or plasma samples from patients with ARDS (these samples were previously classified into hypo-inflammatory and hyper-inflammatory phenotype) and treated with MSC conditioned medium (CM) or EVs. Protein expression was measured by Western blot. EV micro RNA (miRNA) content was determined by miRNA sequencing. In vivo: LPS-injured C57BL/6 mice were given EVs isolated from MSCs in which miR-181a had been silenced by miRNA inhibitor or overexpressed using miRNA mimic.\nResults: EVs were the key component of MSC CM responsible for anti-inflammatory modulation of human macrophages. EVs significantly reduced secretion of tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-8 by LPS-stimulated or ARDS plasma-stimulated MDMs and this was dependent on SOCS1. Transfer of miR-181a in EVs downregulated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and subsequently activated phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5) leading to upregulation of SOCS1 in macrophages. In vivo, EVs alleviated lung injury and upregulated pSTAT5 and SOCS1 expression in alveolar macrophages in a miR181-dependent manner. Overexpression of miR-181a in MSCs significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy of EVs in this model.\nConclusion: miR-181a-PTEN-pSTAT5-SOCS1 axis is a novel pathway responsible for immunomodulatory effect of MSC EVs in ARDS.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660089600,"objectID":"b120f5606cc1d6adcf63f4cac917cf21","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35948417/","publishdate":"2022-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35948417/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nRationale: A better understanding of the mechanism of action of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) is needed to support their use as novel therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).","tags":["RNA","non-coding RNAs","Extracellular Vesicles","Tissue Injury","Immunology","Inflammation","Lung","microRNAs"],"title":"Mesenchymal stromal cells-derived extracellular vesicles reprogramme macrophages in ARDS models through the miR-181a-5p-PTEN-pSTAT5-SOCS1 axis","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Highlights\nOridonin alleviates the progression of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis mice.

Abstract\nSilicosis, the most common type of pneumoconiosis, exhibits a high incidence in workers who are chronically exposed to crystalline silica (CS). No specific remedy for cure as yet. The terpenoid oridonin exerts multiple modulatory functions in neoplasms and inflammations as a natural compound. In this study, we explored the effect of oridonin on silicosis and revealed the underlying molecular mechanism. An experimental silicosis mouse model was established to evaluate the effects of oridonin on pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, the impact of oridonin on alveolar macrophages (AMs) was examined in the MH-S cell line. Its molecular target, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), was identified by chemobiological means, and virus-mediated gene overexpression systems confirmed that oridonin directly restrained iNOS protein levels. Oridonin alleviated pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis in silicosis mice with no obvious systemic toxicity. These effects were partially related to oridonin inhibition of CS-induced AMs injury and inflammation. Furthermore, oridonin suppressed iNOS enzymatic expression and activity by covalently binding to the Thr109 residue of the iNOS target. Thus, our results indicate oridonin as a potential iNOS enzymatic suppressor in experimental silicosis that attenuates pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis progression, which provides a therapeutic avenue for silicosis prevention and treatment.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660089600,"objectID":"6d8168d1b56b2ca8d02f34952b174bbf","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36076611/","publishdate":"2022-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36076611/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nOridonin alleviates the progression of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis mice.

The ligand-activated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ plays essential roles in diverse biological processes including inflammation, metabolism, development, and immune response. Salvianolactone acid A (SA) is a terpenoid derived from the herb Salvia miltiorrhiza. However, there is a scarcity of experimental evidence indicating whether the effect of SA on ALI occurs via PPAR-γ.\nMethods: SA (20 or 40 mg/kg, i.g., 1 time/day) was administered to mice for 3 d, followed by the induction of ALI by intranasal lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg). The lung function and levels of inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), immune cells, apoptosis, and PPAR-γ were examined. The antagonistic activity of GW9662 (GW, 1 µM, specific PPAR-γ blocker) and PPAR-γ transfection silencing against SA (10 μM) in BEAS-2B cells induced by LPS (10 μg/ml, 24 h) was also investigated to assess whether the observed effects caused by SA were mediated by PPAR-γ.\nResults: The results showed that lung histopathological injury, the B-line, the fluorescence intensity of live small animal, and the biomarkers in BALF or lung in the treatment of SA could regulate significantly. In addition, SA obviously decreased the levels of ROS and apoptosis in the primary lung cells, and MDA, increased the levels of GSH-Px and SOD. SA reduced levels of macrophages and neutrophils. Furthermore, SA reduced the protein levels of Keap-1, Cleaved-caspase-3, Cleaved-caspase-9, p-p65/p65, NLRP3, IL-1β, and upregulated the levels of p-Nrf2/Nrf2, HO-1, Bcl-2/Bax, PPAR-γ, p-AMPK/AMPK in lung tissue. In addition, silencing and inhibition of PPAR-γ effectively decreased the protective effects of SA in BEAS-2B cells induced by LPS, which might indicate that the active molecules of SA regulate ALI via mediation by PPAR-γ, which exhibited that the effect of SA related to PPAR-γ.\nConclusions: The anti-ALI effects of SA were partially mediated through PPAR-γ signaling.

Circular RNA (circRNA) has been identified as important epigenetic factor in numerous diseases. However, the biological roles of inflammation-related circRNAs in regulating OA pathogenesis remain elusive. Here, we revealed circRNA expression profiles in human primary chondrocytes with interleukin-1β (IL-1β) stimulation by circRNA sequencing. We identified a highly upregulated circRNA, termed as circNFKB1 in inflamed chondrocytes and osteoarthritic cartilage. As a circRNA derived from exon 2-5 of NFKB1, circNFKB1 is located in both cytoplasm and nucleus of chondrocytes. Furthermore, knockdown of circNFKB1 inhibited extracellular matrix (ECM) catabolism and rescued IL-1β impaired ECM anabolism whereas ectopic expression of circNFKB1 significantly promoted chondrocytes degradation in vitro. Moreover, intraarticular injection of adenovirus-circNFKB1 in mouse joints triggered spontaneous cartilage loss and OA development. Mechanistically, circNFKB1 interacted with α-enolase (ENO1), regulated the expression of its parental gene NFKB1 and sustained the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in chondrocytes. Therefore, this study highlights a novel ENO1-interacting circNFKB1 in OA pathogenesis, and provides valuable insights into understanding the regulatory mechanism of NF-κB signaling in chondrocytes and a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of OA.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660003200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660003200,"objectID":"c625a99a5ed71fdebbcfb7b461299549","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35945200/","publishdate":"2022-08-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35945200/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nInflammatory cytokines-induced activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA).

However, recent findings show that functions of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages are not completely suppressed, whereas they undergo a functional re-programming process with upregulation of a panel of molecules leading to enhanced protective functions including antimicrobial and tissue-remodeling activities. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), exerts anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective activities. Nevertheless, the potential effects of EPO on functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages have not been investigated yet. Here, we found that initial LPS exposure led to upregulation of HIF-1α/EPO in macrophages and that EPO enhanced tolerance in tolerized macrophages and mice as demonstrated by suppressed proinflammatory genes such as Il1b, Il6, and Tnfa after secondary LPS stimulation. Moreover, we showed that EPO improved host protective genes in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages and mice, such as the anti-bacterial genes coding for cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (Cnlp) and macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (Marco), and the tissue-repairing gene vascular endothelial growth factor C (Vegfc). Therefore, our findings indicate that EPO mediates the functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages. Mechanistically, we found that PI3K/AKT signaling contributed to EPO-mediated re-programming through upregulation of Irak3 and Wdr5 expression. Specifically, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK3) was responsible for inhibiting proinflammatory genes Il1b, Il6, and Tnfa in tolerized macrophages after LPS rechallenge, whereas WDR5 contributed to the upregulation of host beneficial genes including Cnlp, Marco, and Vegfc. In a septic model of mice, EPO pretreatment significantly promoted endotoxin-tolerant re-programming, alleviated lung injury, enhanced bacterial clearance, and decreased mortality in LPS-tolerized mice after secondary infection of Escherichia coli. Collectively, our results reveal a novel role for EPO in mediating functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages; thus, targeting EPO appears to be a new therapeutic option in sepsis and other inflammatory disorders.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1660003200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660003200,"objectID":"8c7f108e861c1fa6501dee63dfb36b06","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36016936/","publishdate":"2022-08-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36016936/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nInitial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure leads to a hypo-responsive state by macrophages to a secondary stimulation of LPS, known as endotoxin tolerance.

Cangma Huadu (CMHD) granules, an in-hospital preparation of traditional Chinese medicine, have been shown to be favorable in the clinical treatment of influenza. However, the effects and mechanisms of CMHD granules on severe influenza pneumonia and its mechanisms are not well-known. In this study, a lethal influenza A (H1N1) A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (PR8)-infected mice model was established, and the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) V3-V4 region sequencing of the intestinal microbiome was conducted. We revealed that the oral administration of CMHD granules protects mice against higher mortality, enhanced weight loss, overwhelmed interferon-γ concentration, lung viral titers, and severe lung pathological injury in PR8-infected mice. CMHD granules’ administration downregulated the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and malondialdehyde, while it upregulated the levels of IL-10, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. Subsequently, it decreased the protein ratio of B-cell lymphoma-2/Bcl-2-associated X and the expression of cleaved caspase-3. The diversity and compositions of the gut microbes were altered profoundly after the administration of CMHD granules in PR8-infected mice. A higher abundance of Bifidobacterium, Parasutterella, Bacteroides, and Faecalibaculum was observed in the CMHD group, and a higher abundance of Lactobacillus and Turicibacter was observed in the positive drug Ribavirin group. The linear discriminant analysis effect size also revealed a higher proportion of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium_pseudolongum characterized in the CMHD group. These results demonstrated that CMHD granules are a promising strategy for managing severe influenza and attenuating severe lung damage via reducing viral titer, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress.

Abstract\nThe long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in multiple human cancers, which may offer great potential as putative targets for cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, the roles of most lncRNAs in gallbladder cancer (GBC) remain poorly understood. The objective of this research involves investigating the clinical implications and underlying mechanism of lncRNA motor neuron and pancreas homeobo×1 antisense RNA 1 (MNX1-AS1) in GBC.

Functionally, MNX1-AS1 significantly stimulates the proliferation and metastasis of GBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MNX1-AS1 is transcriptionally activated by TEA domain family member 4 (TEAD4), and suppresses insulin-like growing factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) degradation by recruiting ubiquitin specific peptidase 16 (USP16). Furthermore, MNX1-AS1/IGF2BP3 axis inhibits the Hippo signaling pathway and subsequently activates TEAD4, thereby forming a positive feedback loop.

However, the specific mechanisms underlying cell death during cerebral I/R injury have yet to be completely clarified. There is thus a need to identify the PCD-related gene signatures and the associated regulatory axes in cerebral I/R injury, which should provide novel therapeutic targets against cerebral I/R injury.\nMethods: We analyzed transcriptome signatures of brain tissue samples from mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and matched controls, and identified differentially expressed genes related to the three types of PCD(apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis). We next performed functional enrichment analysis and constructed PCD-related competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks. We also conducted hub gene analysis to identify hub nodes and key regulatory axes.\nResults: Fifteen PCD-related genes were identified. Functional enrichment analysis showed that they were particularly associated with corresponding PCD-related biological processes, inflammatory response, and reactive oxygen species metabolic processes. The apoptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network was constructed, which included 24 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), 41 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 4 messenger RNAs (mRNAs); the necroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network included 16 lncRNAs, 20 miRNAs, and 6 mRNAs; and the pyroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network included 15 lncRNAs, 18 miRNAs, and 6 mRNAs. Hub gene analysis identified hub nodes in each PCD-related ceRNA regulatory network and seven key regulatory axes in total, namely, lncRNA Malat1/miR-181a-5p/Mapt, lncRNA Malat1/miR-181b-5p/Mapt, lncRNA Neat1/miR-181a-5p/Mapt, and lncRNA Neat1/miR-181b-5p/Mapt for the apoptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network; lncRNA Neat1/miR-181a-5p/Tnf for the necroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network; lncRNA Malat1/miR-181c-5p/Tnf for the pyroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network; and lncRNAMalat1/miR-181a-5p for both necroptosis-related and pyroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory networks.\nConclusion: The results of this study supported the hypothesis that these PCD pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and PANoptosis) and crosstalk among them might be involved in ischemic stroke and that the key nodes and regulatory axes identified in this study might play vital roles in regulating the above processes.

L-selenomethionine is organic selenium (Se), which can inhibit intracellular ROS generation, block ROS-dependent autophagy, promote mitochondrial energy metabolism, and enhance the body’s immunity. Lung, as an important organ of the respiratory system, is highly susceptible to the toxic effects of NH3. However, there were few studies on the mechanism of toxic effects of NH3 on lung tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NH3 on the lungs in pigs and the alleviating effect of L-selenomethionine. Twenty-four Large White-Duroc-Min pigs were randomly assigned to 4 groups: control group, NH3 group, Se group, and NH3 +Se group. The results showed that exposure to NH3 caused damage and inflammation in lung tissues and significantly increased blood NH3 concentration. NH3 induced changes of oxidative stress indexes (GSH, GSH-Px, SOD, MDA, Keap1, Nrf2, and HO-1) and expressions of energy metabolism related genes (HK1, HK2, PFK, PK, LDHA, and HIF-1α). Ultrastructure showed that mitochondrial damage and autophagosome increased significantly, and the expression levels of autophagy related genes (Beclin1, ATG5, ATG7, ATG10, and p62) changed.

However, the effect and action mechanism of I. japonica on ALI is still unclear.\nPurpose: This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanism of total flavonoids of I. japonica (TFIJ) in the treatment of ALI.\nStudy design and methods: A mouse ALI model was established through administration of LPS by the intratracheal instillation. Protective effects of TFIJ in the inflammation and oxidative stress were studied in LPS-induced ALI mice based on inflammatory and oxidative stress factors, including MDA, MPO, SOD, and TNF-α. Lipid metabolomics, bioinformatics, Western blot, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry were performed to reveal the potential mechanism of TFIJ in the treatment of ALI.\nResults: TFIJ significantly alleviated the interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells and the collapse of the alveoli in LPS-induced ALI mice. Lipid metabolomics demonstrated that TFIJ could significantly affect the CYP2J/sEH-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism, such as 11,12-EET, 14,15-EET, 8,9-DHET, 11,12-DHET, and 14,15-DHET, revealing that sEH was the potential target of TFIJ, which was further supported by the recombinant sEH-mediated the substrate hydrolysis in vitro (IC50 = 1.18 μg/ml). Inhibition of sEH by TFIJ alleviated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress via the MAPK, NF-κB, and Nrf2 signaling pathways.\nConclusion: These results demonstrated that TFIJ could suppress the sEH activity to stabilize the level of EETs, allowing the alleviation of the pathological course of lung injury in LPS-treated mice, which suggested that TFIJ could serve as the potential agents in the treatment of ALI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1659484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659484800,"objectID":"02420b11541dbe69a8c9bb590301609c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36150346/","publishdate":"2022-08-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36150346/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe respiratory disease characterized by diffuse lung interstitial and respiratory distress and pulmonary edema with a mortality rate of 35%-40%.

Of the two UFM1-specific proteases (UFSPs) identified in humans, only UFSP2 is reported to be active, since the annotated sequence of UFSP1 lacks critical catalytic residues. Nonetheless, efficient UFM1 maturation occurs in cells lacking UFSP2, suggesting the presence of another active protease. We herein identify UFSP1 translated from a non-canonical start site to be this protease. Cells lacking both UFSPs show complete loss of UFMylation resulting from an absence of mature UFM1. While UFSP2, but not UFSP1, removes UFM1 from the ribosomal subunit RPL26, UFSP1 acts earlier in the pathway to mature UFM1 and cleave a potential autoinhibitory modification on UFC1, thereby controlling activation of UFMylation. In summary, our studies reveal important distinctions in substrate specificity and localization-dependent functions for the two proteases in regulating UFMylation.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1659398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659398400,"objectID":"328077cc93c388e625e18dff88d4789b","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35926457/","publishdate":"2022-08-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35926457/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nActive human UFSP1 is translated from a non-canonical start site UFSP1 mediates UFM1 maturation and cleaves UFM1 off UFMylated UFC1 Subcellular localization dictates unique substrate preferences of UFSP1 and UFSP2 Summary","tags":["UFMylation"],"title":"Human UFSP1 is an active protease that regulates UFM1 maturation and UFMylation","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nPhosgene (COCl2) gas is a chemical intermediate of high-volume production with numerous industrial applications worldwide.

Research over the past years has provided a substantial body of evidence demonstrating that platelets also participate in host innate immunity. The surface expression of pattern recognition receptors, such as TLR2 and TLR4, provides platelets with the ability to sense bacterial products in their environment. Platelet α-granules contain microbicidal proteins, chemokines and growth factors, which upon release may directly engage pathogens and/or contribute to inflammatory signaling. Additionally, platelet interactions with neutrophils enhance neutrophil activation and are often crucial to induce a sufficient immune response. In particular, platelets can activate neutrophils to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This specific neutrophil effector function is characterized by neutrophils expelling chromatin fibres decorated with histones and antimicrobial proteins into the extracellular space where they serve to trap and kill pathogens. Until now, the mechanisms and signaling pathways between platelets and neutrophils inducing NET formation are still not fully characterized. NETs were also detected in thrombotic lesions in several disease backgrounds, pointing towards a role as an interface between neutrophils, platelets and thrombosis, also known as immunothrombosis. The negatively charged DNA within NETs provides a procoagulant surface, and in particular NET-derived proteins may directly activate platelets. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the topic of immunothrombosis has become more relevant than ever, as a majority of COVID-19 patients display thrombi in the lung capillaries and other vascular beds. Furthermore, NETs can be found in the lung and other tissues and are associated with an increased mortality. Here, virus infiltration may lead to a cytokine storm that potently activates neutrophils and leads to massive neutrophil infiltration into the lung and NET formation. The resulting NETs presumably activate platelets and coagulation factors, further contributing to the subsequent emergence of microthrombi in pulmonary capillaries. In this review, we will discuss the interplay between platelets and NETs and the potential of this alliance to influence the course of inflammatory diseases. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and the identification of treatment targets is of utmost importance to increase patients’ survival and improve the clinical outcome.\n\u0026lt; Back to Reviews Alternative to Homepage ","date":1659312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659312000,"objectID":"ae7c30a5c1afc5051c9a28f4edc953b7","permalink":"https://example.com/review/35979369/","publishdate":"2022-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/review/35979369/","section":"review","summary":"Abstract\nPlatelets are well characterized for their indispensable role in primary hemostasis to control hemorrhage.

Herein, this study aimed to explore the involvement of ferroptosis in the etiopathogenesis of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and demonstrate that YAP1 could disrupt ferritinophagy and moderate sepsis-induced ALI. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models were constructed in wild-type (WT) and pulmonary epithelium-conditional knockout (YAP1f/f) mice to induce ALI, while MLE-12 cells with or without YAP1 overexpression were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. In-vivo modes showed that YAP1 knockout aggravated CLP-induced ALI and also accelerated pulmonary ferroptosis, as presented by the downregulated expression of GPX4, FTH1, and SLC7A11, along with the upregulated expression of SFXN1 and NCOA4. Transcriptome research identified these key genes and ferroptosis pathways involved in sepsis-induced ALI. In-vitro modes consistently verified that YAP1 deficiency boosted the ferrous iron accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction in response to LPS. Furthermore, the co-IP assay revealed that YAP1 overexpression could prevent the degradation of ferritin to a mass of Fe2+ (ferritinophagy) via disrupting the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction, which blocked the transport of cytoplasmic Fe2+ into the mitochondria via the mitochondrial membrane protein (SFXN1), further reducing the generation of mitochondrial ROS. Therefore, these findings revealed that YAP1 could inhibit ferroptosis in a ferritinophagy-mediated manner, thus alleviating sepsis-induced ALI, which may provide a new approach to the therapeutic orientation for sepsis-induced ALI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1659312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659312000,"objectID":"82d3f900e40ed8afa7cf96dd5c7d4c45","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35979359/","publishdate":"2022-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35979359/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nFerroptosis is a phospholipid peroxidation-mediated and iron-dependent cell death form, involved in sepsis-induced organ injury and other lung diseases.

Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)–a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2.

Abstract\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lethal clinical entity that has become an emergency event with the outbreak of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no well-proven pharmacotherapies except dexamethasone. This study is aimed to evaluate IRAK4 inhibitors as a potential treatment for ARDS-cytokine release syndrome (CRS). We applied two IRAK4 inhibitors, BAY-1834845 and PF-06650833 to an inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS mouse model with control of high dose dexamethasone (10 mg/kg). Unexpectedly, although both compounds had excellent IC50 on IRAK4 kinase activity, only BAY-1834845 but not PF-06650833 or high dose dexamethasone could significantly prevent lung injury according to a blinded pathology scoring. Further, only BAY-1834845 and BAY-1834845 combined with dexamethasone could effectively improve the injury score of pre-existed ARDS. Compared with PF-06650833 and high dose dexamethasone, BAY-1834845 remarkably decreased inflammatory cells infiltrating lung tissue and neutrophil count in BALF. BAY-1834845, DEX, and the combination of the two agents could decrease BALF total T cells, monocyte, and macrophages. In further cell type enrichment analysis based on lung tissue RNA-seq, both BAY-1834845 and dexamethasone decreased signatures of inflammatory cells and effector lymphocytes. Interestingly, unlike the dexamethasone group, BAY-1834845 largely preserved the signatures of naïve lymphocytes and stromal cells such as endothelial cells, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells.

Previous studies indicate that neutrophilic asthma has a poor response to standard asthma treatments comprising inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, it is important to identify critical factors that contribute to increased numbers of neutrophils in asthma patients whose symptoms are poorly controlled by conventional therapy. Leukocytes release chromatin fibers, referred to as extracellular traps (ETs) consisting of double-stranded (ds) DNA, histones, and granule contents. Excessive components of ETs contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma; however, it is unclear how ETs drive asthma phenotypes and whether they could be a potential therapeutic target. We employed a mouse model of severe asthma that recapitulates the intricate immune responses of neutrophilic and eosinophilic airway inflammation identified in patients with severe asthma. We used both a pharmacologic approach using miR-155 inhibitor-laden exosomes and genetic approaches using miR-155 knockout mice. Our data show that ETs are present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with mild asthma subjected to experimental subsegmental bronchoprovocation to an allergen and a severe asthma mouse model, which resembles the complex immune responses identified in severe human asthma. Furthermore, we show that miR-155 contributes to the extracellular release of dsDNA, which exacerbates allergic lung inflammation, and the inhibition of miR-155 results in therapeutic benefit in severe asthma mice.

Abstract\nBackground: Inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress contribute to the development of severe acute pancreatitis-associated acute lung injury (SAP-ALI). Currently, there is no curative treatment for SAP-ALI in the clinic. This study investigated the potential therapeutic role and mechanisms of colchicine in a rat model of SAP-ALI.\nMethods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized and administrated intragastrically with vehicle saline or colchicine (0.5 mg/kg/day) for seven days, followed by injecting sodium taurocholate to induce SAP-ALI. Together with a healthy control group of rats, their pancreatic and lung tissues and plasma samples were collected for histology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence.\nResults: Compared with the sham controls, the SAP group of rats with vehicle saline treatment displayed severe damages, inflammation with many neutrophil and macrophage infiltrates in pancreatic and lung tissues, accompanied by elevated levels of plasma interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which were significantly mitigated in colchicine-treated SAP + COL group of rats. Furthermore, colchicine treatment significantly attenuated nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)-p65, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 4-Hydroxynonenal expression, ROS production and cell apoptosis by decreasing caspase-3 cleavage, Bax expression, but increasing Bcl-2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in pancreatic and lung tissues, relative to the SAP group of rats.\nConclusion: Colchicine treatment significantly mitigated the severity of SAP-ALI by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in rats.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1658707200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658707200,"objectID":"46613d1e675572ef65fb03d632c550fb","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36076491/","publishdate":"2022-07-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36076491/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nInflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress play critical roles in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).

We observed a widespread lncRNAs expression alteration. Among them, the elevated expression of LINC00152 was verified and proved to be induced by enteric bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

Accordingly, we also demonstrated that overexpression of LINC00152 promoted the migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells. Consistently, we observed an increased abundance of gram-negative bacteria and LPS in tumors tissue. Taken together, the above data implicated that enriched gram-negative bacteria in tumor tissue might promote tumor growth through modulating the expression of LINC00152. Furthermore, we demonstrated that LPS upregulated the expression of LINC00152 by introducing histone lactylation on its promoter and decreasing the binding efficiency of the repressor, YY1, to it.

Additionally, the effects of Hippo/YAP signaling on alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2)-mediated alveolar epithelial recovery in VV ECMO rats were also investigated. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, RNA sequencing, lung injury, edema, and cytokine expression were evaluated.\nResults: VV ECMO significantly improved severe hypoxemia, reduced lung edema, and inflammatory response, and altered alveolar epithelial function, as indicated by reduced protein concentrations in BALF. This was associated with Hippo/YAP signaling activation, according to RNA sequencing analysis. Furthermore, we discovered that after VV ECMO, AT2 cells proliferated and differentiated, and this increase in AT2 cell activity was correlated to the increased nuclear expression of YAP, which is critical for alveolar epithelial recovery from lung injury. During VV ECMO, verteporfin-induced YAP inhibition and the loss of the oxygenator delayed lung alveolar epithelial recovery and led to a prolonged inflammatory response.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that VV ECMO protects against lung injury by activating the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway.

Identifying novel host proteins that interact with M1 and understanding their functions in IAV replication are of great interest in antiviral drug development. In this study, we identified 19 host proteins in DF1 cells suspected to interact with the M1 protein of an H5N6 virus through immunoprecipitation (IP)/mass spectrometry. Among them, PSMD12, a 26S proteasome regulatory subunit, was shown to interact with influenza M1, acting as a positive host factor in IAV replication in avian and human cells. The data showed that PSMD12 promoted K63-linked ubiquitination of M1 at the K102 site. H5N6 and PR8 with an M1-K102 site mutant displayed a significantly weaker replication ability than the wild-type viruses. Mechanistically, PSMD12 promoted M1-M2 virus-like particle (VLP) release, and an M1-K102 mutation disrupted the formation of supernatant M1-M2 VLPs. An H5N6 M1-K102 site mutation or knockdown PSMD12 disrupted the budding release of the virus in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Further study confirmed that M1-K102 site mutation significantly affected the virulence of H5N6 and PR8 viruses in mice. In conclusion, we report the novel host factor PSMD12 which affects the replication of influenza virus by mediating K63-linked ubiquitination of M1 at K102. These findings provide novel insight into the interactions between IAV and host cells, while suggesting an important target for anti-influenza virus drug research.\nImportance\nM1 is proposed to play multiple biologically important roles in the life cycle of IAV, which relies largely on host factors. This study is the first one to identify that PSMD12 interacts with M1, mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of M1 at the K102 site, and thus positively regulates influenza virus proliferation. PSMD12 promoted M1-M2 VLP egress, and an M1-K102 mutation affected the M1-M2 VLP formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of this site to the morphology and budding of influenza viruses by obtaining mutant viruses, and the M1 ubiquitination regulator PSMD12 has a similar function to the M1 K102 mutation in regulating virus release and virus morphology. Additionally, we confirm the reduced virulence of H5N6 and PR8 (H1N1) viruses carrying the M1-K102 site mutation in mice. These findings provide novel insights into IAV interactions with host cells and suggest a valid and highly conserved candidate target for antiviral drug development.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1658361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658361600,"objectID":"c2e8c672f5fab446222d0043325ec225","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35861516/","publishdate":"2022-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35861516/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nThe M1 of influenza A virus (IAV) is important for the virus life cycle, especially for the assembly and budding of viruses, which is a multistep process that requires host factors.","tags":["Immunology","Virology","Interactome","Influenza Virus","Host-Pathogen Interactions","Microbial Infections","Microbiology","Ubiquitination"],"title":"PSMD12-Mediated M1 Ubiquitination of Influenza A Virus at K102 Regulates Viral Replication","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nRationale:\nWound healing is among the most complicated physiological processes and requires the synchronization of various cell types with distinct roles to re-establish the condition of the original skin.

However, the role of SCs in wound healing are poorly understood.\nMethods:\nThe activity of SCs was investigated by using a cell atlas of the wound healing process, which was generated by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) libraries covering different states of mouse back skin. The results of in silico analysis were validated by in vitro cell culture and in vivo mouse model. Selective inhibitors and conditional RNAi by virus transfection were utilized to investigate the role of SCs in wound healing. Findings from mouse experiments were further verified in scRNA-seq analysis of diabetic patients.\nResults:\nOur in silico analysis revealed the heterogeneous cellular components of skin and the dynamic interactions of neural crest derived cells (NCs) with other cell types. We found that SCs dedifferentiated at an early stage of wound repair with upregulated Wnt signaling. We also identified dedifferentiated SC (dSC) defect in diabetic wounds in both mouse and human. Wnt inhibition at the wound site repressed SC dedifferentiation, leading to defective repair. Furthermore, dSCs derived TGF-β3, which is context-dependent, promoted the migration of fibroblasts and keratinocytes.

EVs are a heterogeneous group of lipid bilayer-covered vesicles released from virtually all cells, which have important roles in intercellular communication. Recent studies pointed out that ncRNAs including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are selectively sorted into EVs, modulating specific aspects of cancer development, namely cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, immune tolerance or drug resistance, under conditions of hypoxia in recipient cells. In myocardial infarction and stroke, ncRNAs shuttled via EVs have been shown to control tissue survival and remodeling post-hypoxia by regulating cell injury, inflammatory responses, angiogenesis, neurogenesis or neuronal plasticity. This review discusses recent evidence on EV-associated ncRNAs in hypoxic cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke, discussing their cellular origin, biological function and disease significance.

It has been estimated that 10% of metabolites found in mammalian blood are derived from the gut microbiota, where they can produce systemic effects on the host through activating or inhibiting gene expression. Currently, detailed information on target genes of gut microbes and microbial metabolites is scattered in literatures and no online repository is available for collecting these data. Here, we manually extracted microbe-metabolite, microbe-target, and metabolite-target relationships in Human and Mouse from almost 400 publications. All of these relationships were experimentally validated in vivo or in vitro and measured by RT-qPCR, high performance liquid chromatography, 16S rRNA sequence, and so on. Currently, users can:\nDownload all manually curated relationships. Achieve relationships by browsing or searching. Submit novel relationships to the gutMGene database.

This has encouraged the establishment of many analytical platforms, a portion of databases or platforms were designed to solve the special analysis needs of users, for instance, MG RAST, IMG/M, Qiita, BIGSdb, and TRAPR were developed for specific omics research, and some databases or servers provide solutions for special problems solutions.

Therefore, the demand to complete massive data processing tasks urgently requires a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis platform.

On a user-friendly interface that also supports differential analysis, the platform provides interactive customizable analysis tools, including various kinds of correlation analyses, pathway enrichment analysis, weighted correlation network analysis, and other common tools and functions, users only need to upload their own corresponding data into Sangerbox 3.0, select required parameters, submit, and wait for the results after the task has been completed. We have also established a new interactive plotting system that allows users to adjust the parameters in the image; moreover, optimized plotting performance enables users to adjust large-capacity vector maps on the web site. At the same time, we have integrated GEO, TCGA, ICGC, and other databases and processed data in batches, greatly reducing the difficulty to obtain data and improving the efficiency of bioimformatics study for users.

Prolongation of posttraumatic survival time is an effective approach to patient outcome improvement. However, there is a lack of basic research in this field. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying TCI progression and to develop novel regimens to buy time for TCI patients on the battlefield.\nMethods: A total of 669 Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Surgical colon incision was performed to generate the TCI rat model. The landscape of colon microbiota compositions was depicted using 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolites in the intestinal contents were detected by metabolomics profiling. The signaling transduction in the intestinal epithelium was investigated using antibody microarrays and Western blotting. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to measure the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in intestines and plasma for the detection of inflammatory responses. Diamine oxidase, D-lactate and endotoxin in plasma and protein expression of zonula occludens 1 and occludin were selected as the indicators of intestinal barrier permeability. To investigate alterations of microbiota symbiosis, the relative abundances of specific bacterial genera were detected using quantitative real-time PCR.\nResults: As a type of lethal injury, TCI induced acute disruption of intestinal homeostasis, characterized by inflammatory responses, intestinal barrier hyperpermeability and microbiota dysbiosis (P \u0026lt; 0.05). Significant alterations in bacterial metabolic patterns were detected with decreases in many metabolites. After a series of screenings, we found that oral administration of asparagine (Asn) and 3-indolepropionic acid (IPA) effectively prolonged posttraumatic survival time (Asn plus IPA vs. Vehicle: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.105, 95% CI 0.031-0.356, P = 0.0003) and restored intestinal homeostasis in TCI rats (P \u0026lt; 0.05). Mechanistically, this combinational strategy protected the rats against TCI through synergistic activation of Akt signaling in the intestinal epithelium (P \u0026lt; 0.05).\nConclusions: Abrupt dysregulation of intestinal homeostasis plays a critical role in the progression toward TCI-induced death. Oral administration of Asn plus IPA may serve as an effective regimen to restore intestinal functions and prolong the posttraumatic survival time.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1657065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657065600,"objectID":"05a5be73fc8a7058c93cf02b1ae3c242","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35791006/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35791006/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Traumatic colon injury (TCI) is a common disease during wartime.

Both autophagy upregulation and downregulation have been found in human cancers, suggesting a complex role in tumor development. Accumulating results from autophagy-deficient mice and mouse models of human cancers have demonstrated that autophagy generally suppresses tumor initiation, but promotes tumor progression, in a manner that is dependent on timing and context and modified by specific tumorigenic events.

CircSamd4 overexpression reduced while circSamd4 silenced increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and subsequent oxidative DNA damage. Moreover, circSamd4 overexpression induced CM proliferation and prevented CM apoptosis, which reduced the size of the fibrotic area and improved cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI).

Loss of KDM6B protein or its demethylase activity conferred cancer cell resistance to PARthanatic cell death in response to alkylating agents.

Moreover, KDM6B knockout triggered sustained Chk1 phosphorylation and activated a second XRCC1-dependent repair machinery to fix DNA damage evading from MGMT repair. Inhibition of MGMT or checkpoint response re-sensitized KDM6B deficient cells to PARthanatos induced by alkylating agents.

In vivo and in vitro functional experiments were performed to determine the suppressor role of circEXOC6B in CRC progression. RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence were applied to investigate the possible mechanisms connecting circEXOC6B to CRC growth and 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase assay, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were used to explore the mechanisms underlying the HIF1A regulation of RRAGB transcription.\nResults: circEXOC6B was downregulated in CRC tissues, and its lower expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients. Functional experiments showed that circEXOC6B inhibited growth and increased the 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circEXOC6B inhibited the heterodimer formation of RRAGB by binding to it, thereby suppressing the mTORC1 pathway and HIF1A level.

However, as a secreted protein in the circulation of patients with AKI, it is unclear whether IGFBP7 acts as a key regulator in AKI progression, and if mechanisms underlying its upregulation still need to be determined. Here we found that IGFBP7 is highly expressed in the blood and urine of patients and mice with AKI, possibly via a c-Jun-dependent mechanism, and is positively correlated with kidney dysfunction. Global knockout of IGFBP7 ameliorated kidney dysfunction, inflammatory responses, and programmed cell death in murine models of cisplatin-, kidney ischemia/reperfusion-, and lipopolysaccharide-induced AKI. IGFBP7 mainly originated from kidney tubular epithelial cells. Conditional knockout of IGFBP7 from the kidney protected against AKI. By contrast, rescue of IGFBP7 expression in IGFBP7-knockout mice restored kidney damage and inflammation. IGFBP7 function was determined in vitro using recombinant IGFBP7 protein, IGFBP7 knockdown, or overexpression. Additionally, IGFBP7 was found to bind to poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) and inhibit its degradation by antagonizing the E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 4 (RNF4). Thus, IGFBP7 in circulation acts as a biomarker and key mediator of AKI by inhibiting RNF4/PARP1-mediated tubular injury and inflammation.

VISA is regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as polyubiquitination, phosphorylation, O-linked β-d-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation), and monomethylation. However, whether other forms of PTMs regulate VISA-mediated innate immune signaling remains elusive. Here, we report that Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is a PTM of VISA, which attenuates innate immune response to RNA viruses. Using a biochemical purification approach, we identified tankyrase 1 (TNKS1) as a VISA-associated protein. Viral infection led to the induction of TNKS1 and its homolog TNKS2, which translocated from cytosol to mitochondria and interacted with VISA. TNKS1 and TNKS2 catalyze the PARylation of VISA at Glu137 residue, thereby priming it for K48-linked polyubiquitination by the E3 ligase Ring figure protein 146 (RNF146) and subsequent degradation. Consistently, TNKS1, TNKS2, or RNF146 deficiency increased the RNA virus-triggered induction of downstream effector genes and impaired the replication of the virus. Moreover, TNKS1- or TNKS2-deficient mice produced higher levels of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines after virus infection and markedly reduced virus loads in the brains and lungs. Together, our findings uncover an essential role of PARylation of VISA in virus-triggered innate immune signaling, which represents a mechanism to avoid excessive harmful immune response.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1655769600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655769600,"objectID":"372ac8c4a4c847faee69a0ed2fe05417","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35733260/","publishdate":"2022-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35733260/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nDuring viral infection, sensing of viral RNA by retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors (RLRs) initiates an antiviral innate immune response, which is mediated by the mitochondrial adaptor protein VISA (virus-induced signal adaptor; also known as mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein [MAVS]).","tags":["Microbiology","Microbial Infections","Virology","Interactome","Host-Pathogen Interactions","PARylation","Ubiquitination"],"title":"Tankyrases inhibit innate antiviral response by PARylating VISA/MAVS and priming it for RNF146-mediated ubiquitination and degradation","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nPodocyte injury is a hallmark of glomerular diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

Recent evidence indicates the crucial roles of excessive stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling activation during sepsis. However, the role of STING signaling in septic liver injury remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that STING signaling was markedly activated in KCs isolated from wild type mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. STING deficiency effectively protected liver function, attenuated systemic inflammatory response and decreased mortality in LPS-treated mice, which were aggravated by STING agonist (DMXAA). Importantly, STING signaling activation in KCs contributed to LPS-induced liver injury through promoting hepatocyte death. Mechanistically, STING signaling could be activated by release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) through dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-dependent mitochondrial fission in LPS-treated KCs. Additionally, LPS stimulation enhanced DRP1-dependent mitochondrial ROS production, which promoted the leak of mtDNA into the cytosol and subsequent STING signaling activation in KCs. The in vivo experiments showed that pharmacological inhibition of DRP1 with Mdivi-1 partially prevented the activation of STING signaling in KCs isolated from LPS-challenged mice, as well as alleviated liver injury and inhibited systemic inflammatory response. In summary, our study comprehensively confirmed that STING signaling senses the DRP1-dependent release of mtDNA in KCs and its activation might play a key role in LPS-induced liver injury, which offers new sights and therapeutic targets for management of septic liver injury.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1655251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655251200,"objectID":"01d26ef3b3b7f3fdfe81d435915427b6","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35724543/","publishdate":"2022-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35724543/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nAberrant pro-inflammatory activation of Kupffer cells (KCs) is strongly involved in the pathogenesis of septic liver injury.

Abstract\nNormothermic ex vivo lung perfusion (NEVLP) has emerged as a modernized organ preservation technique that allows for detailed assessment of donor lung function prior to transplantation. The main goal of this study was to identify potential biomarkers of lung function and/or injury during a prolonged (19 h) NEVLP procedure using in vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technology followed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). The use of minimally invasive in vivo SPME fibers for repeated sampling of biological tissue permits the monitoring and evaluation of biochemical changes and alterations in the metabolomic profile of the lung. These in vivo SPME fibers were directly introduced into the lung and were also used to extract metabolites (on-site SPME) from fresh perfusate samples collected alongside lung samplings. A subsequent goal of the study was to assess the feasibility of SPME as an in vivo method in metabolomics studies, in comparison to the traditional in-lab metabolomics workflow. Several upregulated biochemical pathways involved in pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, as well as lipid metabolism, were observed during extended lung perfusion, especially between the 11th and 12th hours of the procedure, in both lung and perfusate samples. However, several unstable and/or short-lived metabolites, such as neuroprostanes, have been extracted from lung tissue in vivo using SPME fibers.

SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in a low-glucose culture medium for 4 h under hypoxic conditions and then transferred to normal conditions for 12 h. Then, cerebral blood flow, mitochondrial structure, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagic flux, aggresome and exosome expression profiles, cardiac tissue structure, mitochondrial length and cristae density, mtDNA and ROS content, as well as the expression of Drp1-Ser616/Drp1, RIP1/RIP3, LC3 II/LC3 I, TNF-α, IL-1β, etc., were detected under normal or Drp1 interference conditions.\nResults: The mtDNA content, ROS levels, and Drp1-Ser616/Drp1 were elevated by 2.2, 1.7 and 2.7 times after CIRI (P \u0026lt; 0.05). However, the high cytoplasmic LC3 II/I ratio and increased aggregation of p62 could be reversed by 44% and 88% by Drp1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (P \u0026lt; 0.05). The low fluorescence intensity of autophagic flux and the increased phosphorylation of RIP3 induced by CIRI could be attenuated by ROS scavenger, NAC (P \u0026lt; 0.05). RIP1/RIP3 inhibitor Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) restored 75% to a low LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and enhanced 2 times to a high RFP-LC3 after Drp1 activation (P \u0026lt; 0.05). In addition, although CIRI-induced ROS production caused no considerable accumulation of autophagosomes (P \u0026gt; 0.05), it increased the packaging and extracellular secretion of exosomes containing p62 by 4 - 5 times, which could be decreased by Mdivi-1, Drp1 shRNA, and Nec-1 (P \u0026lt; 0.05).

Dysregulated expression of miRNAs and increased formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and apoptosis participate in autoimmune-mediated diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), mostly associated with pulmonary capillaritis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. In particular, besides the inhibition of apoptosis, miR-146a can control innate and acquired immune responses, and regulate the toll-like receptor pathway through targeting TRAF6 to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines like IL-8, a NETosis inducer.\nMethods: Expression of miR-146a, TRAF6 and NETs were examined in peripheral blood neutrophils (PBNs) and lung tissues from SLE-associated DAH patients, and in neutrophils and pristane-induced DAH lung tissues from C57BL/6 mice. To assess NETs formation, we examined NETosis-related DNAs morphology and crucial mediators including protein arginine deiminase 4 and citrullinated Histone 3. Expression of miR-146a and its endogenous RNA SNHG16 were studied in HL-60 promyelocytic cells and MLE-12 alveolar cells during NETosis and apoptosis processes, respectively. MiR-146a-overexpressed and CRISPR-Cas13d-mediated SNHG16-silenced HL-60 cells were investigated for NETosis. MiR-146a-overexpressed MLE-12 cells were analyzed for apoptosis. Pristane-injected mice received intra-pulmonary miR-146a delivery to evaluate therapeutic efficacy in DAH.\nResults: In DAH patients, there were down-regulated miR-146a levels with increased TRAF6 expression and PMA/LPS-induced NETosis in PBNs, and down-regulated miR-146a levels with increased TRAF6, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), IL-8, NETs and apoptosis expression in lung tissues. HMGB1-stimulated mouse neutrophils had down-regulated miR-146a levels with increased TRAF6, IL-8 and NETs expression. PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells had down-regulated miR-146a levels with enhanced NETosis. MiR-146a-overexpressed or SNHG16-silenced HL-60 cells showed reduced NETosis. Apoptotic MLE-12 cells had down-regulated miR-146a expression and increased HMGB1 release, while miR-146a-overexpressed MLE-12 cells showed reduced apoptosis and HMGB1 production. There were down-regulated miR-146a levels with increased TRAF6, HMGB1, IL-8, NETs and apoptosis expression in mouse DAH lung tissues. Intra-pulmonary miR-146a delivery could suppress DAH by reducing TRAF6, IL-8, NETs and apoptosis expression.\nConclusions: Our results demonstrate firstly down-regulated pulmonary miR-146a levels with increased TRAF6 and IL-8 expression and NETs and apoptosis formation in autoimmune-mediated DAH, and implicate a therapeutic potential of intra-pulmonary miR-146a delivery.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1653523200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653523200,"objectID":"323f49bbb8414e14f3e2d43fdbe7325f","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36028828/","publishdate":"2022-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36028828/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Increasing evidences have suggested an important role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating cell death processes including NETosis and apoptosis.

In humans, a lack of ROS causes chronic and extreme bacterial infections, while uncontrolled release of these factors causes pathologies due to excessive inflammation. Professional phagocytes such as neutrophils (PMNs), eosinophils, monocytes, and macrophages use superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase (NOX) as part of their arsenal of antimicrobial mechanisms to produce high levels of ROS. NOX is a multisubunit enzyme complex composed of five essential subunits, two of which are localized in the membrane, while three are localized in the cytosol. In resting phagocytes, the oxidase complex is unassembled and inactive; however, it becomes activated after cytosolic components translocate to the membrane and are assembled into a functional oxidase. The NOX isoforms play a variety of roles in cellular differentiation, development, proliferation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal control, migration, and contraction. Recent studies have identified NOX as a major contributor to disease pathologies, resulting in a shift in focus on inhibiting the formation of potentially harmful free radicals. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and the transduction pathways involved in NOX-mediated signaling is essential for the development of new therapeutic agents that minimize the hyperproduction of ROS. The current review provides a thorough overview of the various NOX enzymes and their roles in disease pathophysiology, highlights pharmacological strategies, and discusses the importance of computational modeling for future NOX-related studies.\n\u0026lt; Back to Reviews Alternative to Homepage ","date":1652832000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652832000,"objectID":"c896c1fad31d3566a03f5a505a21c4ba","permalink":"https://example.com/review/35585127/","publishdate":"2022-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/review/35585127/","section":"review","summary":"Abstract\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) are pervasive signaling molecules in biological systems.

Genetic, transcriptional and translational heterogeneity contributes to this dynamic process. Metabolic heterogeneity has also been observed, yet its role in cancer progression is less explored. Here we find that the loss of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) potentiates metastatic dissemination. Specifically, we find that heterogeneous or low PHGDH expression in primary tumours of patients with breast cancer is associated with decreased metastasis-free survival time. In mice, circulating tumour cells and early metastatic lesions are enriched with Phgdhlow cancer cells, and silencing Phgdh in primary tumours increases metastasis formation. Mechanistically, Phgdh interacts with the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase, and the loss of this interaction activates the hexosamine-sialic acid pathway, which provides precursors for protein glycosylation. As a consequence, aberrant protein glycosylation occurs, including increased sialylation of integrin αvβ3, which potentiates cell migration and invasion. Inhibition of sialylation counteracts the metastatic ability of Phgdhlow cancer cells. In conclusion, although the catalytic activity of PHGDH supports cancer cell proliferation, low PHGDH protein expression non-catalytically potentiates cancer dissemination and metastasis formation. Thus, the presence of PHDGH heterogeneity in primary tumours could be considered a sign of tumour aggressiveness.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1652832000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652832000,"objectID":"89068509b0ee63458503c6f0944da356","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35585241/","publishdate":"2022-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35585241/","section":"article","summary":"Erratum in:\nAuthor Correction: PHGDH heterogeneity potentiates cancer cell dissemination and metastasis.\nAbstract\nCancer metastasis requires the transient activation of cellular programs enabling dissemination and seeding in distant organs.

We show that terminal sialylation of glycans on intestinal mucus by ST6GALNAC1 (ST6), the dominant sialyltransferase specifically expressed in goblet cells and induced by microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns, is essential for mucus integrity and protecting against excessive bacterial proteolytic degradation. Glycoproteomic profiling and biochemical analysis of ST6 mutations identified in patients show that decreased sialylation causes defective mucus proteins and congenital inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mice harboring a patient ST6 mutation have compromised mucus barriers, dysbiosis, and susceptibility to intestinal inflammation.

A myriad of facets linking amino acid, lipid, redox, and iron metabolisms were found to drive or to suppress the execution of ferroptosis. However, how the cells decipher the diverse pro-ferroptotic stress to activate ferroptosis remains elusive. Here, we report that protein O-GlcNAcylation, the primary nutrient sensor of glucose flux, orchestrates both ferritinophagy and mitophagy for ferroptosis. Following the treatment of ferroptosis stimuli such as RSL3, a commonly used ferroptosis inducer, there exists a biphasic change of protein O-GlcNAcylation to modulate ferroptosis. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation promoted ferritinophagy, resulting in the accumulation of labile iron towards mitochondria. Inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation resulted in mitochondria fragmentation and enhanced mitophagy, providing an additional source of labile iron and rendering the cell more sensitive to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, we found that de-O-GlcNAcylation of the ferritin heavy chain at S179 promoted its interaction with NCOA4, the ferritinophagy receptor, thereby accumulating labile iron for ferroptosis.

Here, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 (also known as MARCHF8, c-MIR, and RNF178) as a negative regulator of cGAS-mediated signaling. The immune response to double-stranded DNA was attenuated by overexpression of MARCH8 and enhanced by knockdown or knockout of MARCH8. MARCH8 interacted with the enzymatically active core of cGAS through its conserved RING-CH domain and catalyzed the lysine-63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitylation of cGAS at Lys411. This polyubiquitylation event inhibited the DNA binding ability of cGAS, impaired cGAMP production, and attenuated the downstream innate immune response. Furthermore, March8-deficient mice were less susceptible than their wild-type counterparts to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection.

The functional role of LNC01606 was investigated by gain- and loss-of-function assays both in vitro and in vivo. The LINC01606-SCD1-Wnt/β-catenin-TFE3 axis were screened and validated by DNA/RNA pull down, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter.\nResults: The expression of lncRNA LINC01606 was frequently upregulated in human colon cancer and strongly associated with a poor prognosis. LINC01606 functioned as an oncogene and promotes colon cancer cell growth, invasion and stemness both in vitro and in vivo.

QRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in human PDAC tissues and their matched normal tissues. The interaction between circ-MTHFD1L and miR-615-3p/RPN6 signal axis was confirmed by a series of experiments such as Dual-luciferase reporter assay, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays.\nResults: Circ-MTHFD1L was significantly increased in PDAC tissues and cells.

Tyro-phosphorylation of LATS1 promotes LATS1 activation and YAP degradation, thereby promoting IFN-mediated antiproliferation activity.

Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)–a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2.

STING-mediated immunity could be exploited in the development of vaccines or cancer immunotherapies. STING is a transmembrane dimeric protein that is located in the endoplasmic reticulum or in the Golgi apparatus. STING is activated by the binding of its cytoplasmic ligand-binding domain to cyclic dinucleotides that are produced by the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase or by invading bacteria. Cyclic dinucleotides induce a conformational change in the STING ligand-binding domain, which leads to a high-order oligomerization of STING that is essential for triggering the downstream signalling pathways. However, the cGAMP-induced STING oligomers tend to dissociate in solution and have not been resolved to high resolution, which limits our understanding of the activation mechanism. Here we show that a small-molecule agonist, compound 53 (C53), promotes the oligomerization and activation of human STING through a mechanism orthogonal to that of cGAMP. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of STING bound to both C53 and cGAMP, revealing a stable oligomer that is formed by side-by-side packing and has a curled overall shape. Notably, C53 binds to a cryptic pocket in the STING transmembrane domain, between the two subunits of the STING dimer. This binding triggers outward shifts of transmembrane helices in the dimer, and induces inter-dimer interactions between these helices to mediate the formation of the high-order oligomer.

Following acute PAF1 degradation, most destabilized polymerase undergoes effective release, which presumably relies on skewed balance between INTAC and P-TEFb, resulting in hyperphosphorylated substrates including SPT5. Impaired Pol II progression during elongation, along with altered pause release frequency, determines the final transcriptional outputs. Moreover, PAF1 degradation causes a cumulative decline in histone modifications.

How excess copper induces cell death, however, is unknown. Here, we show in human cells that copper-dependent, regulated cell death is distinct from known death mechanisms and is dependent on mitochondrial respiration. We show that copper-dependent death occurs by means of direct binding of copper to lipoylated components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This results in lipoylated protein aggregation and subsequent iron-sulfur cluster protein loss, which leads to proteotoxic stress and ultimately cell death. These findings may explain the need for ancient copper homeostatic mechanisms.\nCopper induces cell death\nCell death is an essential, finely tuned process that is critical for the removal of damaged and superfluous cells. Multiple forms of programmed and nonprogrammed cell death have been identified, including apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis.

By performing CRISPR/Cas9 screens, several genes were identified that could protect against copper-induced cell killing.

After first detecting elevated histone lactylation in brain samples from both 5XFAD mice and individuals with AD, we observed that H4K12la levels are elevated in Aβ plaque-adjacent microglia. This lactate-dependent histone modification is enriched at the promoters of glycolytic genes and activates transcription, thereby increasing glycolytic activity. Ultimately, the glycolysis/H4K12la/PKM2 positive feedback loop exacerbates microglial dysfunction in AD. Pharmacologic inhibition of PKM2 attenuated microglial activation, and microglia-specific ablation of Pkm2 improved spatial learning and memory in AD mice.

The HECT domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase HUWE1 (also known as MULE) was initially shown to promote apoptosis. However, our preliminary study demonstrates that high expression of HUWE1 in the liver donors corelates with less injury and better hepatic function after liver transplantation in patients. Thus, we investigate the role of HUWE1 in acute liver injury, and identify HUWE1 as a negative ferroptosis modulator through transferrin receptor 1(TfR1). Deficiency of Huwe1 in mice hepatocytes (HKO) exacerbated I/R and CCl4-induced liver injury with more ferroptosis occurrence. Moreover, Suppression of Huwe1 remarkably enhances cellular sensitivity to ferroptosis in primary hepatocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Mechanistically, HUWE1 specifically targets TfR1 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby regulates iron metabolism. Importantly, chemical and genetic inhibition of TfR1 dramatically diminishes the ferroptotic cell death in Huwe1 KO cells and Huwe1 HKO mice. Therefore, HUWE1 is a potential protective factor to antagonize both aberrant iron accumulation and ferroptosis thereby mitigating acute liver injury. These findings may provide clinical implications for patients with the high-expression Huwe1 alleles.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1646697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646697600,"objectID":"79100edfd7ec9e34aa9801f20dee9fee","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35260822/","publishdate":"2022-03-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35260822/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nHepatic ischemia followed by reperfusion (I/R), a major clinical problem during liver surgical procedures, can induce liver injury with severe cell death including ferroptosis which is characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxidation.","tags":["Cell Death","Ferroptosis","Tissue Injury","Liver"],"title":"Ubiquitin ligase E3 HUWE1/MULE targets transferrin receptor for degradation and suppresses ferroptosis in acute liver injury","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Highlights\nVerteporfin (YAP inhibitor) treatment yields wound regeneration in mice Divergent molecular pathways of scarring versus regeneration are defined by differential mechanical versus Wnt signaling Trps1 drives wound regeneration in the context of blocked mechanical signaling Summary\nRegeneration is the holy grail of tissue repair, but skin injury typically yields fibrotic, non-functional scars. Developing pro-regenerative therapies requires rigorous understanding of the molecular progression from injury to fibrosis or regeneration. Here, we report the divergent molecular events driving skin wound cells toward scarring or regenerative fates. We profile scarring versus YAP-inhibition-induced wound regeneration at the transcriptional (single-cell RNA sequencing), protein (timsTOF proteomics), and tissue (extracellular matrix ultrastructural analysis) levels. Using cell-surface barcoding, we integrate these data to reveal fibrotic and regenerative “molecular trajectories” of healing. We show that disrupting YAP mechanotransduction yields regenerative repair by fibroblasts with activated Trps1 and Wnt signaling. Finally, via in vivo gene knockdown and overexpression in wounds, we identify Trps1 as a key regulatory gene that is necessary and partially sufficient for wound regeneration.

Mechanical damage to the lungs is potentially aggravated by the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This article describes RAS activation profiles in VILI and discusses the effects of angiotensin (Ang) 1-7 supplementation or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril as protective strategies.\nDesign: Animal study.\nSetting: University research laboratory.\nSubjects: C57BL/6 mice.\nInterventions: Anesthetized mice ( n = 12-18 per group) were mechanically ventilated with low tidal volume (LV T , 6 mL/kg), high tidal volume (HV T , 15 mL/kg), or very high tidal volume (VHV T , 30 mL/kg) for 4 hours, or killed after 3 minutes (sham). Additional VHV T groups received infusions of 60 μg/kg/hr Ang 1-7 or a single dose of 100 mg/kg captopril.\nMeasurements and main results: VILI was characterized by increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of interleukin (IL)-6, keratinocyte-derived cytokine, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP2). The Ang metabolites in plasma measured with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry showed a strong activation of the classical (Ang I, Ang II) and alternative RAS (Ang 1-7, Ang 1-5), with highest concentrations found in the HV T group. Although the lung-tissue ACE messenger RNA expression was unchanged, its protein expression showed a dose-dependent increase under mechanical ventilation. The ACE2 messenger RNA expression decreased in all ventilated groups, whereas ACE2 protein levels remained unchanged. Both captopril and Ang 1-7 led to markedly increased Ang 1-7 plasma levels, decreased Ang II levels, and ACE activity (Ang II/Ang I ratio), and effectively prevented VILI.\nConclusions: VILI is accompanied by a strong activation of the RAS. Based on circulating Ang metabolite levels and tissue expression of RAS enzymes, classical ACE-dependent and alternative RAS cascades were activated in the HV T group, whereas classical RAS activation prevailed with VHV T ventilation. Ang 1-7 or captopril protected from VILI primarily by modifying the systemic RAS profile.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1645488000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645488000,"objectID":"84b26ba585721e3bc35a7176f99f343f","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35191411/","publishdate":"2022-02-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35191411/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nObjectives: Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.

However, the elimination of intracellular bacteria is challenging as they are protected from antibiotics and host immune attack. Recent studies have indicated that iron helps macrophages against intracellular bacteria, contradictory to traditional “nutritional immunity”, in which iron is considered a key nutrient for bacterial survival in host cells. However, how iron facilitates intracellular bacterial death has not been fully clarified. In this study, we found that ferroptotic stress can help macrophages suppress intracellular bacteria by reversing the importation of ferrous iron into bacterial vacuoles via ferroportin and thereby inducing in situ ferroptosis-like bacterial death.\nMethods:\nA macrophage model of bacterial invasion was established to monitor dynamic changes in ferroptotic hallmarks, including ferrous iron and lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis inducers and inhibitors were added to the model to evaluate the relationship between ferroptotic stress and intracellular bacterial survival. We then determined the spatiotemporal distributions of ferroportin, ferrous iron, and lipid peroxidation in macrophages and intracellular bacteria. A bacterial infection mouse model was established to evaluate the therapeutic effects of drugs that regulate ferroptotic stress.\nResults:\nFerrous iron and lipid peroxidation increased sharply in the early stage of bacterial infection in the macrophages, then decreased to normal levels in the late stage of infection. The addition of ferroptosis inducers (ras-selective lethal small molecule 3, sulfasalazine, and acetaminophen) in macrophages promoted intracellular bacterial suppression. Further studies revealed that ferrous iron could be delivered to the intracellular bacterial compartment via inward ferroportin transportation, where ferrous iron induced ferroptosis-like death of bacteria. In addition, ferroptotic stress declined to normal levels in the late stage of infection by regulating iron-related pathways in the macrophages. Importantly, we found that enhancing ferroptotic stress with a ferroptosis inducer (sulfasalazine) successfully suppressed bacteria in the mouse infection models.\nConclusions:\nOur study suggests that the spatiotemporal response to ferroptosis stress is an efficient pathway for macrophage defense against bacterial invasion, and targeting ferroptosis may achieve therapeutic targets for infectious diseases challenged by intracellular pathogens.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1645401600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645401600,"objectID":"7eb1b258a5594fc587b56593a20abb43","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35265210/","publishdate":"2022-02-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35265210/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nRational:\nIntracellular bacterial survival is a major factor causing chronic or recurrent infection, leading to the failure of both host defense and/or antibiotic treatment.

Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)–a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1645056000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645056000,"objectID":"26551e8b7051954eecc3d965ab3d57ab","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35865095/","publishdate":"2022-02-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35865095/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nTherapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer.

Long-term exposure to coal dust leads to a complex alternation of biological processes during regeneration and repair in the healing lung. However, the cellular and complete molecular changes associated with pulmonary homeostasis caused by respiratory coal dust particles remain unclear.\nMethods: This study mainly investigated the pulmonary toxicity of respirable-sized CDP in mice using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing. CDP (\u0026lt; 5 μm) collected from the coal mine was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Mass Spectrometer. In addition, western blotting, Elisa, QPCR was used to detect gene expression at mRNA or protein levels. Pathological analysis including HE staining, Masson staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to characterize the structure and functional alternation in the pneumoconiosis mouse and verify the reliability of single-cell sequencing results.\nResults: SEM image and Mass Spectrometer analysis showed that coal dust particles generated during coal mine production have been crushed and screened with a diameter of less than 5 µm and contained less than 10% silica. Alveolar structure and pulmonary microenvironment were destroyed, inflammatory and death (apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis) pathways were activated, leading to pneumoconiosis in post 9 months coal dust stimulation. A distinct abnormally increased alveolar type 2 epithelial cell (AT2) were classified with a highly active state but reduced the antimicrobial-related protein expression of LYZ and Chia1 after CDP exposure. Beclin1, LC3B, LAMP2, TGF-ß, and MLPH were up-regulated induced by CDP, promoting autophagy and pulmonary fibrosis. A new subset of macrophages with M2-type polarization double expressed MLPH + /CD206 + was found in mice having pneumoconiosis but markedly decreased after the Vitamin D treatment. Activated MLPH + /CD206 + M2 macrophages secreted TGF-β1 and are sensitive to Vitamin D treatment.\nConclusions: This is the first study to reconstruct the pathologic progression and transcriptome pattern of coal pneumoconiosis in mice. Coal dust had obvious toxic effects on lung epithelial cells and macrophages and eventually induced pulmonary fibrosis. CDP-induced M2-type macrophages could be inhibited by VD, which may be related to the alleviation of the pulmonary fibrosis process.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1642636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642636800,"objectID":"a155469e452c0052a2cd9a358ad3c61e","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35057792/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35057792/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Coal dust particles (CDP), an inevitable by-product of coal mining for the environment, mainly causes coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP).

To carry out these diverse functions, mitochondria must communicate with the cytosol, a task mediated by the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), the gateway between mitochondria and the rest of the cell. Thus, preserving the integrity of the OMM is essential for cellular homeostasis. Although responses to stress that is artificially induced by small molecules have been described, little is known of the mechanisms by which mammalian cells respond to naturally occurring stresses of the OMM.\nRATIONALE\nSeveral intracellular microbes come in contact with the host OMM or release proteins that target the OMM. We reasoned that microbial infection would serve as a model with which to study cellular responses to natural OMM stress. To this end, we chose the human parasite Toxoplasma gondii because it tethers host mitochondria to its parasite vacuole; in an infected cell, areas of close membrane apposition form between the host OMM and the parasite vacuole membrane. To address how Toxoplasma affected the OMM, we performed live-cell imaging of infected mammalian cells stably expressing OMM-targeted green fluorescent protein (GFP). We found that mitochondria in contact with the Toxoplasma vacuole released large structures that were positive for OMM, which we termed “SPOTs.” Analysis of SPOTs in fixed and live cells revealed that SPOTs did not contain proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM).\nRESULTS\nHaving identified Toxoplasma infection as a natural stress that induced OMM remodeling and the shedding of SPOTs, we next dissected how these structures are formed. We found that the secreted effector protein TgMAF1 (Toxoplasma gondii mitochondrial association factor 1), which tethers the host OMM to the parasite vacuole membrane, was required for SPOT formation. TgMAF1 led to a decrease in the amount of mitochondrial proteins during infection. In particular, the OMM proteins mitofusin 1 and mitofusin 2 were degraded during infection. These proteins, which mediate a nutritional defense against Toxoplasma by promoting mitochondrial uptake of fatty acids, localized to SPOTs. The ability of TgMAF1 to induce SPOTs depended on its binding to the host OMM import receptor TOM70 (translocase of the outer membrane 70), whose import function TgMAF1 impaired. TOM70 was required for optimal parasite growth and enabled an interaction between TgMAF1 and the OMM translocase SAM50 (sorting assembly machinery 50 kDa subunit), which is a key component of the OMM-IMM mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex. The genetic ablation of SAM50 and the overexpression of an OMM-targeted protein induced the formation of SPOT-like structures independently of infection.\nCONCLUSION\nBecause SAM50 is the only component of mitochondrial import machinery that bridges the OMM and IMM, it is in a position to translate OMM stress into the removal of compromised OMM. TgMAF1 behaves as a mitochondrial preprotein that uses the host receptor TOM70 to interact with SAM50. This enables Toxoplasma to hijack a cellular response to OMM stress—the formation of SPOTs—and drive the constitutive shedding of the OMM. Consequently, levels of mitochondrial proteins that restrict parasite growth are depleted, and import machinery that is required for mitochondrial biogenesis is sequestered on SPOTs. In an infection-independent context, however, we propose that SPOT-like structures could mitigate OMM stress by enabling the excision of dysfunctional OMM machinery, such as import receptors or translocases during defective import. Our finding that OMM remodeling occurs during infection and infection-independent scenarios sheds light on potential cellular mechanisms that safeguard OMM function.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1642118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642118400,"objectID":"3a82af9875116893ded5c914997f6dd9","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35025629/","publishdate":"2022-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35025629/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nINTRODUCTION\nMitochondria are dynamic organelles that coordinate many cellular functions that are essential for life, including diverse metabolic processes, cell division and differentiation, and immune signaling.

We screened the gut microbiota targets of berberine and showed that the molecular mechanism of berberine-mediated treatment of metabolic syndrome involves the regulation of gut microbiota structure and the expression of inflammatory factors. Our results revealed that a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly changed mice gut microbiota, thereby probably increasing the level of toxins in the intestine, and triggered the host inflammatory response. The HFD also reduced the proportion of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing genes, thereby hindering mucosal immunity and cell nutrition, and increased the host inflammatory response and liver fat metabolism disorders. Further, berberine could improve the chronic HFD-induced inflammatory metabolic syndrome to some extent and effectively improved the metabolism of high-fat foods in mice, which correlated with the gut microbiota composition.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an interconnected network of diverse morphologies that extends promiscuously throughout the cytoplasm, forming abundant contacts with other organelles. Dysregulation of endoplasmic reticulum morphology is tightly linked to neurologic disorders and cancer. Here we demonstrate that three membrane-bound endoplasmic reticulum proteins preferentially interact with different microtubule populations, with CLIMP63 binding centrosome microtubules, kinectin (KTN1) binding perinuclear polyglutamylated microtubules, and p180 binding glutamylated microtubules. Knockout of these proteins or manipulation of microtubule populations and glutamylation status results in marked changes in endoplasmic reticulum positioning, leading to similar redistributions of other organelles.

This prompted us to comprehensively dissect the interplay between the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift element and the host proteome. We reveal that the short isoform of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP-S) is a direct regulator of PRF in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. ZAP-S overexpression strongly impairs frameshifting and inhibits viral replication. Using in vitro ensemble and single-molecule techniques, we further demonstrate that ZAP-S directly interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and interferes with the folding of the frameshift RNA element.

Numbers of mechanisms contribute to gene expression regulation, thus, systematically identification of potential regulons of immune-related pathways is critical to cancer immunotherapy. Here, we comprehensively chart the landscape of transcription factors, microRNAs, RNA binding proteins and long noncoding RNAs regulation in 17 immune-related pathways across 33 cancers. The potential immunology regulons are likely to exhibit higher expressions in immune cells, show expression perturbations in cancer, and are significantly correlated with immune cell infiltrations. We also identify a panel of clinically relevant immunology regulons across cancers. Moreover, the regulon atlas of immune-related pathways helps prioritizing cancer-related genes (i.e. ETV7, miR-146a-5p, ZFP36 and HCP5). We further identified two molecular subtypes of glioma (cold and hot tumour phenotypes), which were characterized by differences in immune cell infiltrations, expression of checkpoints, and prognosis. Finally, we developed a user-friendly resource, ImmReg, with multiple modules to visualize, browse, and download immunology regulation.

Platelet-neutrophil interactions can promote neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. The goals of this study were to assess the role of NETs in atherosclerosis and thrombosis in mice with hematopoietic Lnk deficiency.\nMethods: We bred mice with combined deficiency of Lnk and the NETosis-essential enzyme PAD4 (peptidyl arginine deiminase 4) and transplanted their bone marrow into Ldlr-/- mice. We evaluated the role of LNK in atherothrombosis in humans and mice bearing a gain of function variant in JAK2 (JAK2V617F).\nResults: Lnk-deficient mice displayed accelerated carotid artery thrombosis with prominent NETosis that was completely reversed by PAD4 deficiency. Thrombin-activated Lnk-/- platelets promoted increased NETosis when incubated with Lnk-/- neutrophils compared with wild-type platelets or wild-type neutrophils. This involved increased surface exposure and release of oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) from Lnk-/- platelets, as well as increased priming and response of Lnk-/- neutrophils to OxPL. To counteract the effects of OxPL, we introduced a transgene expressing the single-chain variable fragment of E06 (E06-scFv). E06-scFv reversed accelerated NETosis, atherosclerosis, and thrombosis in Lnk-/- mice. We also showed increased NETosis when human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived LNK(TT) neutrophils were incubated with LNK(TT) platelet/megakaryocytes, but not in isogenic LNK(CC) controls, confirming human relevance. Using data from the UK Biobank, we found that individuals with the JAK2VF mutation only showed increased risk of coronary artery disease when also carrying the LNK R262W allele. Mice with hematopoietic Lnk+/- and Jak2VF clonal hematopoiesis showed accelerated arterial thrombosis but not atherosclerosis compared with Jak2VFLnk+/+ controls.\nConclusions: Hematopoietic Lnk deficiency promotes NETosis and arterial thrombosis in an OxPL-dependent fashion. LNK(R262W) reduces LNK function in human platelets and neutrophils, promoting NETosis, and increases coronary artery disease risk in humans carrying Jak2VF mutations. Therapies targeting OxPL may be beneficial for coronary artery disease in genetically defined human populations.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1638230400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638230400,"objectID":"167398fa76e395adae29039834ddbce8","permalink":"https://example.com/article/34846914/","publishdate":"2021-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/34846914/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: LNK/SH2B3 inhibits Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling by hematopoietic cytokine receptors.

Here, we report that the RNA-binding protein RBMS1 participates in lung cancer development via mediating ferroptosis evasion. Through an shRNA-mediated systematic screen, we discovered that RBMS1 is a key ferroptosis regulator. Clinically, RBMS1 was elevated in lung cancer and its high expression was associated with reduced patient survival. Conversely, depletion of RBMS1 inhibited lung cancer progression both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, RBMS1 interacted with the translation initiation factor eIF3d directly to bridge the 3’- and 5’-UTR of SLC7A11. RBMS1 ablation inhibited the translation of SLC7A11, reduced SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake, and promoted ferroptosis. In a drug screen that targeted RBMS1, we further uncovered that nortriptyline hydrochloride decreased the level of RBMS1, thereby promoting ferroptosis. Importantly, RBMS1 depletion or inhibition by nortriptyline hydrochloride sensitized radioresistant lung cancer cells to radiotherapy.

Thus, TRAF6 functions as a molecular brake for MALT1 protease in resting T cells and a signaling accelerator for MALT1 scaffolding in activated T cells, revealing that TRAF6 controls T cell activation in a switch-like manner.

Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)–a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2.

The ECM provides three-dimensional (3D) architectural support to the lung and crucial biochemical and biophysical cues to the cells, directing cellular processes. As immune cells travel to reach any site of injury, they encounter the composition and various mechanical features of the ECM.

In this review article, we discuss how different inhibitors of autophagy may influence the secretion of EVs and summarize the non-specific effects of autophagy inhibitors with a focus on endosome-related secretory pathways.

However, the role of caspase-11-mediated pyroptosis in S. flexneri infection is unknown. Here we show that caspase-11 did not protect mice from S. flexneri infection, in contrast to infection with another cytosolic bacterium, Burkholderia thailandensis. S. flexneri evaded pyroptosis mediated by caspase-11 or caspase 4 (hereafter referred to as caspase-11/4) using a type III secretion system (T3SS) effector, OspC3. OspC3, but not its paralogues OspC1 and 2, covalently modified caspase-11/4; although it used the NAD+ donor, this modification was not ADP-ribosylation. Biochemical dissections uncovered an ADP-riboxanation modification on Arg314 and Arg310 in caspase-4 and caspase-11, respectively. The enzymatic activity was shared by OspC1 and 2, whose ankyrin-repeat domains, unlike that of OspC3, could not recognize caspase-11/4. ADP-riboxanation of the arginine blocked autoprocessing of caspase-4/11 as well as their recognition and cleavage of GSDMD.

A subset of COVID-19 patients experience systemic inflammatory response, known as cytokine storm, which may lead to death. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is an important mediator of inflammation and cell death. Here, we examined the interaction of RIPK1-mediated innate immunity with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found evidence of RIPK1 activation in human COVID-19 lung pathological samples, and cultured human lung organoids and ACE2 transgenic mice infected by SARS-CoV-2. Inhibition of RIPK1 using multiple small-molecule inhibitors reduced the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in human lung organoids. Furthermore, therapeutic dosing of the RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1s reduced mortality and lung viral load, and blocked the CNS manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2 transgenic mice. Mechanistically, we found that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2, NSP12, a highly conserved central component of coronaviral replication and transcription machinery, promoted the activation of RIPK1. Furthermore, NSP12 323L variant, encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 C14408T variant first detected in Lombardy, Italy, that carries a Pro323Leu amino acid substitution in NSP12, showed increased ability to activate RIPK1. Inhibition of RIPK1 downregulated the transcriptional induction of proinflammatory cytokines and host factors including ACE2 and EGFR that promote viral entry into cells.

While causal evidence of microbial impacts on cancer biology is only beginning to be unraveled, enhanced molecular understanding of such cancer-modulating interactions and impacts on cancer treatment are considered of major scientific importance and clinical relevance. In this review, we describe the molecular pathogenic mechanisms shared throughout microbial niches that contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer.

Here, we showed that C57BL/6J wild-type mice intranasally inoculated with the murine betacoronavirus murine hepatitis coronavirus 3 (MHV-3) develop a robust inflammatory response leading to acute lung injuries, including alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and fibrin thrombi. Although such histopathological changes seemed to resolve as the infection advanced, they efficiently impaired respiratory function, as the infected mice displayed restricted lung distention and increased respiratory frequency and ventilation. Following respiratory manifestation, the MHV-3 infection became systemic, and a high virus burden could be detected in multiple organs along with morphological changes. The systemic manifestation of MHV-3 infection was also marked by a sharp drop in the number of circulating platelets and lymphocytes, besides the augmented concentration of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-12, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), thereby mirroring some clinical features observed in moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. Importantly, both respiratory and systemic changes triggered by MHV-3 infection were greatly prevented by blocking TNF signaling, either via genetic or pharmacologic approaches. In line with this, TNF blockage also diminished the infection-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines and virus replication of human epithelial lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Collectively, results show that MHV-3 respiratory infection leads to a large range of clinical manifestations in mice and may constitute an attractive, lower-cost, biosafety level 2 (BSL2) in vivo platform for evaluating the respiratory and multiorgan involvement of betacoronavirus infections.\nImportance\nMouse models have long been used as valuable in vivo platforms to investigate the pathogenesis of viral infections and effective countermeasures. The natural resistance of mice to the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has launched a race toward the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection in other animals (e.g., hamsters, cats, ferrets, bats, and monkeys), as well as adaptation of the mouse model, by modifying either the host or the virus. In the present study, we utilized a natural pathogen of mice, MHV, as a prototype to model betacoronavirus-induced acute lung injure and multiorgan involvement under biosafety level 2 conditions. We showed that C57BL/6J mice intranasally inoculated with MHV-3 develops severe disease, which includes acute lung damage and respiratory distress that precede systemic inflammation and death.

With the degradation of WTAP, the m6A levels of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and interferon alpha/beta receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) mRNAs are reduced, leading to translational suppression of IRF3 and instability of IFNAR1 mRNA. Thus, the WTAP-IRF3/IFNAR1 axis may serve as negative feedback pathway to fine-tune the activation of IFN-I signaling, which highlights the roles of m6A in the antiviral response by dictating the fate of mRNAs associated with IFN-I signaling.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630454400,"objectID":"ecd4b869dd2972eea947b3b38b51241d","permalink":"https://example.com/article/34467630/","publishdate":"2021-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/34467630/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a chemical modification present in multiple RNA species and is most abundant in mRNAs.

Progression of chronic liver disease by HCV infection is caused by a complex intercellular reaction. Especially, exosomes and microRNAs (miRNAs) from HCV-infected hepatocytes play a role in the pathogenesis of liver disease by facilitating cellular communication between parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells. However, the underlying mechanism of secretions of exosome and miRNAs during HCV infection is still open for study.\nApproach and results: In this study, we demonstrated a pathway for the release of exosome and exosomal miRNAs through caspase-3/pannexin 1 (Panx1)/P2X4 activation during HCV infection in hepatocytes. We found that HCV infection induced the stimulation of exosome release and activation of the caspase-3/Panx1/P2X4 pathway in Huh7.5.1 cells. In addition, miR-122 and miR-146a levels in extracellular exosomes from HCV-infected cells were dramatically increased whereas intracellular miR122 and miR-146a expression had no large changes. Notably, secretions of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs were decreased by inhibition of caspase 3, Panx1, and P2X4 whereas inhibition of ROCK-1 cleavage did not affect these during HCV infection in Huh7.5.1 cells.\nConclusions: These results suggested that HCV infection caused secretions of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs dependent on the caspase 3/Panx1/P2X4 pathway.

The pathogenesis of the disease remains largely unknown, leaving the spread of the disease uncontrolled in many countries and regions. Here, we identified E120R, a structural protein of ASFV, as a key virulence factor and late-phase-expressed protein of the virus. E120R revealed an activity to suppress the host antiviral response through blocking beta interferon (IFN-β) production, and the amino acids (aa) at sites 72 and 73 (amino acids 72-73) in the C-terminal domain were essential for this function. E120R interacted with interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and interfered with the recruitment of IRF3 to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which in turn suppressed IRF3 phosphorylation, decreasing interferon production. A recombinant mutant ASFV was further constructed to confirm the claimed mechanism. The ASFV lacking the complete E120R region could not be rescued, whereas the virus could tolerate the deletion of the 72nd and 73rd residues in E120R (ASFV E120R-Δ72-73aa). ASFV E120R with the two-amino-acid deletion failed to interact with IRF3 during ASFV E120R-Δ72-73aa infection, and the viral infection activated IRF3 phosphorylation highly and induced more robust type I interferon production than its parental ASFV. An unbiased transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression also confirmed that considerably more IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were detected in ASFV E120R-Δ72-73aa-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) than in wild-type ASFV-infected PAMs. Together, our findings have identified a novel mechanism evolved by ASFV to inhibit the host antiviral response, and they provide a new target for guiding the development of ASFV live-attenuated vaccine.\nImportance\nAfrican swine fever is a highly contagious animal disease affecting the pig industry worldwide, which has brought enormous economic losses. Infection by the causative agent, African swine fever virus (ASFV), causes severe immunosuppression during viral infection, contributing to serious clinical manifestations. Therefore, identification of the viral proteins involved in immunosuppression is critical for ASFV vaccine design and development. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated that E120R protein, a structural protein of ASFV, played an important role in suppression of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and type I interferon production by binding to IRF3 and blocking the recruitment of IRF3 to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1).

Many ciRNAs contain high GC% and tend to form DNA:RNA hybrids (R-loops) for RNase H1 cleavage, a process that appears to promote Pol II transcriptional elongation at ciRNA-producing loci. One ciRNA, ciankrd52, shows a stronger ability of R-loop formation than that of its cognate pre-mRNA by maintaining a locally open RNA structure in vitro. This allows the release of pre-mRNA from R-loops by ci-ankrd52 replacement and subsequent ciRNA removal via RNase H1 for efficient transcriptional elongation.

However, data on RA remission rates from multinational studies in the Asia-Pacific region are limited. We conducted a cross-sectional multicentric study to evaluate the clinical remission status and the related factors in RA patients in the Asia-Pacific region.\nMethods: RA patients receiving standard care were enrolled consecutively from 17 sites in 11 countries from APLAR RA SIG group. Data were collected on-site by rheumatologists with a standardized case-report form. Remission was analyzed by different definitions including disease activity score using 28 joints (DAS28) based on ESR and CRP, clinical disease activity index (CDAI), simplified disease activity index (SDAI), Boolean remission definition, and clinical deep remission (CliDR). Logistic regression was used to determine related factors of remission.\nFindings: A total of 2010 RA patients was included in the study, the overall remission rates were 62•3% (DAS28-CRP), 35•5% (DAS28-ESR), 30•8% (CDAI), 26•5% (SDAI), 24•7% (Boolean), and 17•1% (CliDR), respectively, and varied from countries to countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Biological and targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) prescription rate was low (17•9%). Compared to patients in non-remission, patients in remission had higher rates of b/tsDMARDs usage and lower rates of GC usage. The favorable related factors were male sex, younger age, fewer comorbidities, fewer extra-articular manifestations (EAM), and use of b/tsDMARDs, while treatment with GC was negatively related to remission.\nInterpretation: Remission rates were low and varied in the Asia-Pacific region. Treatment with b/tsDMARDs and less GC usage were related to higher remission rate.

PFMs summarize occurrences of each nucleotide at each position in a set of observed TF-DNA interactions. PFMs can be transformed to probabilistic or energistic models to construct position weight matrices (PWMs) or position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), which can be used to scan any DNA sequence to predict TF binding sites (TFBSs). The JASPAR database provides TFBSs predicted using the profiles in the CORE collection. The motifs in JASPAR are collected in two ways:\nInternally: de novo generated motifs, by analyzing ChIP-seq/-exo sequences using a custom motif discovery pipeline (check the code at our repository). Externally: motifs taken directly from other publications and/or resources. In both cases, the selected motifs are manually curated. Specifically, our curators assess the quality of the motif and search for an orthogonal publication providing support to the motif as the bona fide motif recognized by the TF of interest (e.g., a motif found in ChIP-seq peaks looks similar to one found by SELEX-seq). The Pubmed ID associated with the orthogonal support is provided in the TF profile metadata. JASPAR is the only database with this scope where the data can be used with no restrictions (open source).

Asthmatics were categorized by sputum differential cell count. The mRNA expressions were measured by RT-qPCR for sputum cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-27, FOXP3, IL-17A, and IL-5). The protein of IL-1β in sputum supernatant was detected by ELISA. Reticular basement membranes (RBM) were measured in the biopsy samples. The role and signaling pathways of IL-1β mediating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process were explored through A549 cells.\nResults:\nNA had increased baseline sputum cell IL-1β expression compared to eosinophilic asthmatics (EA). After follow-up, NA had less improvement in FEV1 compared to EA. For all asthmatics, sputum IL-1β mRNA was positively correlated with protein expression. Sputum IL-1β mRNA and protein levels were negatively correlated to FEV1 improvement. After subgrouping, the correlation between IL-1β mRNA and FEV1 improvement was significant in NA but not in EA. Thickness of RBM in asthmatics was greater than that of healthy controls and positively correlated with neutrophil percentage in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In vitro experiments, the process of IL-1β augmenting TGF-β1-induced EMT cannot be abrogated by glucocorticoid or montelukast sodium, but can be reversed by MAPK inhibitors.\nConclusions:\nIL-1β level in baseline sputum predicts the poor lung function improvement in NA.

N protein facilitates maturation of proinflammatory cytokines and induces proinflammatory responses in cultured cells and mice.

More importantly, N protein aggravates lung injury, accelerates death in sepsis and acute inflammation mouse models, and promotes IL-1β and IL-6 activation in mice. Notably, N-induced lung injury and cytokine production are blocked by MCC950 (a specific inhibitor of NLRP3) and Ac-YVAD-cmk (an inhibitor of caspase-1).

In multicellular organisms, newly formed autophagosomes undergo a process called ‘maturation’, in which they fuse with vesicles originating from endolysosomal compartments, including early/late endosomes and lysosomes, to form amphisomes, which eventually become degradative autolysosomes. This fusion process requires the concerted actions of multiple regulators of membrane dynamics, including SNAREs, tethering proteins and RAB GTPases, and also transport of autophagosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes towards each other. Multiple mechanisms modulate autophagosome maturation, including post-translational modification of key components, spatial distribution of phosphoinositide lipid species on membranes, RAB protein dynamics, and biogenesis and function of lysosomes. Nutrient status and various stresses integrate into the autophagosome maturation machinery to coordinate the progression of autophagic flux. Impaired autophagosome maturation is linked to the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer and myopathies. Furthermore, invading pathogens exploit various strategies to block autophagosome maturation, thus evading destruction and even subverting autophagic vacuoles (autophagosomes, amphisomes and autolysosomes) for survival, growth and/or release.

The intricate information cascade from transcriptome to metabolome was captured using multilayer neural networks to capitulate the nonlinear dependency between enzymatic gene expressions and reaction rates. We experimentally validated scFEA by generating an scRNA-seq data set with matched metabolomics data on cells of perturbed oxygen and genetic conditions. Application of scFEA on this data set showed the consistency between predicted flux and the observed variation of metabolite abundance in the matched metabolomics data. We also applied scFEA on five publicly available scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data sets and identified context- and cell group-specific metabolic variations. The cell-wise fluxome predicted by scFEA empowers a series of downstream analyses including identification of metabolic modules or cell groups that share common metabolic variations, sensitivity evaluation of enzymes with regards to their impact on the whole metabolic flux, and inference of cell-tissue and cell-cell metabolic communications.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1626912000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626912000,"objectID":"3137ebc74a8d768a87d17bb234beebf3","permalink":"https://example.com/article/34301623/","publishdate":"2021-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/34301623/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nThe metabolic heterogeneity and metabolic interplay between cells are known as significant contributors to disease treatment resistance.

Here, we demonstrate that MARCH8 profoundly inhibits influenza A virus (IAV) replication both in vitro and in mice. Mechanistically, MARCH8 suppresses IAV release through redirecting viral M2 protein from the plasma membrane to lysosomes for degradation. Specifically, MARCH8 catalyzes the K63-linked polyubiquitination of M2 at lysine residue 78 (K78). A recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus carrying the K78R M2 protein shows greater replication and more severe pathogenicity in cells and mice. More importantly, we found that the M2 protein of the H1N1 IAV has evolved to acquire non-lysine amino acids at positions 78/79 to resist MARCH8-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Together, our data support the important role of MARCH8 in host anti-IAV intrinsic immune defense by targeting M2, and suggest the inhibitory pressure of MARCH8 on H1N1 IAV transmission in the human population.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1626739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626739200,"objectID":"36e509d9c8d2f60801ce799ab845d83e","permalink":"https://example.com/article/34285233/","publishdate":"2021-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/34285233/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nThe membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) proteins are E3 ligases that regulate the stability of various cellular membrane proteins.

Iron metabolism-associated proteins such as ferritin are intricately regulated by cellular iron levels via the iron responsive element-iron regulatory protein (IRE-IRP) system.

Cellular iron loading caused a marked increase in CD63 expression and the secretion of CD63+ EVs from cells, which were shown to contain ferritin-H and ferritin-L. Our results demonstrate that under iron loading, intracellular ferritin is transferred via nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) to CD63+ EVs that are then secreted.

Cancer cells autonomously alter their flux through various metabolic pathways in order to meet the increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic demand as well as mitigate oxidative stress required for cancer cell proliferation and survival. Cancer driver mutations coupled with environmental nutrient availability control flux through these metabolic pathways. Metabolites, when aberrantly accumulated, can also promote tumorigenesis. The development and application of new technologies over the last few decades has not only revealed the heterogeneity and plasticity of tumours but also allowed us to uncover new metabolic pathways involved in supporting tumour growth. The tumour microenvironment (TME), which can be depleted of certain nutrients, forces cancer cells to adapt by inducing nutrient scavenging mechanisms to sustain cancer cell proliferation. There is growing appreciation that the metabolism of cell types other than cancer cells within the TME, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts and immune cells, can modulate tumour progression. Because metastases are a major cause of death of patients with cancer, efforts are underway to understand how metabolism is harnessed by metastatic cells. Additionally, there is a new interest in exploiting cancer genetic analysis for patient stratification and/or dietary interventions in combination with therapies that target metabolism.

Here, we have identified that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), a nuclear serine/threonine kinase, increases its expression in inflammatory macrophages. Importantly, HIPK2 deficiency or overexpression could enhance or inhibit inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated macrophages, respectively. HIPK2-deficient mice were more susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxemia and CLP-induced sepsis. Adoptive transfer of Hipk2+/- bone marrow cells (BMs) also aggravated AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer. Mechanistically, HIPK2 bound and phosphorylated histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) at serine 374 to inhibit its enzymatic activity, thus reducing the deacetylation of p65 at lysine 218 to suppress NF-κB activation. Notably, the HDAC3 inhibitors protected wild-type or Hipk2-/- BMs-reconstituted mice from LPS-induced endotoxemia.

It has affected a significant proportion of the global population both physically and mentally, and destroyed businesses and societies. Current evidence suggested that immunopathology may be responsible for COVID-19 pathogenesis, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, dysregulation of monocytes and macrophages, reduced or delayed type I interferon (IFN-I) response, antibody-dependent enhancement, and especially, cytokine storm (CS). The CS is characterized by hyperproduction of an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines and is closely associated with poor prognosis. These excessively secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines initiate different inflammatory signaling pathways via their receptors on immune and tissue cells, resulting in complicated medical symptoms including fever, capillary leak syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure, ultimately leading to death in the most severe cases. Therefore, it is clinically important to understand the initiation and signaling pathways of CS to develop more effective treatment strategies for COVID-19. Herein, we discuss the latest developments in the immunopathological characteristics of COVID-19 and focus on CS including the current research status of the different cytokines involved. We also discuss the induction, function, downstream signaling, and existing and potential interventions for targeting these cytokines or related signal pathways.

We applied Compass to associate metabolic states with T helper 17 (Th17) functional variability (pathogenic potential) and recovered a metabolic switch between glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, akin to known Th17/regulatory T cell (Treg) differences, which we validated by metabolic assays. Compass also predicted that Th17 pathogenicity was associated with arginine and downstream polyamine metabolism. Indeed, polyamine-related enzyme expression was enhanced in pathogenic Th17 and suppressed in Treg cells. Chemical and genetic perturbation of polyamine metabolism inhibited Th17 cytokines, promoted Foxp3 expression, and remodeled the transcriptome and epigenome of Th17 cells toward a Treg-like state.

Trafficking events across the nuclear pore are mediated by nuclear transport receptors and are highly regulated. The nuclear pore complex is also used by several RNA viruses and almost all DNA viruses to access the host cell nucleoplasm for replication. Viruses hijack the nuclear pore complex, and nuclear transport receptors, to access the nucleoplasm where they replicate. In addition, the nuclear pore complex is used by the cell innate immune system, a network of signal transduction pathways that coordinates the first response to foreign invaders, including viruses and other pathogens. Several branches of this response depend on dynamic signaling events that involve the nuclear translocation of downstream signal transducers. Mounting evidence has shown that these signaling cascades, especially those steps that involve nucleocytoplasmic trafficking events, are targeted by viruses so that they can evade the innate immune system.

Targeting ferroptosis is considered to be a novel anti-cancer strategy. The identification of FDA-approved drugs as ferroptosis inducers is proposed to be a new promising approach for cancer treatment. Despite a growing body of evidence indicating the potential efficacy of the anti-diabetic metformin as an anti-cancer agent, the exact mechanism underlying this efficacy has not yet been fully elucidated.\nMethods\nThe UFMylation of SLC7A11 is detected by immunoprecipitation and the expression of UFM1 and SLC7A11 in tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining. The level of ferroptosis is determined by the level of free iron, total/lipid Ros and GSH in the cells and the morphological changes of mitochondria are observed by transmission electron microscope. The mechanism in vivo was verified by in situ implantation tumor model in nude mice.\nResults\nMetformin induces ferroptosis in an AMPK-independent manner to suppress tumor growth. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that metformin increases the intracellular Fe2+ and lipid ROS levels. Specifically, metformin reduces the protein stability of SLC7A11, which is a critical ferroptosis regulator, by inhibiting its UFMylation process. Furthermore, metformin combined with sulfasalazine, the system xc− inhibitor, can work in a synergistic manner to induce ferroptosis and inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells.\nConclusions\nThis study is the first to demonstrate that the ability of metformin to induce ferroptosis may be a novel mechanism underlying its anti-cancer effect.

The results showed that exosomes containing circ_0008542 from MC3T3-E1 cells with prolonged tensile stimulation promoted osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Circ_0008542 upregulated Tnfrsf11a (RANK) gene expression by acting as a miR-185-5p sponge. Meanwhile, the circ_0008542 1916-1992 bp segment exhibited increased m6A methylation levels.

We describe the contributions of these recent technological advances to the characterization and phenotyping of EVs, examination of the role of EVs in cell-to-cell communication pathways and the identification and validation of EVs as disease biomarkers. Finally, we discuss the potential of innovative single-vesicle imaging and analysis methodologies using microfluidic devices, which promise to deliver rapid and effective basic and practical applications for minimally invasive prognosis systems.\n\u0026lt; Back to Reviews Alternative to Homepage ","date":1623801600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623801600,"objectID":"42114f39f2fa782e5113de1217e058c3","permalink":"https://example.com/review/34135505/","publishdate":"2021-06-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/review/34135505/","section":"review","summary":"Abstract\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous lipid containers with a complex molecular cargo comprising several populations with unique roles in biological processes.

In order to further improve SEP discovery, we implemented two effective and complementary polypeptide enrichment strategies using 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff filter and C8 solid-phase extraction column. These combined strategies enabled us to discover 353 SEPs from eight human cell lines and 409 SEPs from three mouse cell lines and eight mouse tissues. Importantly, 19 of them were then verified through in vitro expression, immunoblotting, parallel reaction monitoring, and synthetic peptides. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis revealed that some of the physical and chemical properties of these novel SEPs, including amino acid composition and codon usage, are different from those commonly found in canonical proteins. Intriguingly, nearly 65% of the identified SEPs were found to be initiated with non-AUG start codons. The 762 novel SEPs probably represent the largest number of SEPs detected by MS reported to date.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to major histocompability complex class Ι (MHC-Ι) down-regulation both in vitro and in vivo. The viral protein encoded by open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2, which shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all viral proteins, directly interacts with MHC-Ι molecules and mediates their down-regulation. In ORF8-expressing cells, MHC-Ι molecules are selectively targeted for lysosomal degradation via autophagy. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are much less sensitive to lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

However, the lack of detailed evaluation relevant to the potential cytotoxicity of these MSNs is still a major obstacle for their applications. Unlike the bare MSNs and amino- or liposome-modified MSNs, we found that polyethylenimine-modified MSNs (MSNs-PEI) had no obvious toxicity to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at the concentrations up to 100 μg/mL. However, MSNs-PEI induced autophagosomes accumulation by blocking their fusion with lysosomes, an essential mechanism for the cytotoxicity of many nanoparticles (NPs). Thus, we predicted that an alternative pathway for autophagosome clearance exists in HUVECs to relieve autophagic stress induced by MSNs-PEI. We found that MSNs-PEI prevented STX17 loading onto autophagosomes instead of influencing lysosomal pH or proteolytic activity. MSNs-PEI induced the structural alternation of the cytoskeleton but did not cause endoplasmic reticulum stress. The accumulated autophagosomes were released to the extracellular space via microvesicles (MVs) when the autophagic degradation was blocked by MSNs-PEI. More importantly, blockade of either autophagosome formation or release caused the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and excessive ROS production in the MSNs-PEI-treated HUVECs, which in turn led to cell death. Thus, we propose here that the MV-mediated autophagosome release, a compensation mechanism, allows the vascular endothelial cell survival when the degradation of autophagosomes is blocked by MSNs-PEI.

Here, we report mitocytosis, a migrasome-mediated mitochondrial quality-control process. We found that, upon exposure to mild mitochondrial stresses, damaged mitochondria are transported into migrasomes and subsequently disposed of from migrating cells. Mechanistically, mitocytosis requires positioning of damaged mitochondria at the cell periphery, which occurs because damaged mitochondria avoid binding to inward motor proteins. Functionally, mitocytosis plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial quality. Enhanced mitocytosis protects cells from mitochondrial stressor-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial respiration; conversely, blocking mitocytosis causes loss of MMP and mitochondrial respiration under normal conditions. Physiologically, we demonstrate that mitocytosis is required for maintaining MMP and viability in neutrophils in vivo.

We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for some of the positive PCR tests seen in patients. In support of this hypothesis, we found that DNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be integrated into the genome of infected human cells. We found target site duplications flanking the viral sequences and consensus LINE1 endonuclease recognition sequences at the integration sites, consistent with a LINE1 retrotransposon-mediated, target-primed reverse transcription and retroposition mechanism. We also found, in some patient-derived tissues, evidence suggesting that a large fraction of the viral sequences is transcribed from integrated DNA copies of viral sequences, generating viral-host chimeric transcripts. The integration and transcription of viral sequences may thus contribute to the detection of viral RNA by PCR in patients after infection and clinical recovery.

RNA in situ conformation sequencing (RIC-seq) is a technique for capturing protein-mediated RNA-RNA proximal interactions globally in living cells at single-base resolution. Cells are first treated with formaldehyde to fix all the protein-mediated RNA-RNA interactions in situ. After cell permeabilization and micrococcal nuclease digestion, the proximally interacting RNAs are 3’ end-labeled with pCp-biotin and subsequently ligated using T4 RNA ligase. The chimeric RNAs are then enriched and converted into libraries for paired-end sequencing. After deep sequencing, computational analysis yields interaction strength scores for every base on proximally interacting RNAs in the starting populations. The whole experimental procedure is designed to be completed within 6 d, followed by an additional 8 d for computational analysis. RIC-seq technology can unbiasedly detect intra- and intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions, thereby rendering it useful for reconstructing RNA higher-order structures and identifying direct noncoding RNA targets.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1621555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621555200,"objectID":"a1e5cc8dd50bda6023c9b161b324a292","permalink":"https://example.com/article/34021296/","publishdate":"2021-05-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/34021296/","section":"article","summary":"To learn more about the technique, following article published in Nature may teach you a lot:\nCai, Z. et al.

Herein, we demonstrate that the metabolite α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) induces pyroptosis through caspase-8-mediated cleavage of GSDMC. Treatment with DM-αKG, a cell-permeable derivative of α-KG, elevates ROS levels, which leads to oxidation of the plasma membrane-localized death receptor DR6. Oxidation of DR6 triggers its endocytosis, and then recruits both pro-caspase-8 and GSDMC to a DR6 receptosome through protein-protein interactions. The DR6 receptosome herein provides a platform for the cleavage of GSDMC by active caspase-8, thereby leading to pyroptosis. Moreover, this α-KG-induced pyroptosis could inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models. Interestingly, the efficiency of α-KG in inducing pyroptosis relies on an acidic environment in which α-KG is reduced by MDH1 and converted to L-2HG that further boosts ROS levels. Treatment with lactic acid, the end product of glycolysis, builds an improved acidic environment to facilitate more production of L-2HG, which makes the originally pyroptosis-resistant cancer cells more susceptible to α-KG-induced pyroptosis. This study not only illustrates a pyroptotic pathway linked with metabolites but also identifies an unreported principal axis extending from ROS-initiated DR6 endocytosis to caspase-8-mediated cleavage of GSDMC for potential clinical application in tumor therapy.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1621382400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621382400,"objectID":"6e6c9c2dbb835f99abd96604bcb01649","permalink":"https://example.com/article/34012073/","publishdate":"2021-05-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/34012073/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nPyroptosis is a form of regulated cell death mediated by gasdermin family members, among which the function of GSDMC has not been clearly described.

ATL2/3 directly interact with ULK1 and ATG13 and facilitate the ATG13-mediated recruitment/stabilization of ULK1 and ATG101. ATL2/3 also participate in forming ER-IM tethering complexes.

SFTSV was colocalized with macrophages in the spleen and liver, suggesting that the macrophages in the spleen and liver could be the principle target cells of SFTSV. In addition, histological analysis showed that the vascular endothelium integrity was severely disrupted upon viral infection along with depletion of platelets. In vitro cellular assays further revealed that SFTSV infection increased the vascular permeability of endothelial cells by promoting tyrosine phosphorylation and internalization of the adhesion molecule vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, a critical component of endothelial integrity. In addition, we found that both virus infection and pathogen-induced exuberant cytokine release dramatically contributed to the vascular endothelial injury.

Upon acute neonatal lung injury, AT1 cells reprogram into alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, promoting alveolar regeneration. In contrast, the ability of AT2 cells to regenerate AT1 cells is restricted to the mature lung.

In addition to forming disulfide bridges, cysteine residues are susceptible to oxidation by reactive oxygen species, and are thus central not only to the scavenging of these but also to cellular signalling and communication in biological as well as pathological contexts. Oxidized cysteine species are highly reactive and may form covalent conjugates with, for example, tyrosines in the active sites of some redox enzymes. However, to our knowledge, regulatory switches with covalent crosslinks other than disulfides have not previously been demonstrated. Here we report the discovery of a covalent crosslink between a cysteine and a lysine residue with a NOS bridge that serves as an allosteric redox switch in the transaldolase enzyme of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the pathogen that causes gonorrhoea. X-ray structure analysis of the protein in the oxidized and reduced state reveals a loaded-spring mechanism that involves a structural relaxation upon redox activation, which is propagated from the allosteric redox switch at the protein surface to the active site in the protein interior. This relaxation leads to a reconfiguration of key catalytic residues and elicits an increase in enzymatic activity of several orders of magnitude. The redox switch is highly conserved in related transaldolases from other members of the Neisseriaceae; for example, it is present in the transaldolase of Neisseria meningitides (a pathogen that is the primary cause of meningitis and septicaemia in children). We surveyed the Protein Data Bank and found that the NOS bridge exists in diverse protein families across all domains of life (including Homo sapiens) and that it is often located at catalytic or regulatory hotspots.

To develop a diagnostic evaluation index, the levels of exosomal miR-138-5p in samples from patients with breast cancer were compared to those of controls.\nResults: Coculture of breast cancer cells led to downregulation of KDM6B expression in macrophages.

Genetic depletion of iNOS specifically in macrophages (Cx3cr1-CreERT2;Nos2fl/fl or LysM-Cre;Nos2fl/fl) did not affect vascular architecture but highly compromised blood flow regulation in ischemic but not healthy muscle, which resulted in aggravated ischemic damage. Thus, the ability to upregulate blood flow was shifted from eNOS (endothelial)-dependence in healthy muscles to completely rely on macrophage-derived iNOS during ischemia. Macrophages in ischemic muscles expressed high levels of CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4) and CCR2 (C-C chemokine receptor type 2), and local overexpression by DNA plasmids encoding the corresponding chemokines CXCL12 (stromal-derived factor 1) or CCL2 (chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2) increased macrophage numbers, while CXCL12 but not CCL2 induced their perivascular positioning. As a result, CXCL12-overexpression increased the number of perfused blood vessels in the ischemic muscles, improved functional muscle perfusion in a macrophage-iNOS-dependent manner, and ultimately restored limb function.\nConclusions:\nThis study establishes a new function for macrophages during tissue repair, as they regulate blood flow through the release of iNOS-produced NO.

Recently, emerging evidence indicates that the ufmylation system is correlated with autophagy, although the exact mechanism remains largely unknown. To explore the regulation mechanism of DDRGK1 on autophagy, in this study, we established an immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines harvested from the DDRGK1F/F:ROSA26-CreERT2 mice, in which DDRGK1 depletion can be induced by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment. Here, we show that DDRGK1 deficiency in MEFs has a dual effect on autophagy, which leads to a significant accumulation of autophagosomes. On one hand, it promotes autophagy induction by impairing mTOR signaling; on the other hand, it blocks autophagy degradation by inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This dual effect of DDRGK1 depletion on autophagy ultimately aggravates apoptosis in MEFs. Further studies reveal that DDRGK1 loss is correlated with suppressed lysosomal function, including impaired Cathepsin D (CTSD) expression, aberrant lysosomal pH, and v-ATPase accumulation, which might be a potential trigger for impairment in autophagy process. Hence, this study confirms a crucial role of DDRGK1 as an autophagy regulator by controlling lysosomal function.

SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal samples, and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need.\nMethods: We enrolled 98 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity (3 asymptomatic, 53 mild, 34 moderate, 5 severe, 3 critical) and 78 non-COVID-19 controls matched for gender and co-morbidities. All subjects had fecal specimens sampled at inclusion. Blood specimens were collected for COVID-19 patients at admission to test for inflammatory markers and white cell counts. Among COVID-19 cases, 37 (38%) patients had serial fecal samples collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until after discharge. Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, we sequenced and profiled the fecal RNA and DNA virome. We investigated alterations and longitudinal dynamics of the gut virome in association with disease severity and blood parameters.\nResults: Patients with COVID-19 showed underrepresentation of Pepper mild mottle virus (RNA virus) and multiple bacteriophage lineages (DNA viruses) and enrichment of environment-derived eukaryotic DNA viruses in fecal samples, compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Such gut virome alterations persisted up to 30 days after disease resolution. Fecal virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection harbored more stress-, inflammation-, and virulence-associated gene encoding capacities including those pertaining to bacteriophage integration, DNA repair, and metabolism and virulence associated with their bacterial host. Baseline fecal abundance of 10 virus species (1 RNA virus, pepper chlorotic spot virus, and 9 DNA virus species) inversely correlated with disease COVID-19 severity. These viruses inversely correlated with blood levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, white cells, and neutrophils. Among the 10 COVID-19 severity-associated DNA virus species, 4 showed inverse correlation with age; 5 showed persistent lower abundance both during disease course and after disease resolution relative to non-COVID-19 subjects.\nConclusions: Both enteric RNA and DNA virome in COVID-19 patients were different from non-COVID-19 subjects, which persisted after disease resolution of COVID-19. Gut virome may calibrate host immunity and regulate severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observation that gut viruses inversely correlated with both severity of COVID-19 and host age may partly explain that older subjects are prone to severe and worse COVID-19 outcomes. Altogether, our data highlight the importance of human gut virome in severity and potentially therapeutics of COVID-19.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1618358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618358400,"objectID":"585ed1c745e3512ebc3c42e4e6a6bb42","permalink":"https://example.com/article/33853691/","publishdate":"2021-04-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/33853691/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the enveloped RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.

A defective epithelial barrier has been demonstrated in allergic and autoimmune conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, leakiness of the gut epithelium is also implicated in systemic autoimmune and metabolic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Finally, distant inflammatory responses due to a ’leaky gut’ and microbiome changes are suspected in Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, chronic depression and autism spectrum disorders.

Herpesviruses were the most abundant type of virus in the asthma group (44.6 ± 4.6%), mainly with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and EBV accounting for 24.5 ± 3.3% and 16.9 ± 3.5%, respectively, in contrast to those in the healthy controls (5.4 ± 2.5% and 7.1 ± 3.0%, respectively). CMV and EBV were more abundant in patients with asthma who experienced exacerbation, and their abundance showed correlation with more severe asthma, lower ACT score, and lower lung function.

The target sequences of a group of miRNAs overlap the canonical RRACH m6A motifs of these transcripts, many of which confer a survival advantage in glioblastoma. Ectopic expression of the RRACH-binding miR-145 induces loss of m6A, formation of FTO/AGO1/ILF3/miR-145 complexes on a clinically relevant tumor suppressor gene (CLIP3) and significant increase in its nascent translation.

Mechanistically, SRSF1 promotes the splicing of the long isoform of Bcl-x that interacts with Beclin1, thereby dissociating the Beclin1-PIK3C3 complex. In addition, SRSF1 also directly interacts with PIK3C3 to disrupt the interaction between Beclin1 and PIK3C3. Consequently, the decrease of SRSF1 stabilizes the Beclin1 and PIK3C3 complex and activates autophagy. Interestingly, SRSF1 can be degraded by starvation- and oxidative stresses-induced autophagy through interacting with LC3-II, whereas reduced SRSF1 further promotes autophagy. This positive feedback is critical to inhibiting Gefitinib-resistant cancer cell progression both in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, the expression level of SRSF1 is inversely correlated to LC3 level in clinical cancer samples.

However, the role of NLR family CARD domain containing 5 (NLRC5), an important member of PPRs, beyond host defense in angiogenesis during tissue repair remains unknown.\nMethods:\nIn vitro, western blot and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were used to detect the expression of NLRC5 in endothelial cells (ECs). Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to reveal the subcellular location of NLRC5 in ECs. Cell proliferation, wound healing, tube formation assays of ECs were performed to study the role of NLRC5 in angiogenesis. By using Tie2Cre-NLRC5flox/flox mice and bone marrow transplantation studies, we defined an EC-specific role for NLRC5 in angiogenesis. Mechanistically, co-immunoprecipitation studies and RNA sequencing indicated that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was the target of NLRC5 in the nucleus. And Co-IP was used to verify the specific domain of NLRC5 binding with STAT3.

Its dysregulation has devastating consequences, including cancer. The cell cycle is driven by precise regulation of proteins in time and space, which creates variability between individual proliferating cells. To our knowledge, no systematic investigations of such cell-to-cell proteomic variability exist. Here we present a comprehensive, spatiotemporal map of human proteomic heterogeneity by integrating proteomics at subcellular resolution with single-cell transcriptomics and precise temporal measurements of individual cells in the cell cycle. We show that around one-fifth of the human proteome displays cell-to-cell variability, identify hundreds of proteins with previously unknown associations with mitosis and the cell cycle, and provide evidence that several of these proteins have oncogenic functions. Our results show that cell cycle progression explains less than half of all cell-to-cell variability, and that most cycling proteins are regulated post-translationally, rather than by transcriptomic cycling. These proteins are disproportionately phosphorylated by kinases that regulate cell fate, whereas non-cycling proteins that vary between cells are more likely to be modified by kinases that regulate metabolism. This spatially resolved proteomic map of the cell cycle is integrated into the Human Protein Atlas and will serve as a resource for accelerating molecular studies of the human cell cycle and cell proliferation.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1614124800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614124800,"objectID":"50d7e6ff04f771030f1713bfa1f66e2c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/33627808/","publishdate":"2021-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/33627808/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nThe cell cycle, over which cells grow and divide, is a fundamental process of life.

Post-translational modifications on NLRC4 are critical for its activation. Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) is the most thoroughly studied mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) -dependent deacetylase. We wondered whether SIRT3 mediated-deacetylation could take part in NLRC4 inflammasome activation.\nMethods: We initially tested IL-1β production and pyroptosis after cytosolic transfection of flagellin or S. typhimurium infection in wild type and SIRT3-deficient primary peritoneal macrophages via immunoblotting and ELISA assay. These results were confirmed in SIRT3-deficient immortalized bone marrow derived macrophages (iBMDMs) which were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology. In addition, in vivo experiments were conducted to confirm the role of SIRT3 in S. typhimurium-induced cytokines production. Then NLRC4 assembly was analyzed by immune-fluorescence assay and ASC oligomerization assay. Immunoblotting, ELISA and flow cytometry were performed to clarify the role of SIRT3 in NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes activation. To further investigate the mechanism of SIRT3 in NLRC4 activation, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), we did immunoblot, cellular fractionation and in-vitro deacetylation assay. Finally, to clarify the acetylation sites of NLRC4, we performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and immunoblotting analysis.\nResults: SIRT3 deficiency led to significantly impaired NLRC4 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, SIRT3 promotes NLRC4 inflammasome assembly by inducing more ASC speck formation and ASC oligomerization. However, SIRT3 is dispensable for NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome activation. Moreover, SIRT3 interacts with and deacetylates NLRC4 to promote its activation. Finally, we proved that deacetylation of NLRC4 at Lys71 or Lys272 could promote its activation.\nConclusions: Our study reveals that SIRT3 mediated-deacetylation of NLRC4 is pivotal for NLRC4 activation and the acetylation switch of NLRC4 may aid the clearance of S. typhimurium infection.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1613347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613347200,"objectID":"3a82370853cb68b1055712108456db93","permalink":"https://example.com/article/33664876/","publishdate":"2021-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/33664876/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nSalmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) infection of macrophage induces NLRC4 inflammasome-mediated production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β.

Here, we show that heparin prevented caspase-11-dependent immune responses and lethality in sepsis independent of its anticoagulant properties. Heparin or a chemically modified form of heparin without anticoagulant function inhibited the alarmin HMGB1-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interaction and prevented the macrophage glycocalyx degradation by heparanase. These events blocked the cytosolic delivery of LPS in macrophages and the activation of caspase-11, a cytosolic LPS receptor that mediates lethality in sepsis.

Therefore, we hypothesized that myofibroblast glycolysis might have a non-cell autonomous effect through lactate regulating the pathogenic phenotype of alveolar macrophages.

The lactate inductions of the histone lactylation and profibrotic gene expression were mediated by p300, as evidenced by their diminished concentrations in p300-knockdown macrophages.

In the past decade, ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by excessive lipid peroxidation, has been implicated in the development and therapeutic responses of various types of tumours. Experimental reagents (such as erastin and RSL3), approved drugs (for example, sorafenib, sulfasalazine, statins and artemisinin), ionizing radiation and cytokines (such as IFNγ and TGFβ1) can induce ferroptosis and suppress tumour growth. However, ferroptotic damage can trigger inflammation-associated immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment, thus favouring tumour growth. The extent to which ferroptosis affects tumour biology is unclear, although several studies have found important correlations between mutations in cancer-relevant genes (for example, RAS and TP53), in genes encoding proteins involved in stress response pathways (such as NFE2L2 signalling, autophagy and hypoxia) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and responses to treatments that activate ferroptosis.

Numerous organ injuries and degenerative pathologies are driven by ferroptosis. Intriguingly, therapy-resistant cancer cells, particularly those in the mesenchymal state and prone to metastasis, are exquisitely vulnerable to ferroptosis. As such, pharmacological modulation of ferroptosis, via both its induction and its inhibition, holds great potential for the treatment of drug-resistant cancers, ischaemic organ injuries and other degenerative diseases linked to extensive lipid peroxidation.

A forward-genetic screen of randomly mutagenized mice linked NINJ1 to PMR. Ninj1-/- macrophages exhibited impaired PMR in response to diverse inducers of pyroptotic, necrotic and apoptotic cell death, and were unable to release numerous intracellular proteins including HMGB1 (a known DAMP) and LDH (a standard measure of PMR). Ninj1-/- macrophages died, but with a distinctive and persistent ballooned morphology, attributable to defective disintegration of bubble-like herniations. Ninj1-/- mice were more susceptible than wild-type mice to infection with Citrobacter rodentium, which suggests a role for PMR in anti-bacterial host defence. Mechanistically, NINJ1 used an evolutionarily conserved extracellular domain for oligomerization and subsequent PMR.

The described protocol has several advantages over conventional approaches, such as exposome monitoring at the personal level, decontamination steps to increase sensitivity and simultaneous capture and high-throughput profiling of biotic and abiotic exposures. The protocol takes ~18 h of bench time over 2-3 d to prepare samples for high-throughput profiling and up to a couple of weeks of instrumental time to analyze, depending on the number of samples.

Then, protein–protein interactions (PPI), correlation analysis, gene-ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were applied for the differentially expressed autophagy-related genes. Finally, RNA expression of top five differentially expressed autophagy-related genes was validated in blood samples from COPD patients and healthy controls by qRT-PCR.\nResults: A total of 40 differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (14 up-regulated genes and 26 down-regulated genes) were identified between 23 COPD patients and 9 healthy controls. The PPI results demonstrated that these autophagy-related genes interacted with each other. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed autophagy-related genes indicated several enriched terms related to autophagy and mitophagy.

We performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in a macrophage cell line to identify negative regulators of IFN-γ responses. We discovered an unexpected role of the ubiquitin-fold modifier (Ufm1) conjugation system (herein UFMylation) in inhibiting responses to IFN-γ and lipopolysaccharide. Enhanced IFN-γ activation in UFMylation-deficient cells resulted in increased transcriptional responses to IFN-γ in a manner dependent on endoplasmic reticulum stress responses involving Ern1 and Xbp1. Furthermore, UFMylation in myeloid cells is required for resistance to influenza infection in mice, indicating that this pathway modulates in vivo responses to infection.

Here, we demonstrate that high glucose represses AMPK signaling via MG53 (also called TRIM72) E3-ubiquitin-ligase-mediated AMPKα degradation and deactivation. Specifically, high-glucose-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals AKT to phosphorylate AMPKα at S485/491, which facilitates the recruitment of MG53 and the subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of AMPKα. In addition, high glucose deactivates AMPK by ROS-dependent suppression of phosphorylation of AMPKα at T172.

MPT, when induced by bile acids, calcium overload, or an adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) activator, triggers assembly of the pyroptosome comprised of Apaf-1 and caspase-4 with a stoichiometry ratio of 7:2. Unlike the direct cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) by caspase-4 upon LPS ligation, caspase-4 activated in the Apaf-1 pyroptosome proceeds to cleave caspase-3 and thereby GSDME to induce pyroptosis.

Since the description of ferroptosis as an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death in 2012, there has been mounting interest in the process and function of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis can occur through two major pathways, the extrinsic or transporter-dependent pathway and the intrinsic or enzyme-regulated pathway. Ferroptosis is caused by a redox imbalance between the production of oxidants and antioxidants, which is driven by the abnormal expression and activity of multiple redox-active enzymes that produce or detoxify free radicals and lipid oxidation products. Accordingly, ferroptosis is precisely regulated at multiple levels, including epigenetic, transcriptional, posttranscriptional and posttranslational layers. The transcription factor NFE2L2 plays a central role in upregulating anti-ferroptotic defense, whereas selective autophagy may promote ferroptotic death.

However, the underlying mechanisms for the regulation of CSC stemness are poorly understood. Recently, increasing evidence shows that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators for cancer cell function in various malignancies including breast cancer, but how lncRNAs regulate the function of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) remains to be determined. Herein, using lncRNA/mRNA microarray assays, a novel lncRNA (named lnc030) is identified, which is highly expressed in BCSCs in vitro and in vivo, as a pivotal regulator in maintaining BCSC stemness and promoting tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, lnc030 cooperates with poly(rC) binding protein 2(PCBP2) to stabilize squalene epoxidase (SQLE) mRNA, resulting in an increase of cholesterol synthesis. The increased cholesterol in turn actives PI3K/Akt signaling, which governs BCSC stemness. In summary, these findings demonstrate that a new, lnc030-based mechanism for regulating cholesterol synthesis and stemness properties of BCSCs. The lnc030-SQLE-cholesterol synthesis pathway may serve as an effective therapeutic target for BCSC elimination and breast cancer treatment.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1606694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606694400,"objectID":"34db44c47c8f4b54358ee7ab9149e093","permalink":"https://example.com/article/33511005/","publishdate":"2020-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/33511005/","section":"article","summary":"Erratum in:\nA Novel Long Non-Coding RNA lnc030 Maintains Breast Cancer Stem Cell Stemness by Stabilizing SQLE mRNA and Increasing Cholesterol Synthesis.\nAbstract\nCancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered the roots of cancer metastasis and recurrence (CSCs), due in part to their self-renewal and therapy resistance properties.","tags":["RNA","non-coding RNAs","Cancers","Obstetrics \u0026 Gynaecology","Breast","Signaling Pathway","PI3K/AKT"],"title":"A Novel Long Non-Coding RNA lnc030 Maintains Breast Cancer Stem Cell Stemness by Stabilizing SQLE mRNA and Increasing Cholesterol Synthesis","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nImmunometabolism has emerged as a key focus for immunologists, with metabolic change in immune cells becoming as important a determinant for specific immune effector responses as discrete signaling pathways.

We define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 out of 45 previously known cell types and 14 previously unknown ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas identifies the biochemical functions of lung cells and the transcription factors and markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signalling interactions and immune cell homing; and identifies cell types that are directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory viruses. By comparing human and mouse data, we identified 17 molecular cell types that have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others with substantially altered expression profiles, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell-type-specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types.

Transition of macrophages from a proinflammatory state to a reparative state, however, is vital for resolution of inflammation and return to homeostasis. The molecular players governing this transition remain poorly defined. Here, we find that the reparative macrophage transition is dictated by B-cell adapter for PI3K (BCAP). Mice harboring a macrophage-specific deletion of BCAP fail to recover from and succumb to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis due to prolonged intestinal inflammation and impaired tissue repair. Following microbial stimulation, gene expression in WT macrophages switches from an early inflammatory signature to a late reparative signature, a process that is hampered in BCAP-deficient macrophages. We find that absence of BCAP hinders inactivation of FOXO1 and GSK3β, which contributes to their enhanced inflammatory state. BCAP deficiency also results in defective aerobic glycolysis and reduced lactate production. This translates into reduced histone lactylation and decreased expression of reparative macrophage genes. Thus, our results reveal BCAP to be a critical cell-intrinsic switch that regulates transition of inflammatory macrophages to reparative macrophages by imprinting epigenetic changes.\nSignificance\nMacrophages initiate inflammation to eliminate invading microbes. Following clearance of inflammatory stimuli, macrophages down-regulate inflammatory genes and express repair genes to protect host tissues from damage. Here, we find that the adaptor B-cell adapter for PI3K (BCAP) facilitates this transition of inflammatory macrophages to reparative macrophages. Absence of BCAP in macrophages limits the ability of mice to repair intestinal tissues following inflammatory damage. Following Toll-like receptor stimulation, macrophages undergo aerobic glycolysis that results in lactate production, a process compromised in BCAP-deficient macrophages. This lactate is incorporated into histone tails and is involved in reparative macrophage transition. We find defective lactate production by BCAP-deficient macrophages results in reduced histone lactylation and expression of tissue repair genes, thus blunting their reparative transition.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1605484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605484800,"objectID":"d3c516d079e01aaa6b0b09e36fcacd0e","permalink":"https://example.com/article/33199625/","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/33199625/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nMacrophages respond to microbial ligands and various noxious cues by initiating an inflammatory response aimed at eliminating the original pathogenic insult.

Molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of hepatocyte apoptosis and their roles in hepatocarcinogenesis have attracted much attention. A set of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been determined to be dysregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and participated in cancer progression, however, the roles of these dysregulated miRNAs in carcinogenesis are still poorly understood. We previously analyzed the dysregulated miRNAs in HCC using high-throughput sequencing, and found that miR-199a/b-3p was abundantly expressed in human normal liver while markedly decreased in HCC, which promotes HCC progression. Whether miR-199a/b-3p participates in HCC carcinogenesis is still unknown up to now. Hence, we focused on the role and mechanism of miR-199a/b-3p in hepatocarcinogenesis in this study. Hepatic miR-199a/b-3p was determined to be expressed by miR-199a-2 gene in mice, and we constructed miR-199a-2 knockout and hepatocyte-specific miR-199a-2 knockout mice. Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis were markedly increased by hepatocyte-specific miR-199a-3p knockout, which is mediated by the enhanced hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic injury by DEN administration. In acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute hepatic injury model, hepatocyte-specific miR-199a-3p knockout also aggravated hepatic apoptosis. By proteomic screening and reporter gene validation, we identified and verified that hepatic programed cell death 4 (PDCD4), which promotes apoptosis, was directly targeted by miR-199a-3p. Furthermore, we confirmed that miR-199a-3p-suppressed hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic injury by targeting and suppressing PDCD4.

In the present study, we first demonstrated that TSPAN1 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer and that TSPAN1 depletion decreases pancreatic cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. TSPAN1 expression was correlated with poor overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Moreover, we demonstrated that TSPAN1 is a novel positive regulator of macroautophagy/autophagy characterized by decreased LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 expressions, inhibited puncta formation of GFP-LC3 and autophagic vacuoles. We also demonstrated that tspan1 mutation impaired autophagy in the zebrafish model. Furthermore, we showed that TSPAN1 promoted autophagy maturation via direct binding to LC3 by two conserved LIR motifs. Mutations in the LIR motifs of TSPAN1 resulted in a loss of the ability to induce autophagy and promote pancreatic cancer proliferation. Second, we discovered two conservative TCF/LEF binding elements present in the promoter region of the TSPAN1 gene, which was further verified through luciferase activity and ChIP assays. Furthermore, TSPAN1 was upregulated by FAM83A through the canonical WNT-CTNNB1 signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that both TSPAN1 and FAM83A are both direct targets of MIR454 (microRNA 454). Additionally, we revealed the role of MIR454-FAM83A-TSPAN1 in the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

IBV mainly causes human infections and has not been found to spread in poultry. The replication mechanism and the determinants of interspecies transmission of IBV are largely unknown. In this study, we found that the host ANP32 proteins are required for the function of the IBV polymerase. Human ANP32A/B strongly supports IBV replication, while ANP32E has a limited role. Unlike human ANP32A/B, chicken ANP32A has low support activity to IBV polymerase because of a unique 33-amino-acid insert, which, in contrast, exhibits species specific support to avian influenza A virus (IAV) replication. Chicken ANP32B and ANP32E have even lower activity compared with human ANP32B/E due to specific amino acid substitutions at sites 129-130. We further revealed that the sites 129-130 affect the binding ability of ANP32B/E to IBV polymerase, while the 33-amino-acid insert of chicken ANP32A reduces its binding stability and affinity. Taken together, the features of avian ANP32 proteins limited their abilities to support IBV polymerase, which could prevent efficient replication of IBV in chicken cells.

Here we report that the key T helper 17 (TH17) cell differentiation stimulator, STAT3, is subject to reversible S-palmitoylation on cysteine 108.

Some ncRNAs reportedly have important functions, including epigenetic regulation, chromatin remolding, protein modification, and RNA degradation, but the functions of most ncRNAs remain elusive. Through the application and development of ribosome profiling and sequencing technologies, an increasing number of studies have discovered the translation of ncRNAs. Although ncRNAs were initially defined as noncoding RNAs, a number of ncRNAs actually contain ORFs that are translated into peptides. Here, we summarize the available methods, tools, and databases for identifying and validating ncRNA-encoded peptides/proteins, and the recent findings regarding ncRNA-encoded small peptides/proteins in cancer are compiled and synthesized. Importantly, the role of ncRNA-encoding peptides/proteins has application prospects in cancer research, but some potential challenges remain unresolved. The aim of this review is to provide a theoretical basis that might promote the discovery of more peptides/proteins encoded by ncRNAs and aid the further development of novel diagnostic and prognostic cancer markers and therapeutic targets.\n\u0026lt; Back to Reviews Alternative to Homepage ","date":1602028800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602028800,"objectID":"dad1294e6958855b840b851f9eb5dbfc","permalink":"https://example.com/review/33038492/","publishdate":"2020-10-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/review/33038492/","section":"review","summary":"Highlights\nSome ncRNAs are translated into stable peptides or proteins, expanding the landscape of the proteome.\nSome tools, methods and databases are designed for identifying and validating ncRNA-encoded peptides related with cancer.","tags":["Cancers","RNA","non-coding RNAs","Circular RNAs","lncRNAs"],"title":"Translation of noncoding RNAs and cancer","type":"review"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nMacrophages are cells of the innate immune system that regulate the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, host defense during pathogen infection, and tissue repair in response to tissue injury.

The immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can contribute to the treatment of inflammatory disorders. In previous studies, the focus was on innate immune cells and the effects of MSCs on ALI through CD8+ T cells remain unclear. In the present study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce ALI in mice. ALI mice were treated with MSCs via intratracheal instillation. Survival rate, histopathological changes, protein levels, total cell count, cytokine levels, and chemokine levels in alveolar lavage fluid were used to determine the efficacy of MSCs. Mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were used to characterize the CD8+ T cells in the lungs. Ly6C- CD8+ T cells are prevalent in normal mice, whereas a specialized effector phenotype expressing a high level of Ly6C is predominant in advanced disease. MSCs significantly mitigated ALI and improved survival. MSCs decreased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, especially Ly6C+ CD8+ T cells into the lungs.

In this study, we compared the changes in lung B cells during MSC treatment.\nMethods: We investigated the effects of MSCs on lung B cells in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. MSCs were administered intratracheally 4 h after LPS. As vehicle-treated controls, mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% C57BL/6 (PBS group). Histopathological changes, survival rate, inflammatory factor levels, and the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis was performed to evaluate the transcriptional changes in lung B cells between the PBS, LPS, and LPS/MSC groups on days 3 and 7.\nResults: MSC treatment ameliorated LPS-induced ALI, as indicated by the reductions in mortality, the levels of chemokines and cytokines in BALF, and the severity of lung tissue histopathology in ALI mice. Lung B cells in the PBS group remained undifferentiated and had an inhibitory phenotype. Based on our scRNA-Seq results, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lung B cells in both the PBS group and LPS group were involved in chemotaxis processes and some proinflammatory pathways. MSC treatment inhibited the expression of chemokine genes that were upregulated by LPS and were related to the recruitment of neutrophils into lung tissues. Immunoglobulin-related gene expression was decreased in lung B cells of mice treated with LPS/MSC for 7 days. The DEGs regulated by MSCs were enriched in biological processes, including humoral immune response and apoptotic signaling.\nConclusions: Lung B cells played an important role in the effects of treatment of ALI with MSCs.

Mouse models have corroborated a role for FADD-caspase-8 in promoting inflammatory responses, but the mechanisms that underlie immunodeficiency remain undefined. Here we identify NEDD4-binding protein 1 (N4BP1) as a suppressor of cytokine production that is cleaved and inactivated by caspase-8. N4BP1 deletion in mice increased the production of select cytokines upon stimulation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)1-TLR2 heterodimer (referred to herein as TLR1/2), TLR7 or TLR9, but not upon engagement of TLR3 or TLR4. N4BP1 did not suppress TLR3 or TLR4 responses in wild-type macrophages, owing to TRIF- and caspase-8-dependent cleavage of N4BP1. Notably, the impaired production of cytokines in response to TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation of caspase-8-deficient macrophages was largely rescued by co-deletion of N4BP1. Thus, the persistence of intact N4BP1 in caspase-8-deficient macrophages impairs their ability to mount robust cytokine responses. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF), like TLR3 or TLR4 agonists, also induced caspase-8-dependent cleavage of N4BP1, thereby licensing TRIF-independent TLRs to produce higher levels of inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, our results identify N4BP1 as a potent suppressor of cytokine responses; reveal N4BP1 cleavage by caspase-8 as a point of signal integration during inflammation; and offer an explanation for immunodeficiency caused by mutations of FADD and caspase-8.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1600905600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600905600,"objectID":"f4568630417ed48e2197af10db5aad34","permalink":"https://example.com/article/32971525/","publishdate":"2020-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/32971525/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nMutations in the death receptor FAS or its ligand FASL cause autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, whereas mutations in caspase-8 or its adaptor FADD-which mediate cell death downstream of FAS and FASL-cause severe immunodeficiency in addition to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.","tags":["Immunology"],"title":"Integration of innate immune signalling by caspase-8 cleavage of N4BP1","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nThe colon is primarily responsible for absorbing fluids.

By functionally screening the lncRNAs in macrophages, here we identified lncRNA Malat1, abundant in the nucleus but significantly down-regulated after viral infection, as a negative regulator of antiviral type I IFN (IFN-I) production. Malat1 directly bound to the transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP43) in the nucleus and prevented activation of TDP43 by blocking the activated caspase-3-mediated TDP43 cleavage to TDP35. The cleaved TDP35 increased the nuclear IRF3 protein level by binding and degrading Rbck1 pre-mRNA to prevent IRF3 proteasomal degradation upon viral infection, thus selectively promoting antiviral IFN-I production. Deficiency of Malat1 enhanced antiviral innate responses in vivo, accompanying the increased IFN-I production and reduced viral burden. Importantly, the reduced MALAT1, augmented IRF3, and increased IFNA mRNA were found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Therefore, the down-regulation of MALAT1 in virus-infected cells or in human cells from autoimmune diseases will increase host resistance against viral infection or lead to autoinflammatory interferonopathies via the increased type I IFN production. Our results demonstrate that the nuclear Malat1 suppresses antiviral innate responses by targeting TDP43 activation via RNA-RBP interactive network, adding insight to the molecular regulation of innate responses and autoimmune pathogenesis.\nSignificance\nLncRNAs have been identified as regulating antiviral innate responses via different targets through various ways. Whether there is an abundant and highly conserved lncRNA in the nucleus which may regulate antiviral innate signaling through a new mechanism remains to be investigated. Here, we identify that viral infection-reduced expression of Malat1 feedback promotes IRF3-initiated type I IFN production in the innate response against viral infection. Malat1 binds to TDP43 and prevents its cleavage mediated by activated caspase-3. The cleaved TDP35 inhibits IRF3 degradation through promoting the degradation of pre-mRNA of Rbck1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting IRF3.

Importantly, these macrophages sensed, chemotaxed, and, with high efficiency, phagocytosed inhaled bacterial pathogens such as P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, cloaking the bacteria from neutrophils. Impairing AM chemotaxis toward bacteria induced superfluous neutrophil recruitment, leading to inappropriate inflammation and injury. In a disease context, influenza A virus infection impaired AM crawling via the type II interferon signaling pathway, and this greatly increased secondary bacterial co-infection.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1599091200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599091200,"objectID":"9d9bfa04dee40e85f82e6ab9a9b5a6e1","permalink":"https://example.com/article/32888431/","publishdate":"2020-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/32888431/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nDuring respiration, humans breathe in more than 10,000 liters of non-sterile air daily, allowing some pathogens access to alveoli.

Fifteen virus RT-PCR-positive samples were included as controls, while the other 76 samples were RT-PCR negative for a wide panel of respiratory pathogens. Eukaryotic viruses detected by mNGS were then screened by PCR (using primers based on mNGS-derived contigs) in all samples to compare viral detection by mNGS versus PCR and assess the utility of mNGS in routine diagnostics. mNGS identified expected human rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, influenza A virus, coronavirus OC43, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A in 13 of 15 (86.7%) positive control samples. Additionally, rotavirus, torque teno virus, human papillomavirus, human betaherpesvirus 7, cyclovirus, vientovirus, gemycircularvirus, and statovirus were identified through mNGS. Notably, complete genomes of novel cyclovirus, gemycircularvirus, and statovirus were genetically characterized. Using PCR screening, the novel cyclovirus was additionally detected in 5 and the novel gemycircularvirus in 12 of the remaining samples included for mNGS analysis. Our studies therefore provide pioneering data of the virome of acute-respiratory diseases from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections.

Recently, PIWI proteins, a subfamily of the PAZ-PIWI domain (PPD) protein family, have emerged as promising candidates for targeted cancer therapy. PPD proteins are essential for small noncoding RNA pathways. The Argonaute subfamily partners with microRNA and small interfering RNA, whereas the PIWI subfamily partners with PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA). Both PIWI proteins and piRNA are mostly expressed in the germline and best known for their function in transposon silencing, with no detectable function in mammalian somatic tissues. However, PIWI proteins become aberrantly expressed in multiple types of somatic cancers, thus gaining interest in targeted therapy. Despite this, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of PIWI proteins in cancer. Here we report that one of the four PIWI proteins in humans, PIWIL1, is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Knocking out the PIWIL1 gene (PIWIL1-KO) drastically reduces gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, metastasis, and tumorigenesis. RNA deep sequencing of gastric cancer cell line SNU-1 reveals that KO significantly changes the transcriptome, causing the up-regulation of most of its associated transcripts. Surprisingly, few bona fide piRNAs exist in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, abolishing the piRNA-binding activity of PIWIL1 does not affect its oncogenic function. Thus, PIWIL1 function in gastric cancer cells is independent of piRNA. This piRNA-independent regulation involves interaction with the UPF1-mediated nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) mechanism. Altogether, our findings reveal a piRNA-independent function of PIWIL1 in promoting gastric cancer.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1598400000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598400000,"objectID":"87e9c86cea1abea9a150d18870599604","permalink":"https://example.com/article/32848063/","publishdate":"2020-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/32848063/","section":"article","summary":"Erratum in:\nCorrection for Shi et al., PIWIL1 promotes gastric cancer via a piRNA-independent mechanism.\nAbstract\nTargeted cancer therapy aims to achieve specific elimination of cancerous but not normal cells.","tags":["Stomach","piRNA","Cancers","non-coding RNAs","RNA"],"title":"PIWIL1 promotes gastric cancer via a piRNA-independent mechanism","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nThe microenvironment in cancerous tissues is immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic, whereas the microenvironment of tissues affected by chronic inflammatory disease is pro-inflammatory and anti-resolution.

However, the inherent properties of Syntaxin17 and the mechanistic basis underlying the interactions of Syntaxin17 with its binding proteins remain largely unknown. Here, using biochemical, NMR, and structural approaches, we systemically characterized Syntaxin17 as well as its interactions with ATG8 family proteins, SNAP29 and VAMP8. We discovered that Syntaxin17 alone adopts an autoinhibited conformation mediated by a direct interaction between its Habc domain and the Qa-SNARE motif. In addition, we revealed that the Qa-SNARE region of Syntaxin17 contains one LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which preferentially binds to GABARAP subfamily members. Importantly, the GABARAP binding of Syntaxin17 can release its autoinhibited state. The determined crystal structure of the Syntaxin17 LIR-GABARAP complex not only provides mechanistic insights into the interaction between Syntaxin17 and GABARAP but also reveals an unconventional LIR motif with a C-terminally extended 310 helix for selectively binding to ATG8 family proteins. Finally, we also elucidated structural arrangements of the autophagic Syntaxin17-SNAP29-VAMP8 SNARE core complex, and uncovered its conserved biochemical and structural characteristics common to all other SNAREs.

Thus, the autophagic process participates in lipid catabolism that supports OxPHOS in AML cells. Interestingly, the inhibition of OxPHOS leads to LD accumulation with the concomitant inhibition of autophagy. Mechanistically, we show that the disruption of mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites (MERCs) phenocopies OxPHOS inhibition.

Importantly, we found that treating Trf-LKO mice with the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 potently rescued liver fibrosis induced by either high dietary iron or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) injections. In addition, deleting hepatic Slc39a14 expression in Trf-LKO mice significantly reduced hepatic iron accumulation, thereby reducing ferroptosis-mediated liver fibrosis induced by either a high-iron diet or CCl4 injections. Finally, we found that patients with liver cirrhosis have significantly lower levels of serum transferrin and hepatic transferrin, as well as higher levels of hepatic iron and lipid peroxidation, compared with healthy control subjects.

Reducing or ablating TRIM24 compromises type I IFN (IFN-I) induction upon RNA virus infection and thus renders mice more sensitive to VSV infection. Mechanistically, VSV infection induces abundant TRIM24 translocation to mitochondria, where TRIM24 binds with TRAF3 and directly mediates K63-linked TRAF3 ubiquitination at K429/K436. This modification of TRAF3 enables its association with MAVS and TBK1, which consequently activates downstream antiviral signaling. Together, these findings establish TRIM24 as a critical positive regulator in controlling the activation of antiviral signaling and describe a previously unknown mechanism of TRIM24 function.The predicted 80 open reading frames (ORFs) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) have been intensively studied for decades.

How IL-1β promotes liver injury in these diseases is unclear, as no IL-1β receptor-linked death pathway has been identified. Autophagy functions in hepatocyte resistance to injury and death, and findings of decreased hepatic autophagy in many liver diseases suggest a role for impaired autophagy in disease pathogenesis. Recent findings that autophagy blocks mouse liver injury from lipopolysaccharide led to an examination of autophagy’s function in hepatotoxicity from proinflammatory cytokines.\nApproach and results: AML12 cells with decreased autophagy from a lentiviral autophagy-related 5 (Atg5) knockdown were resistant to toxicity from TNF, but sensitized to death from IL-1β, which was markedly amplified by TNF co-treatment. IL-1β/TNF death was necrosis by trypan blue and propidium iodide positivity, absence of mitochondrial death pathway and caspase activation, and failure of a caspase inhibitor or necrostatin-1s to prevent death. IL-1β/TNF depleted autophagy-deficient cells of ATP, and ATP depletion and cell death were prevented by supplementation with the energy substrate pyruvate or oleate. Pharmacological inhibitors and genetic knockdown studies demonstrated that IL-1β/TNF-induced necrosis resulted from lysosomal permeabilization and release of cathepsins B and L in autophagy-deficient cells. Mice with a tamoxifen-inducible, hepatocyte-specific Atg5 knockout were similarly sensitized to cathepsin-dependent hepatocellular injury and death from IL-1β/TNF in combination, but neither IL-1β nor TNF alone. Knockout mice had increased hepatic inflammation, and IL-1β/TNF-treated, autophagy-deficient AML12 cells secreted exosomes with proinflammatory damage-associated molecular patterns.\nConclusions: The findings delineate mechanisms by which decreased hepatocyte autophagy promotes IL-1β/TNF-induced necrosis from impaired energy homeostasis and lysosomal permeabilization and inflammation through the secretion of exosomal damage-associated molecular patterns.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1592870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592870400,"objectID":"1c20ed53880cfeb90a9914ccef4565ce","permalink":"https://example.com/article/32108953/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/32108953/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground and aims: The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β has been implicated in the pathophysiology of nonalcoholic and alcoholic steatohepatitis.

We characterized an exosome population averaging 100 ± 50 nm in diameter and containing a defined set of constitutive exosome markers. This population packages microRNAs (miRNAs) and can be directed to block targeted gene expression in a dose-dependent fashion. The objective of this study was to characterize the role of hnRNPA2B1 in the recruitment of miRNA. We report the following four key findings. (i) hnRNPA2B1 is not a component of exosomes produced in HEp-2 or HEK293T cells. Hence, hnRNPA2B1 carries its cargo, at most, to the site of exosome assembly, but it is not itself incorporated into exosomes. (ii) The accumulation of exosomes produced by cells in which the gene encoding hnRNPA2B1 has been knocked out (ΔhnRNPA2B1 cells) was reduced 3-fold. (iii) In uninfected HEp-2 cells, hnRNPA2B1 is localized in the nucleus. In cells infected with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), hnRNPA2B1 was quantitatively exported to the cytoplasm and at least a fraction of hnRNPA2B1 colocalized with a Golgi marker. (iv) Lastly, in ΔhnRNPA2B1 cells, there was a 2- to 3-fold reduction in virus yield but a significant (\u0026gt;10-fold) reduction in HSV-1 released through the apical surface into the extracellular environment. The absence of hnRNPA2B1 had no significant impact on the basolateral export of HSV-1 from infected to uninfected cells by direct cell-to-cell contact.

Recent studies have suggested that breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an early biomarker of human cognitive dysfunction, including the early clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease. The E4 variant of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), the main susceptibility gene for Alzheimer’s disease, leads to accelerated breakdown of the BBB and degeneration of brain capillary pericytes, which maintain BBB integrity. It is unclear, however, whether the cerebrovascular effects of APOE4 contribute to cognitive impairment. Here we show that individuals bearing APOE4 (with the ε3/ε4 or ε4/ε4 alleles) are distinguished from those without APOE4 (ε3/ε3) by breakdown of the BBB in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. This finding is apparent in cognitively unimpaired APOE4 carriers and more severe in those with cognitive impairment, but is not related to amyloid-β or tau pathology measured in cerebrospinal fluid or by positron emission tomography23. High baseline levels of the BBB pericyte injury biomarker soluble PDGFRβ7,8 in the cerebrospinal fluid predicted future cognitive decline in APOE4 carriers but not in non-carriers, even after controlling for amyloid-β and tau status, and were correlated with increased activity of the BBB-degrading cyclophilin A-matrix metalloproteinase-9 pathway19 in cerebrospinal fluid.

The growing body of evidence, in conjunction with the identification of molecules controlling the concomitant activation of all three pathways by pathological triggers, has led to the development of the concept of PANoptosis. During PANoptosis, inflammatory cell death occurs through the collective activation of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, which can circumvent pathogen-mediated inhibition of individual death pathways. Many of the molecular details of this emerging pathway are unclear.

Infection of macrophages with influenza A virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, Listeria monocytogenes, or Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium resulted in robust cell death and the hallmarks of PANoptosis activation. Combined deletion of the PANoptotic components caspase-1 (CASP1), CASP11, receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), and CASP8 largely protected macrophages from cell death induced by these pathogens, while deletion of individual components provided reduced or no protection.

Modulating the activity and stability of cGAS provides potential strategies for treating viral or autoimmune diseases. Here, we report that ubiquitin-specific protease 29 (USP29) deubiquitinates and stabilizes cGAS and promotes cellular antiviral responses and autoimmunity. Knockdown or knockout of USP29 severely impairs Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)- or cytosolic DNA-induced expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. Consistently, Usp29m/m mice produce decreased type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines after HSV-1 infection and are hypersensitive to HSV-1 infection compared to the wild-type littermates. In addition, genetic ablation of USP29 in Trex1-/- mice eliminated the detectable pathological and molecular autoimmune phenotypes. Mechanistically, USP29 constitutively interacts with cGAS, deconjugates K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from cGAS and stabilizes cGAS in uninfected cells or after HSV-1 infection. Reconstitution of cGAS into Usp29-/- cells fully rescues type I IFN induction and cellular antiviral responses after HSV-1 infection.

We confirmed the protective role of PXR against kidney injury using genomic and pharmacologic approaches in an ischemia/reperfusion model of AKI. These findings demonstrate that disabling the PXR/AKR1B7/mitochondrial metabolism axis is an important factor that can contribute to AKI, whereas reestablishing this axis can be useful for treating AKI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1589328000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589328000,"objectID":"41629b810d8a78e0902e11d2483f0688","permalink":"https://example.com/article/32404507/","publishdate":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/32404507/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a worldwide public health problem with no specific and satisfactory therapies in clinic.

TASL contains a conserved pLxIS motif (in which p denotes a hydrophilic residue and x denotes any residue) that mediates the recruitment and activation of IRF5.

Some gut microbes exhibit differential features to lethal influenza infection depending on the infection outcome. Bifidobacterium pseudolongum and Bifidobacterium animalis levels are significantly elevated in surviving mice when compared to dead or mock-infected mice. Oral administration of B. animalis alone or the combination of both significantly reduces the severity of H7N9 infection in both antibiotic-treated and germ-free mice. Functional metagenomic analysis suggests that B. animalis mediates the anti-influenza effect via several specific metabolic molecules. In vivo tests confirm valine and coenzyme A produce an anti-influenza effect.\nConclusions: These findings show that the severity of influenza infection is closely related to the heterogeneous responses of the gut microbiota. We demonstrate the anti-influenza effect of B. animalis, and also find that the gut population of endogenous B. animalis can expand to enhance host influenza resistance when lethal influenza infection occurs, representing a novel interaction between host and gut microbiota.

Common mechanisms of evasion include impaired antigen presentation caused by mutations or loss of heterozygosity of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), which has been implicated in resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is resistant to most therapies including ICB, mutations that cause loss of MHC-I are rarely found despite the frequent downregulation of MHC-I expression. Here we show that, in PDAC, MHC-I molecules are selectively targeted for lysosomal degradation by an autophagy-dependent mechanism that involves the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1. PDAC cells display reduced expression of MHC-I at the cell surface and instead demonstrate predominant localization within autophagosomes and lysosomes. Notably, inhibition of autophagy restores surface levels of MHC-I and leads to improved antigen presentation, enhanced anti-tumour T cell responses and reduced tumour growth in syngeneic host mice. Accordingly, the anti-tumour effects of autophagy inhibition are reversed by depleting CD8+ T cells or reducing surface expression of MHC-I. Inhibition of autophagy, either genetically or pharmacologically with chloroquine, synergizes with dual ICB therapy (anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies), and leads to an enhanced anti-tumour immune response. Our findings demonstrate a role for enhanced autophagy or lysosome function in immune evasion by selective targeting of MHC-I molecules for degradation, and provide a rationale for the combination of autophagy inhibition and dual ICB therapy as a therapeutic strategy against PDAC.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1587513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587513600,"objectID":"4aff122c929d6fbc30eb003f18437f0c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/32376951/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/32376951/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nImmune evasion is a major obstacle for cancer treatment.

Gasdermins are pore-forming proteins that execute pyroptosis, a form of proinflammatory cell death. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is cleaved by caspase-1/4/5/11 upon inflammasome activation, releasing the pore-forming domain for plasma membrane disruption. Gasdermin E (GSDME) is similarly cleaved by caspase-3, converting apoptosis to pyroptosis. The functional mechanism for other gasdermins is unknown.\nRationale\nThe view that granzymes induce target-cell apoptosis was proposed two decades ago, when apoptosis was thought to be the dominant form of programmed cell death and assays to ascertain apoptosis were insufficiently accurate. Furthermore, granzyme cytotoxicity was only assessed in a few cell types. Discovery of the gasdermin family, which are true cell death executors, has altered our understanding of programmed cell death. In this work, we explored whether members of the gasdermin family might respond to granzymes and induce pyroptosis.\nResults\nThe expression of gasdermin B (GSDMB) but no other gasdermins in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells induced pyroptotic killing by NK cells, accompanied by an interdomain cleavage of GSDMB. These processes were blocked by inhibiting the perforin–granzyme pathway. In vitro profiling of all five human granzymes identified granzyme A (GZMA), which readily cleaved GSDMB, predominantly at Lys244 within the interdomain linker. This cleavage unmasked the pore-forming activity of GSDMB. GZMA, delivered into GSDMB-reconstituted cells by electroporation or perforin, induced extensive pyroptosis with interdomain cleavage of GSDMB. These effects were diminished by a K229A/K244A (KK/A) mutation of GSDMB. In cells normally undergoing apoptosis upon GZMA delivery, the additional expression of GZMA-cleavable GSDMB converted apoptosis into pyroptosis. Pyroptotic killing by NK cells was blocked by both the KK/AA mutation and a knockdown of GZMA expression. Among 39 cell lines, three, including the esophageal carcinoma (OE19 cells), expressed GSDMB and underwent pyroptosis upon GZMA delivery. Knockout experiments revealed that pyroptosis in OE19 cells required the interdomain cleavage of GSDMB. Furthermore, GSDMB expression was up-regulated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Approximately one-third of GSDMB-negative cell lines showed IFN-γ–induced GSDMB expression. IFN-γ promoted GZMA- or NK cell–induced pyroptosis in several target cells. Primary T cells, including anti-CD19 chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and NY-ESO-1–specific T cell receptor (TCR)–engineered T cells (TCR T cells), also induced pyroptosis in GSDMB-reconstituted cells through cleavage of GSDMB by GZMA. Introducing GZMA-cleavable GSDMB into mouse cancer cells promoted tumor clearance in mice. GSDMB was highly expressed in certain tissues, particularly digestive tract epithelia, including the derived tumors. GSDMB appeared to be silenced in gastric and esophageal cancers. The Cancer Genome Atlas database recorded a strong positive correlation between GSDMB expression and patient survival for bladder carcinoma and skin cutaneous melanoma.\nConclusion\nGZMA from cytotoxic lymphocytes cleaves and activates GSDMB to induce target cell pyroptosis. This immune effector mechanism promotes CTL-mediated tumor clearance in mice. High GSDMB expression in the digestive system suggests the importance of GSDMB-mediated immunity in these tissues and will guide immunotherapy for related cancers. Our findings suggest that substrates such as gasdermins, rather than their upstream proteases, determine the nature of cell death.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1586995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586995200,"objectID":"4aa070d5ff21b68e42430d34e6730289","permalink":"https://example.com/article/32299851/","publishdate":"2020-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/32299851/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nIntroduction\nIn cellular immunity, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells use perforin to deliver serine protease granzymes into target cells to kill them.

O-GlcNAcylation of IRF5 is required for K63-linked ubiquitination of IRF5 and subsequent cytokine production. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that IRF5 is O-GlcNAcylated, and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines correlated with higher levels of blood glucose in IAV-infected patients.

Here we report an updated algorithm of Group-based Prediction System (PGS) 5.0 to improve the performance for predicting kinase-specific phosphorylation sites (p-sites). Two novel methods, position weight determination (PWD) and scoring matrix optimization (SMO), were developed. Compared with other existing tools, GPS 5.0 exhibits a highly competitive accuracy. Besides serine/threonine or tyrosine kinases, GPS 5.0 also supports the prediction of dual-specificity kinase-specific p-sites. In the classical module of GPS 5.0, 617 individual predictors were constructed for predicting p-sites of 479 human PKs. To extend the application of GPS 5.0, a species-specific module was implemented to predict kinase-specific p-sites for 44,795 PKs in 161 eukaryotes.\nPhosphoNET is an open-access, online resource developed by Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation to foster the study of cell signalling systems to advance biomedical research in academia and industry. PhosphoNET is the worlds largest repository of known and predicted information on human phosphorylation sites, their evolutionary conservation, the identities of protein kinases that may target these sites and related phosphosites. PhosphoNET presently holds data on over 950,000 known and putative phosphorylation sites (P-sites) in over 20,000 human proteins that have been collected from the scientific literature and other reputable websites. Over 19% of these phosphosites have been experimentally validated. The rest have been predicted with a novel P-Site Predictor algorithm developed at Kinexus with academic partners at the University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University.\nWith the PhosphoNET Evolution module, this website also provides information about cognate proteins in over 20 other species that may share these human phosphosites. This helps to define the most functionally important phosphosites as these are expected to be highly conserved in nature. With the Kinase Predictor module, listings are provided for the top 50 human protein kinases that are likely to phosphorylate each of these phosphosites using another proprietary kinase substrate prediction algorithm developed at Kinexus. Our kinase substrate predictions are based on deduced consensus phosphorylation site amino acid frequency scoring matrices that we have determined for each of ~500 different human protein kinases. The specificity matrices are generated directly from the primary amino acid sequences of the catalytic domains of these kinases, and when available, have proven to correlate strongly with substrate prediction matrices based on alignment of known substrates of these kinases. The higher the score, the better the prospect that a kinase will phosphorylate a given site. Over 30 million kinase-substrate phosphosite pairs are quantified in PhosphoNET. Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation has the capability to test most of these putative interactions in vitro for our clients. With the Phosphosite Match module, we have identified those phosphosites that show the greatest amino acid identity to a selected target human phosphosite. This tool is useful to identify related phosphosites that might be targeted the same protein kinases, phosphatases and/or adapter proteins. This type of query might also help identify potential off-targets for cross-reactive proteins that are detected with phosphosite-specific antibodies that were generated to recognize target phosphosites. \u0026lt; Back to Databases Alternative to Tools ","date":1586649600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586649600,"objectID":"8b834511e72099ded122de03c7e48769","permalink":"https://example.com/tool/2020-04-12-pkspsp/","publishdate":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tool/2020-04-12-pkspsp/","section":"tool","summary":"In eukaryotes, protein phosphorylation is specifically catalyzed by numerous protein kinases (PKs), faithfully orchestrates various biological processes, and reversibly determines cellular dynamics and plasticity.

Mitochondrial malfunction needs to be relayed to the cytosol, where an integrated stress response is triggered by the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) in mammalian cells. eIF2α phosphorylation is mediated by the four eIF2α kinases GCN2, HRI, PERK and PKR, which are activated by diverse types of cellular stress. However, the machinery that communicates mitochondrial perturbation to the cytosol to trigger the integrated stress response remains unknown. Here we combine genome engineering and haploid genetics to unbiasedly identify genes that affect the induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a key factor in the integrated stress response. We show that the mitochondrial protease OMA1 and the poorly characterized protein DELE1, together with HRI, constitute the missing pathway that is triggered by mitochondrial stress. Mechanistically, stress-induced activation of OMA1 causes DELE1 to be cleaved into a short form that accumulates in the cytosol, where it binds to and activates HRI via its C-terminal portion. Obstruction of this pathway can be beneficial or adverse depending on the type of mitochondrial perturbation.

Several factors have been implicated in the cause of Crohn’s disease, including a dysregulated immune system, an altered microbiota, genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, but the cause of the disease remains unknown. The onset of the disease at a young age in most cases necessitates prompt but long-term treatment to prevent disease flares and disease progression with intestinal complications. Thus, earlier, more aggressive treatment with biologic therapies or novel small molecules could profoundly change the natural history of the disease and decrease complications and the need for hospitalization and surgery. Although less invasive biomarkers are in development, diagnosis still relies on endoscopy and histological assessment of biopsy specimens. Crohn’s disease is a complex disease, and treatment should be personalized to address the underlying pathogenetic mechanism.

Inhibition of the expression of type 1 IFNs and disruption of their receptor IFN-α/βR or downstream effector (eg, HMGB1) uniformly decreased gram-negative bacteria-induced DIC.

M. tuberculosis produces two classes of siderophore, lipid-bound mycobactin and water-soluble carboxymycobactin. Functional studies have revealed that iron-loaded carboxymycobactin is imported into the cytoplasm by the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter IrtAB, which features an additional cytoplasmic siderophore interaction domain. However, the predicted ABC exporter fold of IrtAB is seemingly contradictory to its import function. Here we show that membrane-reconstituted IrtAB is sufficient to import mycobactins, which are then reduced by the siderophore interaction domain to facilitate iron release. Structure determination by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy not only confirms that IrtAB has an ABC exporter fold, but also reveals structural peculiarities at the transmembrane region of IrtAB that result in a partially collapsed inward-facing substrate-binding cavity.

Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1; also known as DAI or DLM-1) is a nucleic acid sensor that contains two Zα domains that bind Z-DNA and Z-RNA. ZBP1 mediates host defence against some viruses by sensing viral nucleic acids. RIPK1 deficiency, or mutation of its RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM), triggers ZBP1-dependent necroptosis and inflammation in mice. However, the mechanisms that induce ZBP1 activation in the absence of viral infection remain unknown. Here we show that Zα-dependent sensing of endogenous ligands induces ZBP1-mediated perinatal lethality in mice expressing RIPK1 with mutated RHIM (Ripk1mR/mR), skin inflammation in mice with epidermis-specific RIPK1 deficiency (RIPK1E-KO) and colitis in mice with intestinal epithelial-specific FADD deficiency (FADDIEC-KO). Consistently, functional Zα domains were required for ZBP1-induced necroptosis in fibroblasts that were treated with caspase inhibitors or express RIPK1 with mutated RHIM. Inhibition of nuclear export triggered the Zα-dependent activation of RIPK3 in the nucleus resulting in cell death, which suggests that ZBP1 may recognize nuclear Z-form nucleic acids. We found that ZBP1 constitutively bound cellular double-stranded RNA in a Zα-dependent manner. Complementary reads derived from endogenous retroelements were detected in epidermal RNA, which suggests that double-stranded RNA derived from these retroelements may act as a Zα-domain ligand that triggers the activation of ZBP1. Collectively, our results provide evidence that the sensing of endogenous Z-form nucleic acids by ZBP1 triggers RIPK3-dependent necroptosis and inflammation, which could underlie the development of chronic inflammatory conditions-particularly in individuals with mutations in RIPK1 and CASP8.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1585094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585094400,"objectID":"dccced013681d99ff05e940dc8805ec7","permalink":"https://example.com/article/32296175/","publishdate":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/32296175/","section":"article","summary":"Erratum in:\nPublisher Correction: Z-nucleic-acid sensing triggers ZBP1-dependent necroptosis and inflammation.\nAbstract\nThe biological function of Z-DNA and Z-RNA, nucleic acid structures with a left-handed double helix, is poorly understood.","tags":["Immunology","Cell Death","Inflammation","Necroptosis"],"title":"Z-nucleic-acid sensing triggers ZBP1-dependent necroptosis and inflammation","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nChromatin dynamics regulated by epigenetic modification is crucial in genome stability and gene expression.

Recent studies have identified a gasdermin family of pore-forming proteins that executes inflammasome-dependent and -independent pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is proinflammatory, but its effect on antitumour immunity is unknown. Here we establish a bioorthogonal chemical system, in which a cancer-imaging probe phenylalanine trifluoroborate (Phe-BF3) that can enter cells desilylates and ‘cleaves’ a designed linker that contains a silyl ether. This system enabled the controlled release of a drug from an antibody-drug conjugate in mice. When combined with nanoparticle-mediated delivery, desilylation catalysed by Phe-BF3 could release a client protein-including an active gasdermin-from a nanoparticle conjugate, selectively into tumour cells in mice. We applied this bioorthogonal system to gasdermin, which revealed that pyroptosis of less than 15% of tumour cells was sufficient to clear the entire 4T1 mammary tumour graft. The tumour regression was absent in immune-deficient mice or upon T cell depletion, and was correlated with augmented antitumour immune responses. The injection of a reduced, ineffective dose of nanoparticle-conjugated gasdermin along with Phe-BF3 sensitized 4T1 tumours to anti-PD1 therapy. Our bioorthogonal system based on Phe-BF3 desilylation is therefore a powerful tool for chemical biology; our application of this system suggests that pyroptosis-induced inflammation triggers robust antitumour immunity and can synergize with checkpoint blockade.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1583884800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583884800,"objectID":"f4f9d51d4c0b83c49f967fc0ecec9498","permalink":"https://example.com/article/32188939/","publishdate":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/32188939/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBioorthogonal chemistry capable of operating in live animals is needed to investigate biological processes such as cell death and immunity.

However, the characterization of the meningeal lymphatic network has shed light on previously unappreciated ways that an immune response can be elicited to antigens that are expressed in the brain1-3. Despite progress in our understanding of the development and structure of the meningeal lymphatic system, the contribution of this network in evoking a protective antigen-specific immune response in the brain remains unclear. Here, using a mouse model of glioblastoma, we show that the meningeal lymphatic vasculature can be manipulated to mount better immune responses against brain tumours. The immunity that is mediated by CD8 T cells to the glioblastoma antigen is very limited when the tumour is confined to the central nervous system, resulting in uncontrolled tumour growth. However, ectopic expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) promotes enhanced priming of CD8 T cells in the draining deep cervical lymph nodes, migration of CD8 T cells into the tumour, rapid clearance of the glioblastoma and a long-lasting antitumour memory response. Furthermore, transfection of an mRNA construct that expresses VEGF-C works synergistically with checkpoint blockade therapy to eradicate existing glioblastoma. These results reveal the capacity of VEGF-C to promote immune surveillance of tumours, and suggest a new therapeutic approach to treat brain tumours.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1579046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579046400,"objectID":"08a6b97c2aa670dbc0fcf8118f39965c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/31942068/","publishdate":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/31942068/","section":"article","summary":"Erratum in:\nPublisher Correction: VEGF-C-driven lymphatic drainage enables immunosurveillance of brain tumours.\nAbstract\nImmune surveillance against pathogens and tumours in the central nervous system is thought to be limited owing to the lack of lymphatic drainage.","tags":["Nervous System","Brain","Cancers"],"title":"VEGF-C-driven lymphatic drainage enables immunosurveillance of brain tumours","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nGMrepo (data repository for Gut Microbiota) is a database of curated and consistently annotated human gut metagenomes.

Specifically, we find that the conserved acyl-CoA synthetase Faa1 accumulates on nucleated phagophores and locally activates fatty acids (FAs) required for phagophore elongation and autophagy. Strikingly, using isotopic FA tracing, we directly show that Faa1 channels activated FAs into the synthesis of phospholipids and promotes their assembly into autophagic membranes. Indeed, the first committed steps of de novo phospholipid synthesis at the ER, which forms stable contacts with nascent autophagosomes, are essential for autophagy.

Here, we examined the mechanisms underlying the activation of coagulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major cell-wall component of Gram-negative bacteria. We found that caspase-11, a cytosolic LPS receptor, activated the coagulation cascade. Caspase-11 enhanced the activation of tissue factor (TF), an initiator of coagulation, through triggering the formation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores and subsequent phosphatidylserine exposure, in a manner independent of cell death. GSDMD pores mediated calcium influx, which induced phosphatidylserine exposure through transmembrane protein 16F, a calcium-dependent phospholipid scramblase. Deletion of Casp11, ablation of Gsdmd, or neutralization of phosphatidylserine or TF prevented LPS-induced DIC. In septic patients, plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1β, biomarkers of GSDMD activation, correlated with phosphatidylserine exposure in peripheral leukocytes and DIC scores.

Abstract\nThe plasma membrane allows the cell to sense and adapt to changes in the extracellular environment by relaying external inputs via intracellular signaling networks. One central cellular signaling pathway is the Hippo pathway, which regulates homeostasis and plays chief roles in carcinogenesis and regenerative processes. Recent studies have found that mechanical stimuli and diffusible chemical components can regulate the Hippo pathway primarily through receptors embedded in the plasma membrane. Morphologically defined structures within the plasma membrane, such as cellular junctions, focal adhesions, primary cilia, caveolae, clathrin-coated pits, and plaques play additional key roles.

However, the pathological roles of lncRNAs in gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) remain largely unknown. Here we discovered a novel lncRNA termed lncRNA Highly expressed in GBC (lncRNA-HGBC) which was upregulated in GBC tissue and aimed to investigate its role and regulatory mechanism in the development and progression of GBC.\nMethods:\nThe expression level of lncRNA-HGBC in GBC tissue and different cell lines was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The full length of lncRNA-HGBC was obtained by 5’ and 3’ rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE). Cellular localization of lncRNA-HGBC was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays and subcellular fractionation assay. In vitro and in vivo assays were preformed to explore the biological effects of lncRNA-HGBC in GBC cells. RNA pull-down assay, mass spectrometry, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were used to identify lncRNA-HGBC-interacting proteins. Dual luciferase reporter assays, AGO2-RIP, and MS2-RIP assays were performed to verify the interaction between lncRNA-HGBC and miR-502-3p.\nResults:\nWe found that lncRNA-HGBC was upregulated in GBC and its upregulation could predict poor survival. Overexpression or knockdown of lncRNA-HGBC in GBC cell lines resulted in increased or decreased, respectively, cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and in xenografted tumors. LncRNA-HGBC specifically bound to RNA binding protein Hu Antigen R (HuR) that in turn stabilized lncRNA-HGBC. LncRNA-HGBC functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA to bind to miR-502-3p that inhibits target gene SET. Overexpression, knockdown or mutation of lncRNA-HGBC altered the inhibitory effects of miR-502-3p on SET expression and downstream activation of AKT. Clinically, lncRNA-HGBC expression was negatively correlated with miR-502-3p, but positively correlated with SET and HuR in GBC tissue.\nConclusions:\nOur study demonstrates that lncRNA-HGBC promotes GBC metastasis via activation of the miR-502-3p-SET-AKT cascade, pointing to lncRNA-HGBC as a new prognostic predictor and a therapeutic target.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1574294400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574294400,"objectID":"632f36d8ac373b8f2b6d224f6147f914","permalink":"https://example.com/article/31752906/","publishdate":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/31752906/","section":"article","summary":"Erratum in:\nCorrection to: LncRNA-HGBC stabilized by HuR promotes gallbladder cancer progression by regulating miR-502-3p/SET/AKT axis.\nAbstract\nBackgrounds:\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are essential factors that regulate tumor development and metastasis via diverse molecular mechanisms in a broad type of cancers.","tags":["Cancers","non-coding RNAs","RNA","Gall bladder","microRNAs","lncRNAs"],"title":"LncRNA-HGBC stabilized by HuR promotes gallbladder cancer progression by regulating miR-502-3p/SET/AKT axis","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nCaspase-8 is the initiator caspase of extrinsic apoptosis and inhibits necroptosis mediated by RIPK3 and MLKL.

Similar to Casp8−/− mice, Casp8C362S/C362S mouse embryos died after endothelial cell necroptosis leading to cardiovascular defects. MLKL deficiency rescued the cardiovascular phenotype but unexpectedly caused perinatal lethality in Casp8C362S/C362S mice, indicating that CASP8(C362S) causes necroptosis-independent death at later stages of embryonic development. Specific loss of the catalytic activity of caspase-8 in intestinal epithelial cells induced intestinal inflammation similar to intestinal epithelial cell-specific Casp8 knockout mice. Inhibition of necroptosis by additional deletion of Mlkl severely aggravated intestinal inflammation and caused premature lethality in Mlkl knockout mice with specific loss of caspase-8 catalytic activity in intestinal epithelial cells. Expression of CASP8(C362S) triggered the formation of ASC specks, activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1β.

Dopamine signaled through a specific dopamine receptor (DRD4) to promote T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation. The dopamine-DRD4 pathway acted synergistically with the cytokine IL-4 by upregulating IL-2-STAT5 signaling and reducing inhibitory histone trimethylation at Th2 gene loci. In murine models of allergen exposure, the dopamine-DRD4 pathway augmented Th2 inflammation in the lungs of young mice.

With the discovery of beneficial aspects of cellular senescence and evidence of senescence being not limited to replicative cellular states, a redefinition of our comprehension of aging and senescence appears scientifically overdue. Here, we provide a factor-based comparison of current knowledge on aging and senescence, which we converge on four suggested concepts, thereby implementing the newly emerging cellular and molecular aspects of geroconversion and amitosenescence, and the signatures of a genetic state termed genosenium.

Tumor budding (TB) is the presence of a single cancer cell or clusters of up to five cancer cells prior to the invasive front of an aggressive carcinoma and is an independent prognosis factor for CRC. The molecular mechanism of TB is still unclear, and drugs that inhibit this process are still in the blank stage. This study found that TBs exhibit characteristics of partial EMT with a decreased expression of E-cadherin and no substantial differences in the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin. We also observed the interaction of integrin with extracellular matrix components, laminin-5γ2 (LN-5γ2), play essential roles in the TB of CRC. We then verified that the interaction between LN-5γ2 and integrin β1 promotes the TB of CRC via the activation of FAK and Yes-associated proteins (YAP). A natural drug monomer, cucurbitacin B, was screened using virtual screening methods for the interaction interface of proteins. We found that this monomer could block the interaction interface between LN-5γ2 and integrin β1 and substantially inhibit the TB of CRC cells via inactivation of YAP.

This phenomenon is intimately linked to several diseases including neoplasia, sepsis and autoimmune diseases1,2. Lactate, which is converted from pyruvate in tumour cells, is widely known as an energy source and metabolic by-product. However, its non-metabolic functions in physiology and disease remain unknown. Here we show that lactate-derived lactylation of histone lysine residues serves as an epigenetic modification that directly stimulates gene transcription from chromatin. We identify 28 lactylation sites on core histones in human and mouse cells. Hypoxia and bacterial challenges induce the production of lactate by glycolysis, and this acts as a precursor that stimulates histone lactylation. Using M1 macrophages that have been exposed to bacteria as a model system, we show that histone lactylation has different temporal dynamics from acetylation. In the late phase of M1 macrophage polarization, increased histone lactylation induces homeostatic genes that are involved in wound healing, including Arg1. Collectively, our results suggest that an endogenous ‘lactate clock’ in bacterially challenged M1 macrophages turns on gene expression to promote homeostasis. Histone lactylation thus represents an opportunity to improve our understanding of the functions of lactate and its role in diverse pathophysiological conditions, including infection and cancer.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1571788800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571788800,"objectID":"41ac2eb56bafef8b198a68aa26e2c691","permalink":"https://example.com/article/31645732/","publishdate":"2019-10-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/31645732/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nThe Warburg effect, which originally described increased production of lactate in cancer, is associated with diverse cellular processes such as angiogenesis, hypoxia, polarization of macrophages and activation of T cells.","tags":["Metabolism","Lactylation"],"title":"Metabolic regulation of gene expression by histone lactylation","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nMuch attention has focused on commensal bacteria in health and disease, but the role of commensal viruses is understudied.

To date, ferroptosis has been thought to be controlled only by the phospholipid hydroperoxide-reducing enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and radical-trapping antioxidants. However, elucidation of the factors that underlie the sensitivity of a given cell type to ferroptosis is crucial to understand the pathophysiological role of ferroptosis and how it may be exploited for the treatment of cancer. Although metabolic constraints and phospholipid composition contribute to ferroptosis sensitivity, no cell-autonomous mechanisms have been identified that account for the resistance of cells to ferroptosis. Here we used an expression cloning approach to identify genes in human cancer cells that are able to complement the loss of GPX4. We found that the flavoprotein apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria-associated 2 (AIFM2) is a previously unrecognized anti-ferroptotic gene. AIFM2, which we renamed ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) and which was initially described as a pro-apoptotic gene, confers protection against ferroptosis elicited by GPX4 deletion. We further demonstrate that the suppression of ferroptosis by FSP1 is mediated by ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q10, CoQ10): the reduced form, ubiquinol, traps lipid peroxyl radicals that mediate lipid peroxidation, whereas FSP1 catalyses the regeneration of CoQ10 using NAD(P)H. Pharmacological targeting of FSP1 strongly synergizes with GPX4 inhibitors to trigger ferroptosis in a number of cancer entities. In conclusion, the FSP1-CoQ10-NAD(P)H pathway exists as a stand-alone parallel system, which co-operates with GPX4 and glutathione to suppress phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1571616000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571616000,"objectID":"c6e65cc55b03649768036047b410fa38","permalink":"https://example.com/article/31634899/","publishdate":"2019-10-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/31634899/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nFerroptosis is an iron-dependent form of necrotic cell death marked by oxidative damage to phospholipids.

The glutathione-dependent lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) prevents ferroptosis by converting lipid hydroperoxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. Ferroptosis has previously been implicated in the cell death that underlies several degenerative conditions, and induction of ferroptosis by the inhibition of GPX4 has emerged as a therapeutic strategy to trigger cancer cell death. However, sensitivity to GPX4 inhibitors varies greatly across cancer cell lines, which suggests that additional factors govern resistance to ferroptosis. Here, using a synthetic lethal CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identify ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) (previously known as apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondrial 2 (AIFM2)) as a potent ferroptosis-resistance factor. Our data indicate that myristoylation recruits FSP1 to the plasma membrane where it functions as an oxidoreductase that reduces coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) (also known as ubiquinone-10), which acts as a lipophilic radical-trapping antioxidant that halts the propagation of lipid peroxides. We further find that FSP1 expression positively correlates with ferroptosis resistance across hundreds of cancer cell lines, and that FSP1 mediates resistance to ferroptosis in lung cancer cells in culture and in mouse tumour xenografts. Thus, our data identify FSP1 as a key component of a non-mitochondrial CoQ antioxidant system that acts in parallel to the canonical glutathione-based GPX4 pathway. These findings define a ferroptosis suppression pathway and indicate that pharmacological inhibition of FSP1 may provide an effective strategy to sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic agents.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1571616000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571616000,"objectID":"756448dea987c0385a423077a8adf607","permalink":"https://example.com/article/31634900/","publishdate":"2019-10-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/31634900/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nFerroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that is caused by the iron-dependent peroxidation of lipids.

Strikingly, RPL26 UFMylation enables the degradation of stalled nascent chains, but unlike ERAD or previously established cytosolic ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), which uses proteasome to degrade their client proteins, ribosome UFMylation promotes the targeting of a translocation-arrested ER protein to lysosomes for degradation. RPL26 UFMylation is upregulated during erythroid differentiation to cope with increased secretory flow, and compromising UFMylation impairs protein secretion, and ultimately hemoglobin production.

ANXA11 possesses an N-terminal low complexity domain, facilitating its phase separation into membraneless RNA granules, and a C-terminal membrane binding domain, enabling interactions with lysosomes. RNA granule transport requires ANXA11, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated mutations in ANXA11 impair RNA granule transport by disrupting their interactions with lysosomes.

Here, using genome-scale CRISPR screens, we identify the actin histidine methyltransferase SET domain containing 3 (SETD3) as critically important for viral infection by a broad panel of EVs, including rhinoviruses and non-polio EVs increasingly linked to severe neurological disease such as acute flaccid myelitis (EV-D68) and viral encephalitis (EV-A71). We show that cytosolic SETD3, independent of its methylation activity, is required for the RNA replication step in the viral life cycle. Using quantitative affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we show that SETD3 specifically interacts with the viral 2A protease of multiple enteroviral species, and we map the residues in 2A that mediate this interaction. 2A mutants that retain protease activity but are unable to interact with SETD3 are severely compromised in RNA replication. These data suggest a role of the viral 2A protein in RNA replication beyond facilitating proteolytic cleavage. Finally, we show that SETD3 is essential for in vivo replication and pathogenesis in multiple mouse models for EV infection, including CV-A10, EV-A71 and EV-D68.

Stress granules are cytoplasmic compartments that enable cells to survive various stressors. Defects in the assembly and disassembly of stress granules are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, aberrant antiviral responses and cancer. Inflammasomes are multi-protein heteromeric complexes that sense molecular patterns that are associated with damage or intracellular pathogens, and assemble into cytosolic compartments known as ASC specks to facilitate the activation of caspase-1. Activation of inflammasomes induces the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 and drives cell fate towards pyroptosis—a form of programmed inflammatory cell death that has major roles in health and disease. Although both stress granules and inflammasomes can be triggered by the sensing of cellular stress, they drive contrasting cell-fate decisions. The crosstalk between stress granules and inflammasomes and how this informs cell fate has not been well-studied. Here we show that the induction of stress granules specifically inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation, ASC speck formation and pyroptosis. The stress granule protein DDX3X interacts with NLRP3 to drive inflammasome activation. Assembly of stress granules leads to the sequestration of DDX3X, and thereby the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Stress granules and the NLRP3 inflammasome compete for DDX3X molecules to coordinate the activation of innate responses and subsequent cell-fate decisions under stress conditions. Induction of stress granules or loss of DDX3X in the myeloid compartment leads to a decrease in the production of inflammasome-dependent cytokines in vivo. Our findings suggest that macrophages use the availability of DDX3X to interpret stress signals and choose between pro-survival stress granules and pyroptotic ASC specks.

Effective adaptation to such environmental insults is essential for the preservation of pulmonary function, whereas failure or incomplete adaptation to oxidative injury can render the host susceptible to the development of airway disease.\nObjective: We sought to explore the mechanisms of airway adaptation to oxidative injury.\nMethods: For a model to study pulmonary adaptation to oxidative stress-induced lung injury, we exposed mice to repeated nose-only chlorine gas exposures. Outcome measures were evaluated 24 hours after the last chlorine exposure. Lung mechanics and airway responsiveness to methacholine were assessed by using the flexiVent. Inflammation and antioxidant responses were assessed in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue. Using both loss or gain of function and genomic approaches, we further dissected the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in pulmonary adaptation.\nResults: Repeated exposures to oxidative stress resulted in pulmonary adaptation evidenced by abrogation of neutrophilic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. This adaptation was independent of antioxidant mechanisms and regulatory T cells but dependent on residential alveolar macrophages (AMs). Interestingly, 5% of AMs expressed forkhead box P3, and depletion of these cells abolished adaptation. Results from transcriptomic profiling and loss and gain of function suggest that adaptation might be dependent on TGF-β and prostaglandin E2.\nConclusion: Pulmonary adaptation during oxidative stress-induced lung injury is mediated by a novel subset of forkhead box P3-positive AMs that limits inflammation, favoring airway adaptation and host fitness through TGF-β and prostaglandin E2.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1564099200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564099200,"objectID":"ab6e6fc8dcaa71bcd6ed830f6eed631a","permalink":"https://example.com/article/31356919/","publishdate":"2019-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/31356919/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Inhaled oxidative toxicants present in ambient air cause airway epithelial injury, inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness.

We further show that recruited IDCs express the C-type lectin receptor SIGN-R1, which mediates direct recognition of the virus by interacting with N-linked glycans present in glycoproteins of the virion envelope. Activation of IDCs via SIGN-R1 triggers the production of the chemokines CCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10, which initiate the recruitment of protective natural killer (NK) cells in the infected trachea. In the absence of SIGN-R1, the recruitment and activation of NK cells is impaired, leading to uncontrolled viral proliferation.

Here, we develop a new method to assess how the genetic variation in viral populations contributes to this heterogeneity. We do this by determining the transcriptome and full-length sequences of all viral genes in single cells infected with a nominally “pure” stock of influenza virus. Most cells are infected by virions with defects, some of which increase the frequency of innate-immune activation. These immunostimulatory defects are diverse and include mutations that perturb the function of the viral polymerase protein PB1, large internal deletions in viral genes, and failure to express the virus’s interferon antagonist NS1. However, immune activation remains stochastic in cells infected by virions with these defects and occasionally is triggered even by virions that express unmutated copies of all genes. Our work shows that the diverse spectrum of defects in influenza virus populations contributes to-but does not completely explain-the heterogeneity in viral gene expression and immune activation in single infected cells.\nImportance\nBecause influenza virus has a high mutation rate, many cells are infected by mutated virions. But so far, it has been impossible to fully characterize the sequence of the virion infecting any given cell, since conventional techniques such as flow cytometry and single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) only detect if a protein or transcript is present, not its sequence. Here we develop a new approach that uses long-read PacBio sequencing to determine the sequences of virions infecting single cells.

Using loss/gain-of-function approaches to understand the role of S100a8/a9 in MI/R injury, we explored the mechanisms through transcriptome and functional experiment. Dynamic serum S100a8/a9 levels were measured in patients with acute myocardial infarction before and after percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were prospectively followed for the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events.\nResults: S100a8/a9 was identified as the most significantly upregulated gene during the early reperfusion stage. Knockout of S100a9 markedly decreased cardiomyocyte death and improved heart function, whereas hematopoietic overexpression of S100a9 exacerbated MI/R injury. Transcriptome/functional studies revealed that S100a8/a9 caused mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction in cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, S100a8/a9 downregulated NDUF gene expression with subsequent mitochondrial complex I inhibition via Toll-like receptor 4/Erk-mediated Pparg coactivator 1 alpha/nuclear respiratory factor 1 signaling suppression.

Chronic inflammation perpetuated by inflammasome activation plays a central role in all stages of tumorigenesis, including immunosuppression, proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. Conversely, inflammasome signalling also contributes to tumour suppression by maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, which portrays the diverse roles of inflammasomes in tumorigenesis.

The closely related human parasite, A. lumbricoides, infects more than 800 million people representing a disease burden of 1.31 million disability-adjusted life years. The infections are often chronic in nature, and the parasites have a profound ability to modulate their hosts’ immune responses. This study provides the first in-depth characterisation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from different developmental stages and body parts of A. suum and proposes the role of these vesicles in the host-parasite interplay. The release of EVs from the third- (L3) and fourth-stage (L4) larvae and adults was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and sequencing of EV-derived RNA identified a number of microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcripts of potential host immune targets, such as IL-13, IL-25 and IL-33, were identified. Furthermore, proteomics of EVs identified several proteins with immunomodulatory properties and other proteins previously shown to be associated with parasite EVs.

Wnt/β-catenin signaling mediates both heart and kidney injury in type 2 cardiorenal syndrome. Kidney Int. 2019;95:815-829.\nAbstract\nIn type 2 cardiorenal syndrome, chronic heart failure is thought to cause or promote chronic kidney disease; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the role of Wnt signaling in heart and kidney injury in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). At 8 weeks after TAC, cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis were prominent, and echocardiography confirmed impaired cardiac function. The cardiac lesions were accompanied by upregulation of multiple Wnt ligands and activation of β-catenin, as well as activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Wnt3a induced multiple components of the RAS in primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. TAC also caused proteinuria and kidney fibrosis, accompanied by klotho depletion and β-catenin activation in the kidney. Pharmacologic blockade of β-catenin with a small molecule inhibitor or the RAS with losartan ameliorated cardiac injury, restored heart function, and mitigated the renal lesions. Serum from TAC mice was sufficient to activate β-catenin and trigger tubular cell injury in vitro, indicating a role for circulating factors. Multiple inflammatory cytokines were upregulated in the circulation of TAC mice, and tumor necrosis factor-α was able to inhibit klotho, induce β-catenin activation, and cause tubular cell injury in vitro. These studies identify Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a common pathogenic mediator of heart and kidney injury in type 2 cardiorenal syndrome after TAC. Targeting this pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy to protect both organs in cardiorenal syndrome.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1549929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549929600,"objectID":"28abedecc5c3c0a19dcc10751ae794ba","permalink":"https://example.com/article/30770217/","publishdate":"2019-02-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/30770217/","section":"article","summary":"Erratum in:\nCorrigendum to Zhao Y, Wang C, Hong X, et al.

In vitro, infection with this engineered virus, named OV-CDH1, induced high surface E-cadherin expression on infected glioblastoma (GBM) cells, which typically lack endogenous E-cadherin. Ectopically expressed E-cadherin enhanced the spread of OV-CDH1 by facilitating cell-to-cell infection and viral entry and reduced viral clearance by selectively protecting OV-CDH1-infected cells from KLRG1+ NK cell killing. In vivo, OV-CDH1 treatment substantially prolonged the survival in GBM-bearing mouse models, primarily because of improved viral spread rather than inhibition of NK cell activity.

Unlike viruses with stereotyped shapes, influenza produces virions with significant morphological variability even within clonal populations. Whether this tendency to form pleiomorphic virions is coupled to compositional heterogeneity and whether it affects replicative fitness remains unclear. Here, we address these questions by developing a strain of influenza A virus amenable to rapid compositional characterization through quantitative, site-specific labeling of viral proteins. Using this strain, we find that influenza A produces virions with broad variations in size and composition from even single infected cells. This phenotypic variability contributes to virus survival during environmental challenges, including exposure to antivirals. Complementing genetic adaptations that act over larger populations and longer times, this “low-fidelity” assembly of influenza A virus allows small populations to survive environments that fluctuate over individual replication cycles.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1542585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542585600,"objectID":"04297e0f4427bda04f6410406a7fbc89","permalink":"https://example.com/article/30503209/","publishdate":"2018-11-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/30503209/","section":"article","summary":"Erratum in:\nCorrection 1: Low-Fidelity Assembly of Influenza A Virus Promotes Escape from Host Cells.\nCorrection 2: Low-Fidelity Assembly of Influenza A Virus Promotes Escape from Host Cells.\nAbstract","tags":["Virology","Influenza Virus","Microbiology","Microbial Infections","Interactome","Host-Pathogen Interactions","Immunology","Inflammation"],"title":"Low-Fidelity Assembly of Influenza A Virus Promotes Escape from Host Cells","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nIn animals, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) of 21-35 nucleotides in length silence transposable elements, regulate gene expression and fight viral infection. piRNAs guide PIWI proteins to cleave target RNA, promote heterochromatin assembly and methylate DNA.

Caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis mediates lethality in endotoxemia, but it is unclear how LPS is delivered into the cytosol for the activation of caspase-11. Here we discovered that hepatocyte-released high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was required for caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and lethality in endotoxemia and bacterial sepsis. Mechanistically, hepatocyte-released HMGB1 bound LPS and targeted its internalization into the lysosomes of macrophages and endothelial cells via the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). Subsequently, HMGB1 permeabilized the phospholipid bilayer in the acidic environment of lysosomes. This resulted in LPS leakage into the cytosol and caspase-11 activation. Depletion of hepatocyte HMGB1, inhibition of hepatocyte HMGB1 release, neutralizing extracellular HMGB1, or RAGE deficiency prevented caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and death in endotoxemia and bacterial sepsis.

As we enter this new era of mitochondrial medicine, underpinned by global unbiased approaches and multifaceted investigation of mitochondrial function, omics technologies will continue to shed light on unresolved mitochondrial questions, paving the way for improved outcomes for patients with mitochondrial diseases.\n\u0026lt; Back to Reviews Alternative to Homepage ","date":1529280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529280000,"objectID":"0e707596d7e49ec898e7b6385d11976c","permalink":"https://example.com/review/29903433/","publishdate":"2018-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/review/29903433/","section":"review","summary":"Abstract\nMitochondria are dynamic bioenergetic organelles whose maintenance requires around 1500 proteins from two genomes.

The recent finding that biallelic mutations in UBA5 (the E1-like enzyme for ufmylation) cause severe early-onset encephalopathy with progressive microcephaly implicates ufmylation in human brain development. More recently, a homozygous UFM1 variant was proposed as a candidate aetiology of severe early-onset encephalopathy with progressive microcephaly. Here, we establish a locus for severe early-onset encephalopathy with progressive microcephaly based on two families, and map the phenotype to a novel homozygous UFM1 mutation. This mutation has a significantly diminished capacity to form thioester intermediates with UBA5 and with UFC1 (the E2-like enzyme for ufmylation), with resulting impaired ufmylation of cellular proteins. Remarkably, in four additional families where eight children have severe early-onset encephalopathy with progressive microcephaly, we identified two biallelic UFC1 mutations, which impair UFM1-UFC1 intermediate formation with resulting widespread reduction of cellular ufmylation, a pattern similar to that observed with UFM1 mutation. The striking resemblance between UFM1- and UFC1-related clinical phenotype and biochemical derangements strongly argues for an essential role for ufmylation in human brain development. The hypomorphic nature of UFM1 and UFC1 mutations and the conspicuous depletion of biallelic null mutations in the components of this pathway in human genome databases suggest that it is necessary for embryonic survival, which is consistent with the embryonic lethal nature of knockout models for the orthologous genes.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1528761600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528761600,"objectID":"79fae797d61dcb58621f2da0963cbade","permalink":"https://example.com/article/29868776/","publishdate":"2018-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/29868776/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nThe post-translational modification of proteins through the addition of UFM1, also known as ufmylation, plays a critical developmental role as revealed by studies in animal models.

The long ncRNA Cyrano uses an extensively paired site to miR-7 to trigger destruction of this microRNA. Cyrano-directed miR-7 degradation is much more effective than previously described examples of target-directed microRNA degradation, which come primarily from studies of artificial and viral RNAs. By reducing miR-7 levels, Cyrano prevents repression of miR-7-targeted mRNAs and enables accumulation of Cdr1as, a circular RNA known to regulate neuronal activity. Without Cyrano, excess miR-7 causes cytoplasmic destruction of Cdr1as in neurons, in part through enhanced slicing of Cdr1as by a second miRNA, miR-671.

Microarray analysis revealed that SRC-3 not only regulates IL-17A but also IL-1R1 expression. SRC-3 bound to Il17a and Il1r1 loci in a RORγt-dependent manner and was required for recruitment of the p300 acetyltransferase.

The m6A modification is deposited by the m6A methyltransferase complex (MTC; i.e., writer) composed of METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP, and probably also VIRMA and RBM15, and can be removed by m6A demethylases (i.e., erasers) such as FTO and ALKBH5. The fates of m6A-modified mRNAs rely on the functions of distinct proteins that recognize them (i.e., readers), which may affect the stability, splicing, and/or translation of target mRNAs. Given the functional importance of the m6A modification machinery in normal bioprocesses, it is not surprising that evidence is emerging that dysregulation of m6A modification and the associated proteins also contributes to the initiation, progression, and drug response of cancers. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the study of biological functions and the underlying molecular mechanisms of dysregulated m6A modification and the associated machinery in the pathogenesis and drug response of various types of cancers.

This organ’s cellular complexity has hindered progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying chronic kidney disease, which affects 10% of the world’s population. Using single-cell transcriptional profiling, Park et al. produced a comprehensive cell atlas of the healthy mouse kidney (see the Perspective by Humphreys). An unexpected cell type in the collecting duct appears to be a transitional state between two known cell types. The transition from one cell type to the other is regulated by the Notch signaling pathway and is associated with metabolic acidosis. The authors also find that genetically distinct kidney diseases with common clinical features share common cellular origins.\nAbstract\nOur understanding of kidney disease pathogenesis is limited by an incomplete molecular characterization of the cell types responsible for the organ’s multiple homeostatic functions. To help fill this knowledge gap, we characterized 57,979 cells from healthy mouse kidneys by using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing. On the basis of gene expression patterns, we infer that inherited kidney diseases that arise from distinct genetic mutations but share the same phenotypic manifestation originate from the same differentiated cell type. We also found that the collecting duct in kidneys of adult mice generates a spectrum of cell types through a newly identified transitional cell. Computational cell trajectory analysis and in vivo lineage tracing revealed that intercalated cells and principal cells undergo transitions mediated by the Notch signaling pathway. In mouse and human kidney disease, these transitions were shifted toward a principal cell fate and were associated with metabolic acidosis.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1522886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522886400,"objectID":"72800bce1608dbcb103a9c33fc0084e7","permalink":"https://example.com/article/29622724/","publishdate":"2018-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/29622724/","section":"article","summary":"Touring the kidney, cell by cell\nOur kidneys play a critical role in keeping us healthy, a fact of which we are reminded several times each day.

About 80 potential interacting proteins are obtained from MS analyses of three biological replicates. Bioinformatics analyses of these proteins suggest that UFBP1 may participate in the regulation of protein folding, stability, and trafficking. Biochemical experiments discover that UFBP1 expression downregulates the protein level and reduces the stability of several of its interacting proteins, while UFBP1 knockdown increases their protein levels. Protein synthesis inhibition and proteasomal inhibition experiments reveal that UFBP1 promotes their ubiquitination and degradation. Experiments using a model UFBP1-interacting protein ANT3 demonstrate that UFBP1 enhances the interaction between ANT3 and its E3 ligase and thus promotes its ubiquitination and degradation.

The function of RNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) oxidized by ten-eleven translocation (Tet) proteins in Drosophila has been revealed more recently. However, the turnover and function of 5-mC in mammalian mRNA have been largely unknown. Tet2 suppresses myeloid malignancies mostly in an enzymatic activity-dependent manner, and is important in resolving inflammatory response in an enzymatic activity-independent way. Myelopoiesis is a common host immune response in acute and chronic infections; however, its epigenetic mechanism needs to be identified. Here we demonstrate that Tet2 promotes infection-induced myelopoiesis in an mRNA oxidation-dependent manner through Adar1-mediated repression of Socs3 expression at the post-transcription level. Tet2 promotes both abdominal sepsis-induced emergency myelopoiesis and parasite-induced mast cell expansion through decreasing mRNA levels of Socs3, a key negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway that is critical for cytokine-induced myelopoiesis. Tet2 represses Socs3 expression through Adar1, which binds and destabilizes Socs3 mRNA in a RNA editing-independent manner. For the underlying mechanism of Tet2 regulation at the mRNA level, Tet2 mediates oxidation of 5-mC in mRNA. Tet2 deficiency leads to the transcriptome-wide appearance of methylated cytosines, including ones in the 3’ untranslated region of Socs3, which influences double-stranded RNA formation for Adar1 binding, probably through cytosine methylation-specific readers, such as RNA helicases. Our study reveals a previously unknown regulatory role of Tet2 at the epitranscriptomic level, promoting myelopoiesis during infection in the mammalian system by decreasing 5-mCs in mRNAs. Moreover, the inhibitory function of cytosine methylation on double-stranded RNA formation and Adar1 binding in mRNA reveals its new physiological role in the mammalian system.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1516752000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516752000,"objectID":"4e7e4b5b7a70318046b99b6f710a4157","permalink":"https://example.com/article/29364877/","publishdate":"2018-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/29364877/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nVarieties of RNA modification form the epitranscriptome for post-transcriptional regulation. 5-Methylcytosine (5-mC) is a sparse RNA modification in messenger RNA (mRNA) under physiological conditions.

Electrical stimulation of vagus neurons or treatment with pulsed ultrasound activates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) and protects mice from acute kidney injury (AKI). Direct innervation of the kidney, by afferent and efferent neurons, might have a role in modulating and responding to inflammation in various diseases, either locally or by providing feedback to regions of the central nervous system that are important in the inflammatory reflex pathway. Increased sympathetic drive to the kidney has a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, and selective modulation of neuroimmune interactions in the kidney could potentially be more effective for lowering blood pressure and treating inflammatory kidney diseases than renal denervation.

To investigate such protein interactions, we establish a ribosome affinity purification method that unexpectedly identifies hundreds of ribosome-associated proteins (RAPs) from categories including metabolism and cell cycle, as well as RNA- and protein-modifying enzymes that functionally diversify mammalian ribosomes.

However, the mechanism underlying GP73 regulates HCV infection is largely unknown. Here, we revealed that GP73 acts as a novel negative regulator of host innate immunity to facilitate HCV infection. GP73 expression is activated and correlated with interferon-beta (IFN-β) production during HCV infection in patients’ serum, primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and human hepatoma cells through mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular regulated protein kinase (MEK/ERK) pathway. Detailed studies revealed that HCV infection activates MAVS that in turn recruits TRAF6 via TRAF-interacting-motifs (TIMs), and TRAF6 subsequently directly recruits GP73 to MAVS via coiled-coil domain. After binding with MAVS and TRAF6, GP73 promotes MAVS and TRAF6 degradation through proteasome-dependent pathway. Moreover, GP73 attenuates IFN-β promoter, IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) promoter and down-regulates IFN-β, IFN-λ1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56), leading to the repression of host innate immunity. Finally, knock-down of GP73 down-regulates HCV infection and replication in Huh7-MAVSR cells and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), but such repression is rescued by GP73m4 (a mutant GP73 resists to GP73-shRNA#4) in Huh7-MAVSR cells, suggesting that GP73 facilitates HCV infection. Taken together, we demonstrated that GP73 acts as a negative regulator of innate immunity to facilitate HCV infection by interacting with MAVS/TRAF6 and promoting MAVS/TRAF6 degradation. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of HCV infection and pathogenesis, and suggests that GP73 is a new potential antiviral target in the prevention and treatment of HCV associated diseases.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1491782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491782400,"objectID":"86f3c5ecb2e3d372f73c350714e7a43b","permalink":"https://example.com/article/28394926/","publishdate":"2017-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/28394926/","section":"article","summary":"Erratum in:\nCorrection: GP73 represses host innate immune response to promote virus replication by facilitating MAVS and TRAF6 degradation.\nAbstract\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Golgi protein 73 (GP73) is a serum biomarker for liver diseases and HCC.","tags":["Immunology","Microbial Infections","Virology","Interactome","Hepatitis Virus","Host-Pathogen Interactions","Microbiology","Inflammation"],"title":"GP73 represses host innate immune response to promote virus replication by facilitating MAVS and TRAF6 degradation","type":"article"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nCircular RNAs (circRNAs) constitute a family of transcripts with unique structures and still largely unknown functions.

Such projects are generating a wealth of information that potentially can guide research toward novel biomedical discoveries and advances in healthcare. To facilitate access to and learning from biomedical Big Data, we created the Harmonizome: a collection of information about genes and proteins from 112 datasets provided by 65 online resources.\nAbstract\nGenomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics efforts rapidly generate a plethora of data on the activity and levels of biomolecules within mammalian cells. At the same time, curation projects that organize knowledge from the biomedical literature into online databases are expanding. Hence, there is a wealth of information about genes, proteins and their associations, with an urgent need for data integration to achieve better knowledge extraction and data reuse. For this purpose, we developed the Harmonizome: a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins from over 70 major online resources. We extracted, abstracted and organized data into ∼72 million functional associations between genes/proteins and their attributes. Such attributes could be physical relationships with other biomolecules, expression in cell lines and tissues, genetic associations with knockout mouse or human phenotypes, or changes in expression after drug treatment. We stored these associations in a relational database along with rich metadata for the genes/proteins, their attributes and the original resources. The freely available Harmonizome web portal provides a graphical user interface, a web service and a mobile app for querying, browsing and downloading all of the collected data. To demonstrate the utility of the Harmonizome, we computed and visualized gene–gene and attribute–attribute similarity networks, and through unsupervised clustering, identified many unexpected relationships by combining pairs of datasets such as the association between kinase perturbations and disease signatures. We also applied supervised machine learning methods to predict novel substrates for kinases, endogenous ligands for G-protein coupled receptors, mouse phenotypes for knockout genes, and classified unannotated transmembrane proteins for likelihood of being ion channels.

Here, we describe a forward genetic screening paradigm exploiting CRISPR-mediated genome editing coupled to a cell selection step by FACS to identify regulators of SQSTM1. Through systematic comparison of pooled libraries, we show that CRISPR is superior to RNAi in identifying known SQSTM1 modulators. A genome-wide CRISPR screen exposed MTOR signalling and the entire macroautophagy machinery as key regulators of SQSTM1 and identified several novel modulators including HNRNPM, SLC39A14, SRRD, PGK1 and the ufmylation cascade. We show that ufmylation regulates SQSTM1 by eliciting a cell type-specific ER stress response which induces SQSTM1 expression and results in its accumulation in the cytosol. This study validates pooled CRISPR screening as a powerful method to map the repertoire of cellular pathways that regulate the fate of an individual target protein.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1467072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467072000,"objectID":"feb5468406496c95fb20a4f2f1e6f007","permalink":"https://example.com/article/27351204/","publishdate":"2016-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/27351204/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nSQSTM1 is an adaptor protein that integrates multiple cellular signaling pathways and whose expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational level.

We focus on the function of chromatin structure proteins cohesin as well as CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) in circadian rhythm. Using circular chromosome conformation capture sequencing, we systematically examined the interacting loci of a Bmal1-bound super-enhancer upstream of a clock gene Nr1d1 in mouse liver. These interactions are largely stable in the circadian cycle and cohesin binding sites are enriched in the interactome. Global analysis showed that cohesin-CTCF co-binding sites tend to insulate the phases of circadian oscillating genes while cohesin-non-CTCF sites are associated with high circadian rhythmicity of transcription. A model integrating the effects of cohesin and CTCF markedly improved the mechanistic understanding of circadian gene expression. Further experiments in cohesin knockout cells demonstrated that cohesin is required at least in part for driving the circadian gene expression by facilitating the enhancer-promoter looping.

However, these insults may trigger the downstream signaling of another prominent stress responsive pathway, the STAT3 signaling pathway, which has been implicated in multiple aspects of the autophagic process. Recent reports further indicate that different subcellular localization patterns of STAT3 affect autophagy in various ways. For example, nuclear STAT3 fine-tunes autophagy via the transcriptional regulation of several autophagy-related genes such as BCL2 family members, BECN1, PIK3C3, CTSB, CTSL, PIK3R1, HIF1A, BNIP3, and microRNAs with targets of autophagy modulators. Cytoplasmic STAT3 constitutively inhibits autophagy by sequestering EIF2AK2 as well as by interacting with other autophagy-related signaling molecules such as FOXO1 and FOXO3. Additionally, the mitochondrial translocation of STAT3 suppresses autophagy induced by oxidative stress and may effectively preserve mitochondria from being degraded by mitophagy. Understanding the role of STAT3 signaling in the regulation of autophagy may provide insight into the classic autophagy model and also into cancer therapy, especially for the emerging targeted therapy, because a series of targeted agents execute antitumor activities via blocking STAT3 signaling, which inevitably affects the autophagy pathway.

We identify the small molecule ferrostatin-1 as a potent inhibitor of ferroptosis in cancer cells and glutamate-induced cell death in organotypic rat brain slices, suggesting similarities between these two processes. Indeed, erastin, like glutamate, inhibits cystine uptake by the cystine/glutamate antiporter (system x(c)(-)), creating a void in the antioxidant defenses of the cell and ultimately leading to iron-dependent, oxidative death. Thus, activation of ferroptosis results in the nonapoptotic destruction of certain cancer cells, whereas inhibition of this process may protect organisms from neurodegeneration.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1337904000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1337904000,"objectID":"66ae8fadadcdb0be64a9e98da4112066","permalink":"https://example.com/article/22632970/","publishdate":"2012-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/22632970/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nNonapoptotic forms of cell death may facilitate the selective elimination of some tumor cells or be activated in specific pathological states.

It is designed for finding all the places in a reference genome where each sequence may come from. This task is essential to the analysis of data from ultra high-throughput sequencing machines. With a carefully designed index-filtering algorithm and an efficient implementation, SeqMap can map tens of millions of short sequences to a genome of several billions of nucleotides. Multiple substitutions and insertions/deletions of the nucleotide bases in the sequences can be tolerated and therefore detected. SeqMap supports FASTA input format and various output formats, and provides command line options for tuning almost every aspect of the mapping process. A typical mapping can be done in a few hours on a desktop PC.

For example, select commensal Escherichia coli strains produce the canonical microbiota-derived genotoxin colibactin, which engenders the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in intestinal epithelial cells and exacerbates CRC in mouse models. Furthermore, human CRCs harbor colibactin-associated mutational signatures, implying a direct role for microbiota-induced DNA damage in CRC. However, the impacts of microbiota-derived genotoxins beyond colibactin remain largely unexplored.\nRationale\nGiven the extensive diversity of small-molecule metabolites produced by bacteria, we hypothesized that additional taxa from the human gut microbiome might produce previously undiscovered small molecules that cause DNA damage in host cells. Identifying and characterizing such genotoxins and their respective biosynthetic pathways may reveal causal roles of gut microbes in shaping host biology and disease susceptibility. Thus, we designed a large-scale electrophoresis-based DNA damage screening pipeline to evaluate the genotoxicity of a collection of more than 100 gut commensals isolated from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\nResults\nWe identified diverse bacteria from the human microbiota whose small-molecule metabolites caused genotoxicity in both cell-free and cell-based DNA damage assays. For example, small-molecule metabolites from gram-positive bacteria (including Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium ramosum strains) and gram-negative bacteria (including multiple Morganella morganii strains) directly damaged DNA in cell-free assays and induced the expression of the DSB marker γ-H2AX and cell-cycle arrest in epithelial cells. However, the DNA damage patterns caused by these metabolites were distinct from colibactin-induced cross-links, and these isolates lacked the biosynthetic machinery to produce colibactin or other known genotoxins. These data thus implied the existence of previously unrecognized microbiota-derived genotoxins.\nM. morganii is enriched in the gut microbiota of both IBD and CRC patients. Using a combination of comparative metabolomics and bioactivity-guided natural product-discovery techniques, we discovered a family of M. morganii-derived small-molecule genotoxins—termed the indolimines—that elicited DNA damage in cell-based and cell-free assays. Furthermore, we identified a previously uncharacterized bacterial decarboxylase (annotated as an aspartate aminotransferase encoded by the aat gene) that was essential for indolimine synthesis and constructed an isogenic aat mutant M. morganii that lacked genotoxicity in both cell-free and cell-based DNA damage assays.\nCompared with the non–indolimine-producing mutant, wild-type M. morganii caused increased intestinal permeability and induced transcriptional signatures associated with abnormal DNA replication and intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in gnotobiotic mice. Furthermore, indolimine-producing M. morganii induced increased colonic tumor burden in the context of a mock microbial community in a mouse model of CRC.\nConclusion\nBy leveraging function-based assessments of the microbiome, we uncovered the existence of a broader universe of microbiota-derived small-molecule genotoxins. We found that diverse bacterial strains isolated from IBD patients exhibited DNA-damaging activities and discovered a previously undescribed family of genotoxins, termed the indolimines, produced by the IBD- and CRC-associated species M. morganii. Indolimine-producing M. morganii caused increased intestinal permeability and exacerbated colon tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic mice. Overall, these studies imply an expanded role for microbiota-derived genotoxins in shaping host biology and disease susceptibility.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1181779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1181779200,"objectID":"f518d1961a1620a601e1579b2dc9b43c","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36302024/","publishdate":"2007-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36302024/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nIntroduction\nGut microbiota can potentially contribute to the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) by producing small-molecule genotoxins.

Macrophages can be broadly classified into M1 ‘classical’ and M2 ‘alternatively-activated’ macrophages. M1 macrophages have been linked with inflammation-associated pathologies, whereas a switch towards an M2 phenotype indicates resolution of inflammation and tissue regeneration. Here, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the small RNA cargo of EVs from human M1 and M2 primary macrophages. Using small RNA sequencing, we identified several types of small non-coding RNAs in M1 and M2 macrophage EVs including miRNAs, isomiRs, tRNA fragments, piRNA, snRNA, snoRNA and Y-RNA fragments. Distinct differences were observed between M1 and M2 EVs, with higher relative abundance of miRNAs, and lower abundance of tRNA fragments in M1 compared to M2 EVs. MicroRNA-target enrichment analysis identified several gene targets involved in gene expression and inflammatory signalling pathways. EVs were also enriched in tRNA fragments, primarily originating from the 5’ end or the internal region of the full length tRNAs, many of which were differentially abundant in M1 and M2 EVs. Similarly, several other small non-coding RNAs, namely snRNAs, snoRNAs and Y-RNA fragments, were differentially enriched in M1 and M2 EVs; we discuss their putative roles in macrophage EVs.

We identified a novel hypoxia-responsive circRNA named circWSB1, whose expression pattern, potential diagnostic value and prognostic significance were assessed by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Loss- and gain-of-function investigations in vivo and in vitro were performed to determine the biological functions of circWSB1. Mechanistically, chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual luciferase reporter assays were carried out to analyze the biogenesis of circWSB1. Furthermore, biotin-labeled RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation, fluorescent in situ hybridization, RNA electrophoretic mobility shift, deletion-mapping, co-immunoprecipitation assays and rescue experiments were applied to investigate the interaction between circWSB1 and Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) as well as the relationship between USP10 and p53.\nResults: We found that the expression of circWSB1 was significantly upregulated in BC tissues and correlated with poor clinical outcomes, which might serve as an independent prognostic factor for BC patients. Ectopic expression of circWSB1 promoted the proliferation of BC cell in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circWSB1 was transcriptionally upregulated by HIF1α in response to hypoxia and could competitively bind to deubiquitinase USP10 to prevent the access of p53 to USP10 in BC cells, leading to degradation of p53 and tumor progression of BC.\nConclusions: Taken together, our findings disclose a novel mechanism that hypoxia-inducible circWSB1 could interact with USP10 to attenuate USP10 mediated p53 stabilization and promote the progression of BC, providing an alternative prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for BC.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1181779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1181779200,"objectID":"7af50f780c9f85223cbd6a2fcd626b5a","permalink":"https://example.com/article/35351136/","publishdate":"2007-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/35351136/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Hypoxia has long been considered as a hallmark of solid tumors and is closely associated with tumor progression.

Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of LF in AHR and the functions of dendritic cells (DCs) and Th2-related responses in asthma. Twenty 8-week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into normal control (NC), ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized, and OVA-sensitized with low dose of LF (100 mg/kg) or high dose of LF (300 mg/kg) treatment groups. The mice were challenged by intranasal instillation with 5% OVA on the 21st to 27th day after the start of the sensitization period. The AHR, cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and pulmonary histology of each mouse were measured. Serum OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 and OVA-specific splenocyte responses were further detected. The results showed that LF exhibited protective effects in ameliorating AHR, as well as lung inflammation and damage, in reducing the expression of Th2 cytokines and the secretion of allergen-specific antibodies, in influencing the functions of DCs, and in decreasing the level of Th2 immune responses in a BALB/c mouse model of OVA-induced allergic asthma. Importantly, we demonstrated that LF has practical application in reducing DC-induced Th2 cell responses in asthma.

When ALI mice were treated with MSCs, the mortality significantly reduced. Notably, MSCs reduced the amount of M1 macrophages and reduced the secretion of neutrophil chemokines on day 3. Furthermore, MSCs reduced the number of CD38+ mo-DCs and CD11b+CD38+ DCs on day 7, suppressing the antigen presentation process. Recruited mononuclear phagocyte subsets with a high level of CD38 exhibited an activated phenotype and could secrete higher levels of cytokines and chemokines.\nConclusions: This study characterized the dynamic functions and phenotypes of recruited mononuclear phagocytes in ALI mice and MSC-treated ALI mice.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1181779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1181779200,"objectID":"c6c44ca66bdf3ebd2d842a47dcd18266","permalink":"https://example.com/article/33500722/","publishdate":"2007-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/33500722/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nRationale: Acute lung injury (ALI)-recruited mononuclear phagocytes play a pivotal role in lung injury and repair.

Abstract\nBackground: Globally, Mechanical ventilation is the most commonly used short-term life support technology. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is an inflammatory injury caused by mechanical ventilation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as new gene regulators that play an important role in lung injury and inflammation. However, the role and mechanism of action of miR-9a-5p in VILI remain unclear.\nMethods: Herein, a rat model of VILI was established. To determine the expression levels of miR-9a-5p and CXCR4 mRNA, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were conducted. As well as western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence analyses, we determined the expression of CXCR4, SDF-1 and MAPK signaling pathway-related kinases. Hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026amp;E) staining and the wet-dry ratio of the lung tissue were used to evaluate organ injury. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity measurements were performed to evaluate the inflammatory response. In addition, double luciferase reporter assays were used to verify the association between miR-9a-5p and CXCR4.\nResults: The expression of miR-9a-5p was low, whereas that of CXCR4 was high in the lung tissues of VILI rats. The overexpression of miR-9a-5p alleviated the degree of pathological injury in the lung tissues of rats with VILI, downregulating inflammatory cytokine expression and MPO activity. In the VILI rat model, miR-9a-5p targeted the negative regulation of CXCR4, and CXCR4 overexpression to reverse the lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of miR-9a-5p overexpression in VILI rats. miR-9a-5p also inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal receptor-activated kinase (ERK), a protein related to the MAPK signaling pathway, by downregulating CXCR4 expression.\nConclusion: miR-9a-5p can hinder the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and reduce inflammatory reactions and lung injury in VILI rats through the targeted regulation of CXCR4 expression. Therefore, miR-9a-5p could serve as an intervention target to supply a new strategy for the care of VILI.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1181779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1181779200,"objectID":"93a219b8cd759d7fae5c9bcc17c4613e","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36193608/","publishdate":"2007-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36193608/","section":"article","summary":"Highlights\nI establishment of (ventilator-induced acute lung injury) VILI rat model.

Intravenous injection of HUMSCs can regulate the level of circulating endothelial cytokines and alleviate lung injury in juvenile septic rats. In this study, we performed proteomic and phosphorylated proteomic analysis of lung tissue of juvenile septic rats after Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (HUMSCs) intervention for the first time, and screened the potential proteins and pathways of HUMSCs for therapeutic effect. The 4D proteome quantitative technique was used to quantitatively analyze the lung tissues of septic rats 24 hours (3 biological samples) and 24 hours after HUMSCs intervention (3 biological samples). A total of 213 proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins, and 971 phosphorylation sites changed significantly. Based on the public database, we analyzed the functional enrichment of these proteins and phosphorylated proteins. In addition, Tenascin-C may be the key differential protein and ECM receptor interaction pathway may be the main signal pathway by using various algorithms to analyze the protein-protein interaction network. Phosphorylation analysis showed that tight junction pathway was closely related to immune inflammatory reaction, and EGFR interacted most, which may be the key differential phosphorylated protein. Finally, 123 conserved motifs of serine phosphorylation site (pS) and 17 conserved motifs of threonine (pT) phosphorylation sites were identified by motif analysis of phosphorylation sites.

Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)–a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":1181779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1181779200,"objectID":"1f3d0cccef2dca36adf414719ac082d7","permalink":"https://example.com/article/17568748/","publishdate":"2007-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/17568748/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nTherapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer.

Mechanistically, the UL21 protein scaffolds the E3 ligase UBE3C (ubiquitin protein ligase E3C) to catalyze the K27-linked ubiquitination of CGAS at Lys384, which is recognized by the cargo receptor TOLLIP (toll interacting protein) and degraded in the lysosome.

Moreover, viral tegument protein UL21 in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) also displays the conserved inhibitory mechanisms. Furthermore, by using PRV, we demonstrate the roles of UL21 in degrading CGAS to promote viral infection in vivo.

Whether or not the hypertensive phenotype can be transgenerationally transmitted is not known.\nMethods: Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gestation days 6, 8, 10, and 12 to generate the prenatal LPS exposure model. Blood pressure was monitored by both telemetry and tail-cuff method. RNA sequencing was performed to analyze transcriptome alteration in the kidney of the third generation. Tempol and spironolactone were used to test the potential preventative and therapeutic effect of targeting reactive oxygen species and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling, respectively. Molecular biological experiments were performed to illustrate the mechanism of epigenetic and transcription regulation.\nResults: Prenatal LPS exposure can impair the ability to excrete a salt load and induce hypertension from the first to the third generations, with the fourth and fifth generations, inducing salt-sensitive hypertension. Compared with control pups, the transcriptome in the kidney of the hypertensive third-generation prenatal LPS-exposed offspring have upregulation of the Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) gene and activation of mineralocorticoid receptor signaling. Furthermore, we found that LPS exposure during pregnancy triggered oxidative stress that upregulated KDM3B (histone lysine demethylase 3B) in the oocytes of first-generation female rats, leading to an inheritable low level of H3K9me2 (histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation), resulting in the transgenerational upregulation of Rac1. Based on these findings, we treated the LPS-exposed pregnant rats with the reactive oxygen species scavenger, tempol, which successfully prevented hypertension in the first-generation offspring and the transgenerational inheritance of hypertension.\nConclusions: These findings show that adverse prenatal exposure induces transgenerational hypertension through an epigenetic-regulated mechanism and identify potentially preventive and therapeutic strategies for hypertension.\n\u0026lt; Back to Articles Alternative to Homepage ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d24e858154da4d5ed7f55012d777d4c1","permalink":"https://example.com/article/36004643/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/article/36004643/","section":"article","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Adverse environmental exposure during the prenatal period can lead to diseases in the offspring, including hypertension.
