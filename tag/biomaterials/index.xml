      <title>Self-Assembly of Antimicrobial Peptide-Based Micelles Breaks the Limitation of Trypsin</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting the limitation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) application in vivo, self-assembled AMPs library with specific nanostructures is expected to gradually overtake monomer AMPs libraries in the future. Peptide polymers are fascinating self-assembling nanoscale structures that have great advantage in biomedical applications because of their satisfactory biocompatibility and versatile properties. Herein, we describe a strategy for inducing the self-assembly of T9W into nanostructured antimicrobial micelles with evidently improved pharmacological properties, that is, PEGylation at the C-terminal of T9W (CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt;), an antibacterial biomaterial that self-assembles in aqueous media without exogenous excipients, has been developed. Compared with parental molecular, the CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; is more effective against &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, and its antibacterial spectrum had also been broadened. Additionally, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles had higher stability under salt ion, serum, and acid-base environments. Importantly, the self-assembled structure is highly resistant to trypsin degradation, probably allowing T9W to be applied in clinical settings in the future. Mechanistically, by acting on membranes and through supplementary bactericidal mechanisms, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles contribute to the antibacterial process. Collectively, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles exhibited good biocompatibility &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, resulting in highly effective treatment in a mouse acute lung injury model induced by &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 without drug resistance. These advances may profoundly accelerate the clinical transformation of T9W and promote the development of a combination of peptide-based antibiotics and PEGylated nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane- N, N, N&#39;, N&#39;-tetraacetic Acid Acetoxymethyl Ester Loaded Reactive Oxygen Species Responsive Hyaluronic Acid-Bilirubin Nanoparticles for Acute Kidney Injury Therapy via Alleviating Calcium Overload Mediated Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36574627/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcium overload is one of the early determinants of the core cellular events that contribute to the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI), which include oxidative stress, ATP depletion, calcium overload, and inflammatory response with self-amplifying and interactive feedback loops that ultimately lead to cellular injury and renal failure. Excluding adjuvant therapy, there are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AKI. Using an adipic dihydride linker, we modified the hyaluronic acid polymer chain with a potent antioxidant, bilirubin, to produce an amphiphilic conjugate. Subsequently, we developed a kidney-targeted and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive drug delivery system based on the flash nanocomplexation method to deliver a well-known intracellular calcium chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N&amp;rsquo;,N&amp;rsquo;-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM, BA), with the goal of rescuing renal cell damage via rapidly scavenging of intracellularly overloaded Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced AKI rat model, a single dose of as-prepared formulation (BA 100 μg·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) 6 h post-reperfusion significantly reduced renal function indicators by more than 60% within 12 h, significantly alleviated tissular pathological changes, ameliorated tissular oxidative damage, significantly inhibited apoptosis of renal tubular cells and the expression of renal tubular marker kidney injury molecule 1, etc., thus greatly reducing the risk of kidney failure. Mechanistically, the treatment with BA-loaded NPs significantly inhibited the activation of the ER stress cascade response (IRE1-TRAF2-JNK, ATF4-CHOP, and ATF6 axis) and regulated the downstream apoptosis-related pathway while also reducing the inflammatory response. The BA-loaded NPs hold great promise as a potential therapy for I/R injury-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dual-Responsive STAT3 Inhibitor Nanoprodrug Combined with Oncolytic Virus Elicits Synergistic Antitumor Immune Responses by Igniting Pyroptosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy shows excellent efficacy against malignancies; however, insufficient tumor immunogenicity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment are considered as the two major stumbling blocks to a broad ICB response. Here, we report a combinational therapeutic strategy combining tumor microenvironment reactive oxygen species (ROS)/pH dual-responsive signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor nanoprodrugs MPNPs with oncolytic herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) virotherapy to synergistically ignite pyroptosis for enhancing immunotherapy. MPNPs exhibited a certain level of tumor accumulation, reduce tumor cell stemness, and enhance antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, the simultaneous application of oncolytic viruses (OVs) confers MPNPs with higher tumor penetration capacity and remarkable gasdermin E-mediated pyroptosis, thereby reshaping the tumor microenvironment and transforming &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; tumors into &amp;ldquo;hot&amp;rdquo; ones. This &amp;ldquo;fire of immunity&amp;rdquo; strategy successfully activates robust T cell-dependent antitumor responses, potentiating ICB effects against local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis in preclinical &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; murine triple-negative breast cancer and syngeneic oral cancer models. Collectively, this work may pave a new way and offer an unprecedented opportunity for the combination of OVs with nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macrophage Membrane-Coated Nano-Gemcitabine Promotes Lymphocyte Infiltration and Synergizes AntiPD-L1 to Restore the Tumoricidal Function</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36525314/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited lymphocyte infiltration and exhaustion of tumoricidal functions in solid tumors remain a formidable obstacle to cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we designed a macrophage membrane-coated nano-gemcitabine system (MNGs) to promote lymphocyte infiltration and then synergized anti-programmed death ligand 1 (antiPD-L1) to reinvigorate the exhausted lymphocytes. MNGs exhibited effective intratumor-permeating and responsive drug-releasing capacity, produced notable elimination of versatile immunosuppressive cells, and promoted lymphocyte infiltration into cancer cell regions in tumors, but over 50% of these infiltrated lymphocytes were in the exhausted state. Compared with MNG monotherapy, the MNGs+antiPD-L1 combination produced 31.77% and 30.63% reduction of exhausted CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and 2.83- and 3.17-fold increases of interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-positive subtypes, respectively, thereby resulting in considerable therapeutic benefits in several tumor models. Thus, MNGs provide an encouraging strategy to promote lymphocyte infiltration and synergize antiPD-L1 to restore their tumoricidal function for cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Injectable MMP1-sensitive microspheres with spatiotemporally controlled exosome release promote neovascularized bone healing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36481504/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exos) can recruit stem cells for bone repair, with neovessels serving as the main migratory channel for stem cells to the injury site. However, existing exosome (Exo) delivery strategies cannot reach the angiogenesis phase following bone injury. To that end, an enzyme-sensitive Exo delivery material that responds to neovessel formation during the angiogenesis phase was designed in the present study to achieve spatiotemporally controlled Exo release. Herein, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) was found to be highly expressed in neovascularized bone; as a result, we proposed an injectable MMP1-sensitive hydrogel microspheres (KGE) made using a microfluidic chip prepared by mixing self-assembling peptide (KLDL-MMP1), GelMA, and BMSC-Exos. The results revealed that KGE microspheres had a uniform diameter of 50-70 μm, ideal for minimally invasive injection and could release exosomes in response to MMP1 expression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that KGE had less cytotoxicity and could promote the migration and osteodifferentiation of BMSCs. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that KGE could promote bone repair during angiogenesis by recruiting CD90+ stem cells via neovessels. Collectively, our results suggest that injectable enzyme-responsive KGE microspheres could be a promising Exo-secreting material for accelerating neovascularized bone healing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Exosomes can spread through blood vessels and activate stem cells to participate in bone repair, but under normal circumstances, exosomes lacking sustained-release delivery materials cannot be maintained until the angiogenesis phase. In this study, we found that MMP1 was highly expressed in neovascularized bone, then we proposed an MMP1-sensitive injectable microsphere that carries exosomes and responds temporally and spatially to neovascularization, which maximizes the ability of exosomes to recruit stem cells. Different from previous strategies that focus on promoting angiogenesis to accelerate bone healing, this is a brand new delivery strategy that is stimuli-responsive to neovessel formation. In addition, the preparation of self-assembled peptide microspheres by a microfluidic chip is also proposed for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messenger RNA has now been used to vaccinate millions of people. However, the diversity of pulmonary pathologies, including infections, genetic disorders, asthma and others, reveals the lung as an important organ to directly target for future RNA therapeutics and preventatives. Here we report the screening of 166 polymeric nanoparticle formulations for functional delivery to the lungs, obtained from a combinatorial synthesis approach combined with a low-dead-volume nose-only inhalation system for mice. We identify P76, a poly-β-amino-thio-ester polymer, that exhibits increased expression over formulations lacking the thiol component, delivery to different animal species with varying RNA cargos and low toxicity. P76 allows for dose sparing when delivering an mRNA-expressed Cas13a-mediated treatment in a SARS-CoV-2 challenge model, resulting in similar efficacy to a 20-fold higher dose of a neutralizing antibody. Overall, the combinatorial synthesis approach allowed for the discovery of promising polymeric formulations for future RNA pharmaceutical development for the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A multivalent nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine against all known influenza virus subtypes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seasonal influenza vaccines offer little protection against pandemic influenza virus strains. It is difficult to create effective prepandemic vaccines because it is uncertain which influenza virus subtype will cause the next pandemic. In this work, we developed a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA)-lipid nanoparticle vaccine encoding hemagglutinin antigens from all 20 known influenza A virus subtypes and influenza B virus lineages. This multivalent vaccine elicited high levels of cross-reactive and subtype-specific antibodies in mice and ferrets that reacted to all 20 encoded antigens. Vaccination protected mice and ferrets challenged with matched and mismatched viral strains, and this protection was at least partially dependent on antibodies. Our studies indicate that mRNA vaccines can provide protection against antigenically variable viruses by simultaneously inducing antibodies against multiple antigens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have increasingly been recognized as important cell surrogates influencing many pathophysiological processes, including cellular homeostasis, cancer progression, neurologic disease, and infectious disease. These behaviors enable EVs broad application prospects for clinical application in disease diagnosis and treatment. Many studies suggest that EVs are superior to conventional synthetic carriers in terms of drug delivery and circulating biomarkers for early disease diagnosis, opening up new frontiers for modern theranostics. Despite these clinical potential, EVs containing diverse cellular components, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites are highly heterogeneous and small size. The limitation of preparatory, engineering and analytical technologies for EVs poses technical barriers to clinical translation. This article aims at present a critical overview of emerging technologies in EVs field for biomedical applications and challenges involved in their clinic translations. The current methods for isolation and identification of EVs are discussed. Additionally, engineering strategies developed to enhance scalable production and improved cargo loading as well as tumor targeting are presented. The superior clinical potential of EVs, particularly in terms of different cell origins and their application in the next generation of diagnostic and treatment platforms, are clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A composite hydrogel containing resveratrol-laden nanoparticles and platelet-derived extracellular vesicles promotes wound healing in diabetic mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36309190/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic wounds are difficult to heal because of persistent inflammation and limited angiogenesis. Resveratrol (RES) is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent. Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEVs) are rich in growth factors and cytokines, which promote proliferation and angiogenesis. However, single drug treatment has limited efficacy and delivery efficiency. Bioengineering can improve the limited effect of single drugs by combining drugs and materials to obtain complementary or cooperative bioengineered drugs. In this study, gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and silk fibroin glycidyl methacrylate (SFMA) were used to synthesize GelMA/SFMA composite hydrogels with suitable mechanical properties, swelling ratio and biodegradability. The composite hydrogel was used as a wound dressing for sustained drug release. RES was loaded into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) to synthesize MSN-RES to enhance the release dynamic, and MSN-RES and PDEVs were combined with the composite hydrogels to form GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels. The GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs had low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility, inhibited macrophage iNOS expression, and promoted the tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. In a diabetic mouse wound model, the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α and iNOS, increased the expression of anti-inflammatory factors TGF-β1 and Arg-1, promoted angiogenesis, and accelerated wound healing. Interestingly, the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels promoted the expression of extracellular purinergic signaling pathway-related CD73 and adenosine 2A receptor (A2A-R). Therefore, the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels could be used as wound dressings to regulate the inflammation and angiogenesis of diabetic wounds and accelerate wound healing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Drugs often fail to function because of a continuous oxidative stress microenvironment and inflammation. Here, a GelMA/SFMA hydrogel, with enhanced mechanical properties and liquid absorption ability, is proposed for sustained release of drugs. In addition to carrying platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEVs) with pro-angiogenic effects, the hydrogels were also loaded with nanoparticle-encapsulated resveratrol with anti-inflammatory activities, aiming to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the wound microenvironment, such that the wound could receive proliferative repair signals to achieve sequential treatment and heal quickly. We also experimentally predicted that the regulatory mechanism of the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs in wound healing might be related to the extracellular purinergic signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dressing blood-contacting devices with platelet membrane enables large-scale multifunctional biointerfacing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/matt.2022.05.018/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platelet membrane were first used for coating macroscale blood-contacting devices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platelet-membrane coating (PMC) endows material-improved biocompatibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biofunctional proteins confer favorable performance on PMC-modified vascular stents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, cloaking materials with platelet membranes have been widely studied, mainly focused on covering nanosized materials but rarely forwarded to dressing large-scale materials. Herein, a platelet-membrane coating (PMC) constructed on the surface of a macroscopic device is reported, driven by the spontaneous fusion of platelet-membrane vesicles (PMVs) with a negatively charged superhydrophilic surface. The coating contains not only phospholipids but also a variety of functional proteins of the platelet membrane, which is a further leap compared with surface-modification strategies of imitating cell-membrane structure with inert synthetic amphiphilic molecules. The preservation of membrane proteins by dressing PMC endows the surface of macroscopic devices with bioactivity. The implantation of vascular stents covered with PMC demonstrates the potential to address the desired biointerface properties, such as thromboprotection and anti-inflammation, and promote re-endothelialization. Overall, dressing large-scale blood-contacting materials with PMC provides a multifunctional biointerface by naturally preserved membrane proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune diseases are the third most common disease influencing the quality of life of many patients. Here, a programmed cell death-ligand 1 + (PD-L1) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs-PD-L1) using lentivirus-mediated gene transfection technology is developed for reconfiguration of the local immune microenvironment of affected tissue in autoimmune diseases. MSC-sEVs-PD-L1 exhibits an impressive ability to regulate various activated immune cells to an immunosuppressed state in vitro. More importantly, in dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and imiquimod-induced psoriasis mouse models, a significantly high accumulation of MSC-sEVs-PD-L1 is observed in the inflamed tissues compared to the PD-L1+ MSCs. Therapeutic efficiency in both UC and psoriasis mouse disease models is demonstrated using MSC-sEVs-PD-L1 to reshape the inflammatory ecosystem in the local immune context. A technology is developed using MSC-sEVs-PD-L1 as a natural delivery platform for autoimmune diseases treatment with high clinical potential.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In situ gas foaming based on magnesium particle degradation: A novel approach to fabricate injectable macroporous hydrogels</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injectable hydrogels are attractive biomaterials for cell delivery in tissue engineering. However, the in vivo viability of transplanted cells remains limited. Typically, macroporous structures constructed in hydrogels are utilized to enhance oxygen and nutrients diffusion for cell survival and to promote integration between the material and host tissue. A new gas-foaming method to generate pores was proposed by directly adding Mg particles into cell-laden hydrogel solutions, taking advantage of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas formed during the degradation of Mg. The optimization design of the size and amount of Mg particles added into the hydrogels was investigated. Improved cell viability and proliferation were demonstrated in the group with Mg particles. Additionally, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions generated during Mg degradation facilitated the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells encapsulated in hydrogels. Extensive vascularized bone regeneration in the femoral defects of rats revealed that the use of Mg particles as the foaming agent is feasible, endowing injectable hydrogels with optimized porosity and enhanced bioactivity, and providing a new strategy for future designs of porous hydrogels in tissue engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
