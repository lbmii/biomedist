      <title>Sesamin Induces the Transdifferentiation of Type II Alveolar Epithelial Cells via AnnexinA1 and TRPV1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) with high rates of morbidity is often accompanied by the apoptosis in the type I alveolar epithelial cells (ATIs). Thus, the transdifferentiation of type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATIIs) into ATIs is crucial for the maintenance of alveolar epithelial functions. We aimed to elucidate the role of sesamin in the transdifferentiation of ATIIs to ATIs and the involvement of the TRPV1/AKT pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In vivo, the mouse model of ALI was simulated by intraperitoneal and intratracheal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. The protective effects of sesamin on ALI were investigated using the survival rate, lung/body weight ratio, histological analysis of lung with HE staining, and mRNA levels of inflammatory factors. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence detection of ATIs marker AQP5 were used to evaluate the protective effect of sesamin on ATIs. Western blot, EdU, and qPCR analyses were applied to detect changes in apoptosis, proliferation, and transdifferentiation markers of ATII A549 cell lines. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to detect the involvement and relationships between the sesamin receptors (ANXA1 and TRPV1) and the AKT pathway in transdifferentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Sesamin (200 mg/kg) significantly improved LPS-induced ALI and inhibited LPS-induced ATIs reduction. A low concentration of sesamin (20 Î¼M) promoted the transdifferentiation of ATIIs to ATIs. Both ANXA1 and TRPV1 were involved in sesamin-promoted transdifferentiation, while the P-AKT (S473) level was down-regulated by TRPV1 siRNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Sesamin may promote transdifferentiation of ATII to ATI to ultimately rescue ALI, with TRPV1/AKT pathway involved in this transdifferentiation. This study revealed a novel role of sesamin in promoting the transdifferentiation of ATIIs to ATIs, providing experimental supports for the potential targets of ALI therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cytosolic DNA sensing by cGAS/STING promotes TRPV2-mediated Ca2&#43; release to protect stressed replication forks</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36696898/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replication stress induces TRPV2-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from the ER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STING binds to and represses TRPV2 on the ER in the absence of replication stress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cytosolic self-DNA-induced cGAMP promotes STING dissociation from TRPV2 and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oncogene-induced replication stress also activates the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent fork protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protection of DNA replication forks under stress is essential for genome maintenance and cancer suppression. One mechanism of fork protection involves an elevation in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), which in turn activates CaMKK2 and AMPK to prevent uncontrolled fork processing by Exo1. How replication stress triggers [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; elevation is unclear. Here, we report a role of cytosolic self-DNA (cytosDNA) and the ion channel TRPV2 in [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; induction and fork protection. Replication stress leads to the generation of ssDNA and dsDNA species that, upon translocation into cytoplasm, trigger the activation of the sensor protein cGAS and the production of cGAMP. The subsequent binding of cGAMP to STING causes its dissociation from TRPV2, leading to TRPV2 derepression and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from the ER, which in turn activates the downstream signaling cascade to prevent fork degradation. This Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent genome protection pathway is also activated in response to replication stress caused by oncogene activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DNA topoisomerase 2-associated proteins PATL1 and PATL2 regulate the biogenesis of hERG K&#43; channels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36608291/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel conducts a rapidly activating delayed rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current (I&lt;sub&gt;Kr&lt;/sub&gt;), which is essential for normal electrical activity of the heart. Precise regulation of hERG channel biogenesis is critical for serving its physiological functions, and deviations from the regulation result in human diseases. However, the mechanism underlying the precise regulation of hERG channel biogenesis remains elusive. Here, by using forward genetic screen, we found that PATR-1, the &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; homolog of the yeast DNA topoisomerase 2-associated protein PAT1, is a critical regulator for the biogenesis of UNC-103, the ERG K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;. A loss-of-function mutation in patr-1 down-regulates the expression level of UNC-103 proteins and suppresses the phenotypic defects resulted from a gain-of-function mutation in the unc-103 gene. Furthermore, downregulation of PATL1 and PATL2, the human homologs of PAT1, decreases protein levels and the current density of native hERG channels in SH-SY5Y cells and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Knockdown of PATL1 and PATL2 elongates the duration of action potentials in hiPSC-CMs, suggesting that PATL1 and PATL2 affect the function of hERG channels and hence electrophysiological characteristics in the human heart. Further studies found that PATL1 and PATL2 interact with TFIIE, a general transcription factor required for forming the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex, and dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that PATL1 and PATL2 facilitate the transcription of hERG mRNAs. Together, our study discovers that evolutionarily conserved DNA topoisomerase 2-associated proteins regulate the biogenesis of hERG channels via a transcriptional mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The ion transporter Na&#43;-K&#43;-ATPase enables pathological B cell survival in the kidney microenvironment of lupus nephritis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36724234/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kidney is a comparatively hostile microenvironment characterized by highsodium concentrations; however, lymphocytes infiltrate and survive therein in autoimmune diseases such as lupus. The effects of sodium-lymphocyte interactions on tissue injury in autoimmune diseases and the mechanisms used by infiltrating lymphocytes to survive the highsodium environment of the kidney are not known. Here, we show that kidney-infiltrating B cells in lupus adapt to elevated sodium concentrations and that expression of sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase) correlates with the ability of infiltrating cells to survive. Pharmacological inhibition of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase and genetic knockout of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase Î³ subunit resulted in reduced B cell infiltration into kidneys and amelioration of proteinuria. B cells in human lupus nephritis biopsies also had high expression of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase. Our study reveals that kidney-infiltrating B cells in lupus initiate a tissue adaption program in response to sodium stress and identifies Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase as an organ-specific therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The sodium channel subunit SCNN1B suppresses colorectal cancer via suppression of active c-Raf and MAPK signaling cascade</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36564468/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rising worldwide. Here, we identified SCNN1B as an outlier down-regulated in CRC and it functions as a tumor suppressor. SCNN1B mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated in primary CRC and CRC cells. In a tissue microarray cohort (N = 153), SCNN1B protein was an independent prognostic factor for favorable outcomes in CRC. Ectopic expression of SCNN1B in CRC cell lines suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, and suppressed cell migration in vitro. Xenograft models validated tumor suppressive function of SCNN1B in vivo. Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that SCNN1B correlates with KRAS signaling. Consistently, MAPK qPCR and kinase arrays revealed that SCNN1B suppressed MAPK signaling. In particular, SCNN1B overexpression suppressed p-MEK/p-ERK expression and SRE-mediated transcription activities, confirming blockade of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. Mechanistically, SCNN1B did not affect KRAS activation, instead impairing activation of c-Raf by inducing its inhibitory phosphorylation and targeting active c-Raf for degradation. The ectopic expression of c-Raf fully rescued cell proliferation and colony formation in SCNN1B-overexpressing CRC cells, confirming c-Raf as the principal molecular target of SCNN1B. In summary, we identified SCNN1B as a tumor suppressor by functioning as a c-Raf antagonist, which in turn suppressed oncogenic MEK-ERK signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging roles of mechanosensitive ion channels in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36539808/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a devastating respiratory disorder with high rates of mortality and morbidity, but the detailed underlying mechanisms of ALI/ARDS remain largely unknown. Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), including epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Piezo channels, transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), and two-pore domain potassium ion (K2P) channels, are highly expressed in lung tissues, and the activity of these MSCs can be modulated by mechanical forces (e.g., mechanical ventilation) and other stimuli (e.g., LPS, hyperoxia). Dysfunction of MSCs has been found in various types of ALI/ARDS, and MSCs play a key role in regulating alveolar fluid clearance, alveolar epithelial/endothelial barrier function, the inflammatory response and surfactant secretion in ALI/ARDS lungs. Targeting MSCs exerts therapeutic effects in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. In this review, we summarize the structure and functions of several well-recognized MSCs, the role of MSCs in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and recent advances in the pharmacological and molecular modulation of MSCs in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. According to the current literature, targeting MSCs might be a very promising therapeutic approach against ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Suppression of PD-L1 release from small extracellular vesicles promotes systemic anti-tumor immunity by targeting ORAI1 calcium channels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36482876/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockade of immune checkpoints as a strategy of cancer cells to overcome the immune response has received ample attention in cancer research recently. In particular, expression of PD-L1 by various cancer cells has become a paradigm in this respect. Delivery of PD-L1 to its site of action occurs either by local diffusion, or else by transport via small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, commonly referred to as exosomes). Many steps of sEVs formation, their packaging with PD-L1 and their release into the extracellular space have been studied in detail. The likely dependence of release on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signaling, however, has received little attention. This is surprising, since the intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-concentration is known as a prominent regulator of many secretory processes. Here, we report on the roles of three Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent proteins in regulating release of PD-L1-containing sEVs, as well as on the growth of tumors in mouse models. We show that sEVs release in cancer cell lines is Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent and the knockdown of the gene coding the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel protein ORAI1 reduces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signals and release of sEVs. Consequently, the T cell response is reinvigorated and tumor progression in mouse models is retarded. Furthermore, analysis of protein expression patterns in samples from human cancer tissue shows that the ORAI1 gene is significantly upregulated. Such upregulation is identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor for survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We show that reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signaling after knockdown of ORAI1 gene also compromises the activity of melanophilin and Synaptotagmin-like protein 2, two proteins, which are important for correct localization of secretory organelles within cancer cells and their transport to sites of exocytosis. Thus, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel ORAI1 and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent proteins of the secretion pathway emerge as important targets for understanding and manipulating immune checkpoint blockade by PD-L1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liquiritigenin protects against myocardial ischemic by inhibiting oxidative stress, apoptosis, and L-type Ca2&#43; channels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35747908/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquiritigenin (Lq) offers cytoprotective effects against various cardiac injuries, but its beneficial effects on myocardial ischemic (MI) injury and the related mechanisms remain unclear. In the in vivo study, an animal model of MI was induced by intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol (Iso, 85 mg/kg). ECG, heart rate, serum levels of CK and CK-MB, histopathological changes, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were all measured. In vitro, H9c2 cells were divided into four groups and treated for 24 hr with liquiritigenin (30 Î¼mol/L and 100 Î¼mol/L) followed with CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (800 Î¼mol/L) for another 24 hr. Cell viability, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) were then assessed. The L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current (I&lt;sub&gt;Ca-L&lt;/sub&gt;) was detected using a patch clamp technique on isolated rat ventricular myocytes. The myocyte contraction and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients were measured using an IonOptix detection system. The remarkable cardiac injury and generation of intracellular ROS induced by Iso were alleviated via treatment with Lq. CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; administration induced cell apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload in H9c2; Lq reduces these deleterious effects of CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Meanwhile, Lq blocked I&lt;sub&gt;Ca-L&lt;/sub&gt; in a dose-dependent manner. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of Lq was 110.87 Î¼mol/L. Lq reversibly reduced the amplitude of cell contraction as well as the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. The results show that Lq protects against MI injury by antioxidation, antiapoptosis, counteraction mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibition of I&lt;sub&gt;Ca-L&lt;/sub&gt;, thus damping intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CaMK4 Promotes Acute Lung Injury Through NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation in Type II Alveolar Epithelial Cell</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35734175/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Type II alveolar epithelial cell (AEC II), in addition to its roles in maintaining lung homeostasis, takes an active role in inflammatory response during acute lung injury (ALI). Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK4) activated by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin signaling, has been implicated in immune responses. This study was to investigate the roles of CaMK4 in the development of ALI and the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; CaMK4 inhibitor KN-93 was used to investigate the effects of CaMK4 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The effects of KN-93 on disease development of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI were also evaluated. The role of CaMK4 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation was explored in human AEC II cell line A549 using KN-93 or CaMK4 siRNA. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was measured by histology immunofluorescence and Western blot. IL-1Î² and IL-18 were measured by ELISA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Phosphorylation of CaMK4 and the expression of NLRP3 and Caspase-1 p20 were increased in the lungs of LPS-induced ALI mice, which was suppressed by KN-93 as measured by Western blot. Further, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was detected in AEC II from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and LPS-induced ALI mice. In vitro, inhibition or silencing CaMK4 in AEC II significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, resulting in reduced IL-1Î² production. The inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and decreased IL-1Î²/IL-18 production by KN-93 led to reduced inflammatory infiltration and ameliorated lung injury in LPS-induced ALI mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; CaMK4 controls the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in AEC II during LPS-induced ALI. CaMK4 inhibition could be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Non-invasive imaging of ion concentration distribution around cell spheroids by electrical impedance tomographic sensor printed on circuit board under temporal compensation by ion transport impedance model</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A non-invasive imaging called as PCB-EIT imaging has been proposed in order to image spatio-temporal ion concentration distribution around cell spheroids in 0.1 s of temporal resolution by a newly developed electrical impedance tomographic sensor printed on circuit board (PCB-EIT sensor). To realize the high temporal resolution in PCB-EIT imaging, the temporal compensation by the ion transport impedance model interpolating the extracted resistance of extracellular solution &lt;em&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; obtained from the Cole-Cole equation is employed. To confirm the performance of PCB-EIT imaging, the ion concentration distribution around three cell spheroid types (GFP type (GFPT), Histone type (HT) and wild type (WT)) which are electrically different due to green fluorescent protein expressed in cytoplasm and nucleus of MRC-5. As a result, spatio-temporal ion concentration distributions due to ion transport from cell spheroid are successfully reconstructed by PCB-EIT imaging. The images by PCB-EIT imaging are validated with those by fluorescence ratio imaging within the distribution error &lt;em&gt;Îµ&lt;sub&gt;dis&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of 0.046 Â± 0.0038 in maximum. For an evaluation of the ion diffusivity &lt;em&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of each cell spheroid type by the mass transfer simulation based on Fick&amp;rsquo;s law, &lt;em&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of GFPT shows the highest value among the three cell types in the earlier time range from 4 s, while &lt;em&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of HT shows the highest one in the time range from 15 s, which indicates that PCB-EIT imaging is able to evaluate the ion transport characteristics of each cell type.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of BKCa channels protects neonatal hearts against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35393410/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels are large-conductance calcium and voltage-activated potassium channels that are heterogeneously expressed in a wide array of cells. Activation of BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels present in mitochondria of adult ventricular cardiomyocytes is implicated in cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. However, the BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channel&amp;rsquo;s activity has never been detected in the plasma membrane of adult ventricular cardiomyocytes. In this study, we report the presence of the BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channel in the plasma membrane and mitochondria of neonatal murine and rodent cardiomyocytes, which protects the heart on inhibition but not activation. Furthermore, K+ currents measured in neonatal cardiomyocyte (NCM) was sensitive to iberiotoxin (IbTx), suggesting the presence of BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels in the plasma membrane. Neonatal hearts subjected to IR when post-conditioned with NS1619 during reoxygenation increased the myocardial infarction whereas IbTx reduced the infarct size. In agreement, isolated NCM also presented increased apoptosis on treatment with NS1619 during hypoxia and reoxygenation, whereas IbTx reduced TUNEL-positive cells. In NCMs, activation of BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species post HR injury. Electrophysiological characterization of NCMs indicated that NS1619 increased the beat period, field, and action potential duration, and decreased the conduction velocity and spike amplitude. In contrast, IbTx had no impact on the electrophysiological properties of NCMs. Taken together, our data established that inhibition of plasma membrane BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels in the NCM protects neonatal heart/cardiomyocytes from IR injury. Furthermore, the functional disparity observed towards the cardioprotective activity of BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels in adults compared to neonatal heart could be attributed to their differential localization.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The volume-regulated anion channel LRRC8C suppresses T cell function by regulating cyclic dinucleotide transport and STING-p53 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35105987/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is formed by LRRC8 proteins and is responsible for the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) after hypotonic cell swelling. Besides chloride, VRAC transports other molecules, for example, immunomodulatory cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) including 2&#39;3&amp;rsquo;cGAMP. Here, we identify LRRC8C as a critical component of VRAC in T cells, where its deletion abolishes VRAC currents and RVD. T cells of &lt;em&gt;Lrrc8c&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice have increased cell cycle progression, proliferation, survival, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and cytokine production-a phenotype associated with downmodulation of p53 signaling. Mechanistically, LRRC8C mediates the transport of 2&#39;3&amp;rsquo;cGAMP in T cells, resulting in STING and p53 activation. Inhibition of STING recapitulates the phenotype of LRRC8C-deficient T cells, whereas overexpression of p53 inhibits their enhanced T cell function. &lt;em&gt;Lrrc8c&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice have exacerbated T cell-dependent immune responses, including immunity to influenza A virus infection and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our results identify cGAMP uptake through LRRC8C and STING-p53 signaling as a new inhibitory signaling pathway in T cells and adaptive immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors as an early, first-line therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34894038/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have recently been recommended as a foundational therapy for patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) because of their favourable effects on mortality, clinical events and quality of life. While clinical practice guidelines have recommended dapagliflozin or empagliflozin in all patients with HFrEF, or sotagliflozin in those with HFrEF and concomitant diabetes, the timing and practical integration of these drugs in clinical practice is less well defined. We propose that these drugs are candidates for early, upfront administration to patients with newly diagnosed HFrEF and for patients hospitalized with HF. Growing evidence has established early benefits, with clinically meaningful reductions in clinical events that reach statistical significance within days to weeks, following dapagliflozin, empagliflozin or, in diabetic patients, sotagliflozin initiation. Secondly, although major clinical trials have tested these drugs in patients already receiving background HF therapy, secondary analyses showed that their efficacy is independent of that. Third, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally safe and well tolerated, with clinical trial data reporting minimal effects on blood pressure, glycaemia-related adverse events, and no excess in acute kidney injury. Rather, they exert renal protective effects and reduce risk of hyperkalaemia, properties that favour initiation, tolerance and persistence of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. This review supports the early initiation of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin (or sotagliflozin limited to patients with diabetes) to rapidly improve clinical outcome and quality of life of HFrEF patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nano-Enabled Reposition of Proton Pump Inhibitors for TLR Inhibition: Toward A New Targeted Nanotherapy for Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34816630/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation in macrophages plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). While TLR inhibition is a promising strategy to control the overwhelming inflammation in ALI, there still lacks effective TLR inhibitors for clinical uses to date. A unique class of peptide-coated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) is previously discovered, which effectively inhibited TLR signaling and protected mice from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. To fast translate such a discovery into potential clinical applicable nanotherapeutics, herein an elegant strategy of &amp;ldquo;nano-enabled drug repurposing&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;nano-targeting&amp;rdquo; is introduced to empower the existing drugs for new uses. Combining transcriptome sequencing with Connectivity Map analysis, it is identified that the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) share similar mechanisms of action to the discovered GNP-based TLR inhibitor. It is confirmed that PPIs (including omeprazole) do inhibit endosomal TLR signaling and inflammatory responses in macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and exhibits anti-inflammatory activity in an LPS-induced ALI mouse model. The omeprazole is then formulated into a nanoform with liposomes to enhance its macrophage targeting ability and the therapeutic efficacy in vivo. This research provides a new translational strategy of nano-enabled drug repurposing to translate bioactive nanoparticles into clinically used drugs and targeted nano-therapeutics for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
