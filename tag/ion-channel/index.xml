      <title>DNA topoisomerase 2-associated proteins PATL1 and PATL2 regulate the biogenesis of hERG K&#43; channels</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel conducts a rapidly activating delayed rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current (I&lt;sub&gt;Kr&lt;/sub&gt;), which is essential for normal electrical activity of the heart. Precise regulation of hERG channel biogenesis is critical for serving its physiological functions, and deviations from the regulation result in human diseases. However, the mechanism underlying the precise regulation of hERG channel biogenesis remains elusive. Here, by using forward genetic screen, we found that PATR-1, the &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; homolog of the yeast DNA topoisomerase 2-associated protein PAT1, is a critical regulator for the biogenesis of UNC-103, the ERG K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;. A loss-of-function mutation in patr-1 down-regulates the expression level of UNC-103 proteins and suppresses the phenotypic defects resulted from a gain-of-function mutation in the unc-103 gene. Furthermore, downregulation of PATL1 and PATL2, the human homologs of PAT1, decreases protein levels and the current density of native hERG channels in SH-SY5Y cells and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Knockdown of PATL1 and PATL2 elongates the duration of action potentials in hiPSC-CMs, suggesting that PATL1 and PATL2 affect the function of hERG channels and hence electrophysiological characteristics in the human heart. Further studies found that PATL1 and PATL2 interact with TFIIE, a general transcription factor required for forming the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex, and dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that PATL1 and PATL2 facilitate the transcription of hERG mRNAs. Together, our study discovers that evolutionarily conserved DNA topoisomerase 2-associated proteins regulate the biogenesis of hERG channels via a transcriptional mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The sodium channel subunit SCNN1B suppresses colorectal cancer via suppression of active c-Raf and MAPK signaling cascade</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36564468/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rising worldwide. Here, we identified SCNN1B as an outlier down-regulated in CRC and it functions as a tumor suppressor. SCNN1B mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated in primary CRC and CRC cells. In a tissue microarray cohort (N = 153), SCNN1B protein was an independent prognostic factor for favorable outcomes in CRC. Ectopic expression of SCNN1B in CRC cell lines suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, and suppressed cell migration in vitro. Xenograft models validated tumor suppressive function of SCNN1B in vivo. Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that SCNN1B correlates with KRAS signaling. Consistently, MAPK qPCR and kinase arrays revealed that SCNN1B suppressed MAPK signaling. In particular, SCNN1B overexpression suppressed p-MEK/p-ERK expression and SRE-mediated transcription activities, confirming blockade of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. Mechanistically, SCNN1B did not affect KRAS activation, instead impairing activation of c-Raf by inducing its inhibitory phosphorylation and targeting active c-Raf for degradation. The ectopic expression of c-Raf fully rescued cell proliferation and colony formation in SCNN1B-overexpressing CRC cells, confirming c-Raf as the principal molecular target of SCNN1B. In summary, we identified SCNN1B as a tumor suppressor by functioning as a c-Raf antagonist, which in turn suppressed oncogenic MEK-ERK signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging roles of mechanosensitive ion channels in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36539808/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a devastating respiratory disorder with high rates of mortality and morbidity, but the detailed underlying mechanisms of ALI/ARDS remain largely unknown. Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), including epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Piezo channels, transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), and two-pore domain potassium ion (K2P) channels, are highly expressed in lung tissues, and the activity of these MSCs can be modulated by mechanical forces (e.g., mechanical ventilation) and other stimuli (e.g., LPS, hyperoxia). Dysfunction of MSCs has been found in various types of ALI/ARDS, and MSCs play a key role in regulating alveolar fluid clearance, alveolar epithelial/endothelial barrier function, the inflammatory response and surfactant secretion in ALI/ARDS lungs. Targeting MSCs exerts therapeutic effects in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. In this review, we summarize the structure and functions of several well-recognized MSCs, the role of MSCs in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and recent advances in the pharmacological and molecular modulation of MSCs in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. According to the current literature, targeting MSCs might be a very promising therapeutic approach against ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Suppression of PD-L1 release from small extracellular vesicles promotes systemic anti-tumor immunity by targeting ORAI1 calcium channels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36482876/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockade of immune checkpoints as a strategy of cancer cells to overcome the immune response has received ample attention in cancer research recently. In particular, expression of PD-L1 by various cancer cells has become a paradigm in this respect. Delivery of PD-L1 to its site of action occurs either by local diffusion, or else by transport via small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, commonly referred to as exosomes). Many steps of sEVs formation, their packaging with PD-L1 and their release into the extracellular space have been studied in detail. The likely dependence of release on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signaling, however, has received little attention. This is surprising, since the intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-concentration is known as a prominent regulator of many secretory processes. Here, we report on the roles of three Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent proteins in regulating release of PD-L1-containing sEVs, as well as on the growth of tumors in mouse models. We show that sEVs release in cancer cell lines is Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent and the knockdown of the gene coding the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel protein ORAI1 reduces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signals and release of sEVs. Consequently, the T cell response is reinvigorated and tumor progression in mouse models is retarded. Furthermore, analysis of protein expression patterns in samples from human cancer tissue shows that the ORAI1 gene is significantly upregulated. Such upregulation is identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor for survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We show that reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signaling after knockdown of ORAI1 gene also compromises the activity of melanophilin and Synaptotagmin-like protein 2, two proteins, which are important for correct localization of secretory organelles within cancer cells and their transport to sites of exocytosis. Thus, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel ORAI1 and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent proteins of the secretion pathway emerge as important targets for understanding and manipulating immune checkpoint blockade by PD-L1.&lt;/p&gt;
