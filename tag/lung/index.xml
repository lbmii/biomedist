      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lkb1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency confers the Kras-mutant lung cancer with strong plasticity and the potential for adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation (AST). However, it remains largely unknown how &lt;em&gt;Lkb1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency dynamically regulates AST. Using the classical AST mouse model (&lt;em&gt;Kras&lt;sup&gt;LSL-G12D/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Lkb1&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, KL), we here comprehensively analyze the temporal transcriptomic dynamics of lung tumors at different stages by dynamic network biomarker (DNB) and identify the tipping point at which the Wnt signaling is abruptly suppressed by the excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through its downstream effector FOXO3A. Bidirectional genetic perturbation of the Wnt pathway using two different &lt;em&gt;Ctnnb1&lt;/em&gt; conditional knockout mouse strains confirms its essential role in the negative regulation of AST. Importantly, pharmacological activation of the Wnt pathway before but not after the tipping point inhibits squamous transdifferentiation, highlighting the irreversibility of AST after crossing the tipping point. Through comparative transcriptomic analyses of mouse and human tumors, we find that the lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma form a &amp;ldquo;Yin-Yang&amp;rdquo; counteracting network. Interestingly, inactivation of the Wnt pathway preferentially suppresses the adenomatous lineage TF network and thus disrupts the &amp;ldquo;Yin-Yang&amp;rdquo; homeostasis to lean towards the squamous lineage, whereas ectopic expression of NKX2-1, an adenomatous lineage TF, significantly dampens such phenotypic transition accelerated by the Wnt pathway inactivation. The negative correlation between the Wnt pathway and AST is further observed in a large cohort of human lung adenosquamous carcinoma. Collectively, our study identifies the tipping point of AST and highlights an essential role of the ROS-Wnt axis in dynamically orchestrating the homeostasis between adeno- and squamous-specific TF networks at the AST tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypercapnia alters stromal-derived Wnt production limiting β-catenin signaling and proliferation in alveolar type 2 cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistent symptoms and radiographic abnormalities suggestive of failed lung repair are among the most common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge. In mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, low tidal volumes to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury necessarily elevate blood CO2 levels, often leading to hypercapnia. The role of hypercapnia on lung repair after injury is not completely understood. Here, using a mouse model of hypercapnia exposure, cell lineage-tracing, spatial transcriptomics and 3D-cultures, we show that hypercapnia limits β-catenin signaling in AT2 cells, leading to their reduced proliferative capacity. Hypercapnia alters expression of major Wnts in PDGFRα+-fibroblasts from those maintaining AT2 progenitor activity towards those that antagonize β-catenin signaling thereby limiting progenitor function. Constitutive activation of β-catenin signaling in AT2 cells or treatment of organoid cultures with recombinant WNT3A protein bypasses the inhibitory effects of hypercapnia. Inhibition of AT2 proliferation in hypercapnic patients may contribute to impaired lung repair after injury, preventing sealing of the epithelial barrier, increasing lung flooding, ventilator dependency and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>microRNA-33 deficiency in macrophages enhances autophagy, improves mitochondrial homeostasis, and protects against lung fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36626225/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease. Recent findings have shown a marked metabolic reprogramming associated with changes in mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy during pulmonary fibrosis. The microRNA-33 (miR-33) family of microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded within the introns of SREBP (sterol regulatory element binding protein) genes are master regulators of sterol and fatty acid (FA) metabolism. miR-33 controls macrophage immuno-metabolic response and enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, FA oxidation, and cholesterol efflux. Here, we show that miR-33 levels are increased in Broncho Alveolar Lavage (BAL) cells isolated from IPF patients compared to healthy controls. We demonstrate that specific genetic ablation of miR-33 in macrophages protects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The absence of miR-33 in macrophages improves mitochondrial homeostasis and increases autophagy while decreasing inflammatory response after bleomycin injury. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of miR-33 in macrophages via administration of anti-miR-33 Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNA-33) attenuates fibrosis in different &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; mice and human models of pulmonary fibrosis. Together, these studies elucidate a major role of miR-33 in macrophages in the regulation of pulmonary fibrosis and uncover a novel therapeutic approach to treat this disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular imaging of chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) in experimental acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36626557/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study developed a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent that detects pulmonary inflammation during acute lung injury. The PET radiotracer uptake was highest in lung regions with high macrophage influx, and quantification of radiotracer uptake strongly correlated with the expression of established inflammatory markers. Further, this PET tracer was able to monitor treatment response to a clinically relevant treatment, providing information beyond what would be obtained by other imaging modalities, like computed tomography, alone. This knowledge will enhance our ability to noninvasively characterize and monitor molecular patterns of inflammation to help develop precision medicine approaches to treat the acutely injured lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of techniques for noninvasive imaging of inflammation has challenged precision medicine management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here, we determined the potential of positron emission tomography (PET) of chemokine-like receptor-1 (CMKLR1) to monitor lung inflammation in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide-induced injury. Lung uptake of a CMKLR1-targeting radiotracer, [&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu]NODAGA-CG34, was significantly increased in lipopolysaccharide-induced injury, correlated with the expression of multiple inflammatory markers, and reduced by dexamethasone treatment. Monocyte-derived macrophages, followed by interstitial macrophages and monocytes were the major CMKLR1-expressing leukocytes contributing to the increased tracer uptake throughout the first week of lipopolysaccharide-induced injury. The clinical relevance of CMKLR1 as a biomarker of lung inflammation in ARDS was confirmed using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets which showed significant increases in &lt;em&gt;CMKLR1&lt;/em&gt; expression among transcriptionally distinct subsets of lung monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 patients vs. controls. CMKLR1-targeted PET is a promising strategy to monitor the dynamics of lung inflammation and response to anti-inflammatory treatment in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1324 Protein Contributes to Mycobacterial Persistence and Causes Pathological Lung Injury in Mice by Inducing Ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36625672/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; (Mtb) is the pathogenic agent of tuberculosis (TB). Intracellular survival plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Mtb, a process that depends on an array of virulence factors for Mtb to colonize and proliferate within a host. Reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNS and ROS) are among the most effective antimycobacterial molecules generated by the host during infection. However, Mtb has evolved a number of proteins and enzymes to detoxify ROS and RNS. Secretory protein Rv1324, as a possible thioredoxin, might also have oxidoreductase activity against ROS and RNS during Mtb infection, and it is a potential virulence factor of Mtb. In this study, we investigated the biochemical properties of Mtb Rv1324 and its role in mycobacterial survival and virulence. The results showed that the Rv1324 protein had antioxidant activity and increased the survival of &lt;em&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/em&gt; that was exposed to ROS and RNS. In addition, Rv1324 enhanced the colonization ability of &lt;em&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/em&gt; in the lungs of mice. Further, mice infected with &lt;em&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/em&gt; harboring Rv1324 exhibited pathological injury and inflammation in the lung, which was mediated by ferroptosis. In summary, this study advances our understanding of the mechanisms of mycobacterial survival and pathogenesis, and it reveals a novel target for TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intracellular survival of &lt;em&gt;M. tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; (Mtb) plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis, which depends on various Mtb oxidoreductases that are resistant to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) that are generated by the host during Mtb infection. Secretory protein Rv1324 is a potential virulence factor of Mtb and is a possible thioredoxin that has oxidoreductase activity against ROS and RNS during Mtb infection. We investigated the biochemical properties of Mtb Rv1324 and its role in mycobacterial survival and virulence. It was confirmed that the Rv1324 protein had antioxidant activity and an increased mycobacterial resistance to ROS and RNS. In addition, Rv1324 enhanced mycobacterial persistence and induced pathological injury and inflammation in the lungs of mice by activating ferroptosis. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms of mycobacterial survival and pathogenesis, and it reveals a novel target for TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myofibroblast-Specific Inhibition of the Rho Kinase-MRTF-SRF Pathway Using Nanotechnology for the Prevention of Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36625494/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of myofibroblasts in the lung and progressive tissue scarring. Fibroblasts exist across a spectrum of states, from quiescence in health to activated myofibroblasts in the setting of injury. Highly activated myofibroblasts have a critical role in the establishment of fibrosis as the predominant source of type 1 collagen and pro-fibrotic mediators. Myofibroblasts are also highly contractile cells and can alter lung biomechanical properties through tissue contraction. . One of the ways myofibroblast activation occurs is through activation of the Rho/myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) / serum response factor (SRF) pathway, which signals through intracellular actin polymerization. However, concerns surrounding the pleiotropic and ubiquitous nature of these signaling pathways have limited the translation of inhibitory drugs. Herein, we demonstrate a novel therapeutic anti-fibrotic strategy utilizing myofibroblast-targeted nanoparticles containing a MTRF/SRF pathway inhibitor (CCG-1423) which has been shown to block myofibroblast activation in vitro. Myofibroblasts were preferentially targeted via the angiotensin 2 receptor, which has been shown to be selectively upregulated in animal and human studies. These nanoparticles were non-toxic and accumulated in lung myofibroblasts in the bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, reducing the number of these activated cells and their production of pro-fibrotic mediators. Ultimately, in a murine model of lung fibrosis, a single injection of these drug containing targeted nanoagents reduced fibrosis as compared to control mice. This approach has the potential to deliver personalized therapy by precisely targeting signaling pathways in a cell-specific manner, allowing increased efficacy with reduced deleterious off-target effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The main e-cigarette component vegetable glycerin enhances neutrophil migration and fibrosis in endotoxin-induced lung injury via p38 MAPK activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36627690/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the effects of vegetable glycerin (VG), a main e-cigarette constituent, on endotoxin-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Mice received intratracheal administration of 30% VG in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vehicle or only PBS (control) for 4 days. On Day 5, mice received an intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (LPS group and VG + LPS group) or PBS (VG group and control group). Lung histopathology, expression of chemokine receptors, and regulatory signaling were analyzed 24 h after the Day 5 treatment. VG significantly increased ALI-associated histopathological and fibrotic changes in both the VG group and LPS-induced ALI mice (VG + LPS group). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analyses revealed that VG administration resulted in upregulation of neutrophil markers [lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus G6D (Ly6G) and myeloperoxidase (MPO)] as well as upregulation of the expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a central mediator of fibrogenesis, in the lungs of both VG and VG + LPS groups. VG enhanced the expression of adhesion molecules [very late antigen 4 (VLA-4) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)] and increased activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) to prompt neutrophil recruitment in the lungs of mice with ALI. Intraperitoneal administration of a p38 inhibitor attenuated these histopathological changes significantly as well as VG-induced upregulation in expression of Ly6G, MPO, VLA-4, VCAM-1, TGF-β, and collagen-1 in mice with ALI. In conclusion, VG enhances neutrophil chemotaxis and fibrosis and it amplifies the inflammatory response associated with LPS-induced ALI in the lungs via enhancement of p38 MAPK activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient nanomedicines to repress the repolarization of M1 phenotype macrophages and therefore inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression for anti-inflammatory therapy is still a challenging task. We report here an original gene delivery nanoplatform based on pyrrolidinium-modified amphiphilic generation 1 phosphorus dendron (C12G1) nanomicelles with a rigid phosphorous dendron structure. The nanomicelles display higher gene delivery efficiency than the counterpart materials of pyrrolidinium-modified G1 phosphorus dendrimers, and meanwhile exhibit excellent cytocompatibility. The C12G1 nanomicelles can be employed to co-deliver the miRNA-146a mimic (miR-146a mimic) and miRNA-429 inhibitor (miR-429i) to inhibit the Toll-like receptor-4 signaling pathway and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, respectively, thus causing repression of M1 phenotype alveolar macrophage polarization. The developed C12G1/miR-mixture polyplexes enable efficient therapy of lipopolysaccharide-activated alveolar macrophages &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and an acute lung injury mouse model &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. The generated cationic phosphorus dendron nanomicelles may hold promising potential for anti-inflammatory gene therapy of other inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WWOX activates autophagy to alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury by regulating mTOR</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36621327/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by acute systemic inflammatory responses that may lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The clinical course of ALI/ARDS is variable; however, it has been reported that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) play a role in its development. The fragile chromosomal site gene WWOX is highly sensitive to genotoxic stress induced by environmental exposure and is an important candidate gene for exposure-related lung disease research. However, the expression of WWOX and its role in LPS-induced ALI still remain unidentified. This study investigated the expression of WWOX in mouse lung and epithelial cells and explored the role of WWOX in LPS-induced ALI model in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we explored one of the possible mechanisms by which WWOX alleviates ALI from the perspective of autophagy. Here, we observed that LPS stimulation reduced the expression of WWOX and the autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3β-II (MAP1LC3B/LC3B) in mouse lung epithelial and human epithelial (H292) cells. Overexpression of WWOX led to the activation of autophagy and inhibited inflammatory responses in LPS-induced ALI cells and mouse model. More importantly, we found that WWOX interacts with mechanistic target of rapamycin [serine/threonine kinase] (mTOR) and regulates mTOR and ULK-1 signaling-mediated autophagy. Thus, reduced WWOX levels were associated with LPS-induced ALI. WWOX can activate autophagy in lung epithelial cells and protect against LPS-induced ALI, which is partly related to the mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary inflammation as one of the extraintestinal manifestations of ulcerative colitis (UC) has attracted extensive attention, and its pathogenesis is closely related to gut dysbiosis. &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis&lt;/em&gt; subsp. lactis BL-99 (BL-99) can alleviate osteoporosis caused by UC, but less research has been done on other extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) caused by UC. This study aimed to explore the role and potential mechanisms of BL-99 on DSS-induced pulmonary complications in colitis mice. The results showed that BL-99 decreased weight loss, disease activity index score, colonic pathology score, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in colitis mice. BL-99 also alleviated DSS-induced lung pathological damage by suppressing the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory monocytes, and macrophages. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed lower abundances of several potentially pathogenic bacteria (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Burkholderia, Shigella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/em&gt;) and enrichment in specific beneficial bacteria (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Adlercreutzia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis&lt;/em&gt;) in colitis mice with BL-99 treatment. Targeted metabolomics suggested that BL-99 intervention promoted the production of intestinal acetate and butyrate. Finally, we observed that the pulmonary expression of primary acetate and butyrate receptors, including FFAR2, FFAR3, and, GPR109a, was up-regulated in BL-99-treated mice, which negatively correlated with inflammatory monocytes and macrophages. Altogether, these results suggest that BL-99 might be utilized as a probiotic intervention to prevent the incidence of colitis-related lung injury owing to its ability to shape the intestinal microbiota and suppress inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>c-JUN-mediated transcriptional responses in lymphatic endothelial cells are required for lung fluid clearance at birth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluid clearance mediated by lymphatic vessels is known to be essential for lung inflation and gas-exchange function during the transition from prenatal to postnatal life, yet the molecular mechanisms that regulate lymphatic function remain unclear. Here, we profiled the molecular features of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in embryonic and postnatal day (P) 0 lungs by single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. We identified that the expression of c-JUN is transiently upregulated in P0 LECs. Conditional knockout of Jun in LECs impairs the opening of lung lymphatic vessels at birth, leading to fluid retention in the lungs and neonatal death. We further demonstrated that increased mechanical pressure induces the expression of c-JUN in LECs. c-JUN regulates the opening of lymphatic vessels by modulating the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in LECs. Our study established the essential regulatory function of c-JUN-mediated transcriptional responses in facilitating lung lymphatic fluid clearance at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Maresin 1-LGR6 axis decreases respiratory syncytial virus-induced lung inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36595677/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution of infection is an active process with specific molecular and cellular mechanisms that temper inflammation and enhance pathogen clearance. Here, the specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) Maresin 1 (MaR1) inhibited respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced inflammation. inlerleukin-13 production from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC) and CD4 T helper type 2 cells was decreased by exogenous MaR1. In addition, MaR1 increased amphiregulin production and decreased RSV viral transcripts to promote resolution. MaR1 also promoted interferon-β production in mouse lung tissues and also in pediatric lung slices. MaR1 significantly inhibited the RSV-triggered aberrant inflammatory phenotype in FoxP3-expressing Tregs. The receptor for MaR1, leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6), was constitutively expressed on Tregs. Following RSV infection, mice lacking Lgr6 had exacerbated type 2 immune responses with an increased viral burden and blunted responses to MaR1. Together, these findings have uncovered a multi-pronged protective signaling axis for MaR1-Lgr6, improving Tregs&amp;rsquo;s suppressive function and upregulating host antiviral genes resulting in decreased viral burden and pathogen-mediated inflammation, ultimately promoting restoration of airway mucosal homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Staphylococcal virulence factor HlgB targets the endoplasmic-reticulum-resident E3 ubiquitin ligase AMFR to promote pneumonia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; invades cells and persists intracellularly, causing persistent inflammation that is notoriously difficult to treat. Here we investigated host-pathogen interactions underlying intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection in macrophages and discovered that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important cellular compartment for intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Using CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA library screening, we determined that the autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR), an ER-resident E3 ubiquitin ligase, played an essential role in mediating intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;-induced inflammation. AMFR directly interacted with TAK1-binding protein 3 (TAB3) in the ER, inducing K27-linked polyubiquitination of TAB3 on lysine 649 and promoting TAK1 activation. Moreover, the virulence factor γ-haemolysin B (HIgB) of &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; bound to the AMFR and regulated TAB3. Our findings highlight an unknown role of AMFR in intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection-induced pneumonia and suggest that pharmacological interruption of AMFR-mediated TAB3 signalling cascades and HIgB targeting may prevent invasive staphylococci-mediated pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>miRNome profiling of lung cancer metastases revealed a key role for miRNA-PD-L1 axis in the modulation of chemotherapy response</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is frequent at diagnosis and requires multimodal treatment approaches. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by surgery is the treatment of choice for operable locally advanced NSCLC (Stage IIIA). However, the majority of patients are NACT-resistant and show persistent lymph nodal metastases (LNmets) and an adverse outcome. Therefore, the identification of mechanisms and biomarkers of NACT resistance is paramount for ameliorating the prognosis of patients with Stage IIIA NSCLC. Here, we investigated the miRNome and transcriptome of chemo-naïve LNmets collected from patients with Stage IIIA NSCLC (N = 64). We found that a microRNA signature accurately predicts NACT response. Mechanistically, we discovered a miR-455-5p/PD-L1 regulatory axis which drives chemotherapy resistance, hallmarks metastases with active IFN-γ response pathway (an inducer of PD-L1 expression), and impacts T cells viability and relative abundances in tumor microenvironment (TME). Our data provide new biomarkers to predict NACT response and add molecular insights relevant for improving the management of patients with locally advanced NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>De Novo Design of Activatable Photoacoustic/Fluorescent Probes for Imaging Acute Lung Injury In Vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36584357/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective monitoring of the physiological progression of acute lung injury (ALI) in real time is crucial for early theranostics to reduce its high mortality. In particular, activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic molecule probes have attracted attention to assess ALI by detecting related indicators. However, the existing fluorophores often encounter issues of low retention in the lungs and slow clearance from the body, which compromise the probe&amp;rsquo;s actual capability for in situ imaging by intravenous injection in vivo. Herein, a novel near-infrared hemicyanines fluorophore (FJH) bearing a quaternary ammonium group was first developed by combining with the rational design and screening strategy. The properties of good hydrophilicity and blood circulation effectively enable FJH accumulation for lung imaging. Inspired by the high retention efficiency, the probe FJH-C that turns on fluorescence and photoacoustic signals in response to the ALI indicator (esterase) was subsequently synthesized. Notably, the probe FJH-C successfully achieved the selectivity and sensitivity toward esterase in vitro and in living cells. More importantly, FJH-C can be further used to assess lipopolysaccharides and silica-induced ALI through the desired fluo-photoacoustic signal. Therefore, this study not only shows the first activatable probe for real-time imaging of lung function but also highlights the fluorophore structure with high lung retention. It is believed that FJH and FJH-C can serve as an efficient platform to reveal the pathological progression of other lung diseases for early diagnosis and medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most current studies have focused on exploring how phagocyte internalization of drug-loaded nanovesicles by macrophages would affect the function and therapeutic effects of infiltrated neutrophils or monocytes, research has evaluated the specificity of the inhaled nanovesicles for targeting various phagocytes subpopulations. In this study, liposomes with various charges (including neutral (L1), anionic (L2), and cationic at inflammatory sites (L3)) were constructed to investigate how particle charge determined their interactions with key phagocytes (including macrophages and neutrophils) in acute lung injury (ALI) models and to establish correlations with their biofate and overall anti-inflammatory effect. Our results clearly indicated that neutrophils were capable of rapidly sequestering L3 with a 3.2-fold increase in the cellular liposome distribution, compared to that in AMs, while 70.5% of L2 were preferentially uptaken by alveolar macrophages (AMs). Furthermore, both AMs and the infiltrated neutrophils performed as the potential vesicles for the inhaled liposomes to prolong their lung retention in ALI models, whereas AMs function as sweepers to recognize and process liposomes in the healthy lung. Finally, inhaled roflumilast-loaded macrophage or neutrophil preferential liposomes (L2 or L3) exhibited optimal anti-inflammatory effect because of the decreased AMs phagocytic capacity or the prolonged circulation times of neutrophils. Such findings will be beneficial in exploiting a potential pathway to specifically manipulate lung phagocyte functions in lung inflammatory diseases where these cells play crucial roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. alleviate LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. protect mice by reducing pulmonary edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. inhibit the influx of inflammatory cells into the lung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. reduce inflammation in the lung by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common respiratory disease in clinics, which is characterized by alveolar-capillary membrane loss, plasma protein leakage, pulmonary edema, massive neutrophil infiltration, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators. Rhodiola rosea L. an adaptogenic plant rich in phenylethanoloids, phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. We hope to verify the relieving effect of total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. (RTG) on ALI in mice and clarify its mechanism through this study. In this study, we identified the effect and mechanism of RTG on ALI through LPS-induced ALI mice. After RTG treatment, the pathological structure of lung tissue in ALI mice induced by LPS was significantly improved, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells was reduced. In addition, RTG reduced the production of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the serum of ALI mice and reduced the content or activity of MPO, T-SOD, GSH, and MDA in lung tissue. RNAseq analysis showed that RTG ameliorated LPS-induced ALI through anti-inflammatory, reduced immune response, and anti-apoptotic activities. The western blotting analysis confirmed that RTG could down-regulate the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB p65, and p-IκBα/IκBα. These results suggest that RTG can attenuate LPS-induced ALI through antioxidants and inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD-L1 upregulation promotes drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting vimentin degradation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36586643/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with high mortality and limited therapeutic options. The immune checkpoint PD1/PD-L1 axis is related to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, and upregulated expression levels of PD-L1 have been demonstrated in IPF patients. However, the mechanism of PD-L1 in pulmonary fibrosis is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated upregulated expression of PD-L1 in fibrotic lung tissues and sera of IPF patients. Bleomycin (BLM) treatment induced PD-L1 upregulation, EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition) and fibrosis-like morphology changes in human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiCs). Silencing PD-L1 attenuated BLM-induced EMT and fibrosis-like morphology changes in HPAEpiCs. In addition, we identified that PD-L1 directly binds to vimentin and inhibits vimentin ubiquitination, thereby increasing vimentin levels in HPAEpiCs. Silencing of vimentin inhibited BLM- and PD-L1-induced fibrosis in HPAEpiCs. The correlation between PD-L1 and EMT or vimentin expression was further confirmed in clinical samples and animal models. Finally, we used BLM- and paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis animal models to confirm the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects of PD-L1 silencing. Taken together, our findings suggest that upregulated PD-L1 stimulates EMT of alveolar epithelial cells by increasing vimentin levels by inhibiting vimentin ubiquitination, thereby contributing to pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Targeting the limitation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) application in vivo, self-assembled AMPs library with specific nanostructures is expected to gradually overtake monomer AMPs libraries in the future. Peptide polymers are fascinating self-assembling nanoscale structures that have great advantage in biomedical applications because of their satisfactory biocompatibility and versatile properties. Herein, we describe a strategy for inducing the self-assembly of T9W into nanostructured antimicrobial micelles with evidently improved pharmacological properties, that is, PEGylation at the C-terminal of T9W (CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt;), an antibacterial biomaterial that self-assembles in aqueous media without exogenous excipients, has been developed. Compared with parental molecular, the CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; is more effective against &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, and its antibacterial spectrum had also been broadened. Additionally, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles had higher stability under salt ion, serum, and acid-base environments. Importantly, the self-assembled structure is highly resistant to trypsin degradation, probably allowing T9W to be applied in clinical settings in the future. Mechanistically, by acting on membranes and through supplementary bactericidal mechanisms, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles contribute to the antibacterial process. Collectively, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles exhibited good biocompatibility &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, resulting in highly effective treatment in a mouse acute lung injury model induced by &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 without drug resistance. These advances may profoundly accelerate the clinical transformation of T9W and promote the development of a combination of peptide-based antibiotics and PEGylated nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-33-ST2 pathway regulates AECII transdifferentiation by targeting alveolar macrophage in a bronchopulmonary dysplasia mouse model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36573439/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence points to the indispensable function of alveolar macrophages (AMs) in normal lung development and tissue homeostasis. However, the importance of AMs in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not been elucidated. Here, we identified a significant role of abnormal AM proliferation and polarization in alveolar dysplasia during BPD, which is closely related to the activation of the IL-33-ST2 pathway. Compared with the control BPD group, AMs depletion partially abolished the epithelialmesenchymal transition process of AECII and alleviated pulmonary differentiation arrest. In addition, IL-33 or ST2 knockdown has protective effects against lung injury after hyperoxia, which is associated with reduced AM polarization and proliferation. The protective effect disappeared following reconstitution of AMs in injured IL-33 knockdown mice, and the differentiation of lung epithelium was blocked again. In conclusion, the IL-33-ST2 pathway regulates AECII transdifferentiation by targeting AMs proliferation and polarization in BPD, which shows a novel strategy for manipulating the IL-33-ST2-AMs axis for the diagnosis and intervention of BPD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung injury is induced by abrupt increase in respiratory rate but prevented by recruitment maneuver in mild acute respiratory distress syndrome in rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36571572/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Gradually changing respiratory rate (RR) over time to reduce ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) has not been investigated. We hypothesized that gradual, compared to abrupt, increments in RR would mitigate VILI and that recruitment maneuver (RM) prior to abrupt increasing RR may prevent injurious biological impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Twenty-four hours after intratracheal administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, 49 male Wistar rats were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated (VT=6ml/kg, PEEP=3cmH2O) with RR increase patterns as follows (n=7/group): (1)control-1, RR=70bpm for 2h; (2) and (3)abrupt increases of RR for 1h and 2h, respectively, both for 2h; (4)shorter RR adaptation, gradually increasing RR (from 70 to 130bpm over 30min); (5)longer RR adaptation, more gradual increase in RR (from 70 to 130bpm over 60min), both for 2h; (6)control-2, abrupt increase of RR maintained for 1h; and (7)control-3, RM [CPAP=30cmH2O for 30s] followed by control-2 protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; At the end of 1h of mechanical ventilation, cumulative diffuse alveolar damage scores were lower in shorter (11.0 [8.0-12.0]) and longer (13.0 [11.0-14.0]) RR adaptation groups than in animals with abrupt increase of RR for 1 h (25.0 [22.0-26.0] p=0.035, and p=0.048, respectively) and 2 h (35.0 [32.0-39.0], p=0.003, and p=0.040, respectively); mechanical power and lung heterogeneity were lower, and alveolar integrity was higher, in the longer RR adaptation group compared with abruptly adjusted groups; markers of lung inflammation (IL-6), epithelial (CC-16) and endothelial cell damage (VCAM-1) were higher in both abrupt groups, but not in either RR adaptation group, compared with controls. RM prevented the increase in VCAM-1 and CC-16 gene expressions in the abruptly increased RR groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In mild experimental ARDS in rats, gradually increasing RR, compared with abruptly doing so, can mitigate the development of VILI. In addition, recruitment maneuver prevented the injurious biological impact of abrupt increases in RR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 15-30% of patients are likely to develop COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are still few effective and well-understood therapies available. Novel variants and short-lasting immunity are posing challenges to vaccine efficacy, so finding antiviral and antiinflammatory treatments remains crucial. Here, tripterin (TP), a traditional Chinese medicine, was encapsulated into liposome (TP lipo) to investigate its antiviral and antiinflammatory effects in severe COVID-19. By using two severe COVID-19 models in human ACE2-transgenic (hACE2) mice, an analysis of TP lipo&amp;rsquo;s effects on pulmonary immune responses was conducted. Pulmonary pathological alterations and viral burden were reduced by TP lipo treatment. TP lipo inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication and hyperinflammation in infected cells and mice, two crucial events in severe COVID-19 pathophysiology, it is a promising drug candidate to treat SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UHRF1-mediated ferroptosis promotes pulmonary fibrosis via epigenetic repression of GPX4 and FSP1 genes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36566325/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis (PF), as an end-stage clinical phenotype of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), is frequently initiated after alveolar injury, in which ferroptosis has been identified as a critical event aggravating the pathophysiological progression of this disease. Here in, a comprehensive analysis of two mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis developed in our lab demonstrated that lung damage-induced ferroptosis of alveolar epithelial Type2 cells (AEC2) significantly accumulates during the development of pulmonary fibrosis while ferroptosis suppressor genes GPX4 and FSP1 are dramatically inactivated. Mechanistically, upregulation of de novo methylation regulator Uhrf1 sensitively elevates CpG site methylation levels in promoters of both GPX4 and FSP1 genes and induces the epigenetic repression of both genes, subsequently leading to ferroptosis in chemically interfered AEC2 cells. Meanwhile, specific inhibition of UHRF1 highly arrests the ferroptosis formation and blocks the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in both of our research models. This study first, to our knowledge, identified the involvement of Uhrf1 in mediating the ferroptosis of chemically injured AEC2s via de novo promoter-specific methylation of both GPX4 and FSP1 genes, which consequently accelerates the process of pulmonary fibrosis. The above findings also strongly suggested Uhrf1 as a novel potential target in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiota modulates lung fibrosis severity following acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36543914/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent studies demonstrate the significance of gut microbiota on the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases; yet little is known regarding the role of the gut microbiota in lung fibrosis progression. Here we show, using the bleomycin murine model to quantify lung fibrosis in C57BL/6 J mice housed in germ-free, animal biosafety level 1 (ABSL-1), or animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL-2) environments, that germ-free mice are protected from lung fibrosis, while ABSL-1 and ABSL-2 mice develop mild and severe lung fibrosis, respectively. Metagenomic analysis reveals no notable distinctions between ABSL-1 and ABSL-2 lung microbiota, whereas greater microbial diversity, with increased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacilli, is present in ABSL-1 compared to ABSL-2 gut microbiota. Flow cytometric analysis reveals enhanced IL-6/STAT3/IL-17A signaling in pulmonary CD4 + T cells of ABSL-2 mice. Fecal transplantation of ABSL-2 stool into germ-free mice recapitulated more severe fibrosis than transplantation of ABSL-1 stool. Lactobacilli supernatant reduces collagen 1 A production in IL-17A- and TGFβ1-stimulated human lung fibroblasts. These findings support a functional role of the gut microbiota in augmenting lung fibrosis severity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A spatially resolved atlas of the human lung characterizes a gland-associated immune niche</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-cell transcriptomics has allowed unprecedented resolution of cell types/states in the human lung, but their spatial context is less well defined. To (re)define tissue architecture of lung and airways, we profiled five proximal-to-distal locations of healthy human lungs in depth using multi-omic single cell/nuclei and spatial transcriptomics at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lungcellatlas.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lung Cell Atlas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Using computational data integration and analysis, we extend beyond the suspension cell paradigm and discover macro and micro-anatomical tissue compartments including previously unannotated cell types in the epithelial, vascular, stromal and nerve bundle micro-environments. We identify and implicate peribronchial fibroblasts in lung disease. Importantly, we discover and validate a survival niche for IgA plasma cells in the airway submucosal glands (SMG). We show that gland epithelial cells recruit B cells and IgA plasma cells, and promote longevity and antibody secretion locally through expression of CCL28, APRIL and IL-6. This new ‘gland-associated immune niche’ has implications for respiratory health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BAP31 regulates the expression of ICAM-1/VCAM-1 via MyD88/NF-κB pathway in acute lung injury mice model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549351/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; The cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that mediate neutrophil-endothelium cell adhesion are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). B-cell receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31) has been reported to engage in the expression of some CAMs. This study was undertaken to explore whether BAP31 in endotheliocyte affects the pathological process of ALI by regulating CAMs, and its possible mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; Our study used the shBAP31 endothelium cell lines and endothelial-specific BAP31 conditional knockdown mice constructed via Cre/loxP system. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the histopathological manifestations. The adhesion of neutrophils to vascular wall was examined by intravital microscopy. The nuclear translocation of NF-κB was observed by immunofluorescence staining assay. Flow cytometric, real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assay were performed to determine the expression of CAMs and key proteins in MyD88/NF-κB-related signaling pathway. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were analyzed for transcriptional activity of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; Mechanistic investigations indicated that endothelium-specific BAP31 depletion dramatically reduced the capacity of neutrophils adherence to endothelial cells (ECs), which was mainly attributed to the significant downregulation of ICAM-1 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and VCAM-1 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) expression. Interestingly, BAP31 knockdown apparently deactivated MyD88/TRAF6-mediated TAK1/NF-κB and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades, resulting in the inhibition of NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; Our data furnished convincing evidence that BAP31 deficiency performs a mitigative effect on ALI by decreasing neutrophils-ECs adhesion. These findings identified BAP31 as a promising protein for regulating the pathogenesis process of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging roles of mechanosensitive ion channels in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36539808/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a devastating respiratory disorder with high rates of mortality and morbidity, but the detailed underlying mechanisms of ALI/ARDS remain largely unknown. Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), including epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Piezo channels, transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), and two-pore domain potassium ion (K2P) channels, are highly expressed in lung tissues, and the activity of these MSCs can be modulated by mechanical forces (e.g., mechanical ventilation) and other stimuli (e.g., LPS, hyperoxia). Dysfunction of MSCs has been found in various types of ALI/ARDS, and MSCs play a key role in regulating alveolar fluid clearance, alveolar epithelial/endothelial barrier function, the inflammatory response and surfactant secretion in ALI/ARDS lungs. Targeting MSCs exerts therapeutic effects in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. In this review, we summarize the structure and functions of several well-recognized MSCs, the role of MSCs in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and recent advances in the pharmacological and molecular modulation of MSCs in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. According to the current literature, targeting MSCs might be a very promising therapeutic approach against ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PI3K/AKT-mediated autophagy inhibition facilitates mast cell activation to enhance severe inflammatory lung injury in influenza A virus- and secondary Staphylococcus aureus-infected mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549394/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality each year globally, and secondary bacterial infection further exacerbates the severity and fatality of the initial viral infection. Mast cells have substantial roles in protecting the respiratory tract mucosa, while their role in viral and bacterial co-infection remains unclear. The present study revealed that secondary Staphylococcus aureus infection significantly aggravated the activation of mast cells during the initial H1N1 infection both in vivo and in vitro, which was closely related to the increased inflammatory lung injury and mortality. Meanwhile, the secondary S. aureus infection suppressed autophagy and promoted inflammatory mediators released by mast cells through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Blocking PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation, could rescue autophagy and inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, based on the influenza A viral and secondary bacterial infected mice model, we showed that the combination of LY294002 and antiviral drug oseltamivir could effectively reduce the inflammatory damage and pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing in lungs, recovering body weight loss and improving the survival rate from the co-infections. In conclusion, secondary bacterial infection can inhibit autophagy and stimulate mast cell activation through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which might explain why secondary bacterial infection would cause severe and fatal consequences following an initial influenza A viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inappropriate accumulation of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and subsequent excessive production of immune responses play critical roles in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI), but the core negative regulators governing innate signalling in AMs are ill defined. We have previously shown that single immunoglobin IL-1 receptor-related protein (SIGIRR), a negative regulator of IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor signalling, inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in AMs. To address the biological relevance of SIGIRR in vivo, we generated a murine ALI model via intratracheal instillation of LPS. Intriguingly, SIGIRR expression was observed to be decreased in resident and recruited macrophages during ALI. This decrease was associated with parallel induction in CD18 protein levels in LPS-challenged lung tissues. Through intranasal injection of SIGIRR lentiviral particles studies, we showed that the overexpression of SIGIRR attenuated recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils, decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and ameliorated pathological changes in lungs. Whilst exploring the basis for this phenotype, SIGIRR was found to be coexpressed with CD18 in AMs, and SIGIRR potentiated the instability of CD18 protein via enhancement of its ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Conversely, by using CD18-/- mice, we further observed that CD18 deletion completely abolished the therapeutic effects of overexpression of SIGIRR on LPS-induced ALI. Mover, overexpression of CD18 in AMs promoted adhesion to ECM components, enhanced TLR4-mediated inflammasome activation and thereby potentiated IL-1β production. These data collectively identify SIGIRR/CD18 as a key negative regulatory circuit maintaining innate immune homeostasis in AMs along the pathogenesis of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alveolar macrophages instruct CD8&#43; T cell expansion by antigen cross-presentation in lung</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; memory T cells play central roles in protective immunity to respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus (IAV). Here, we find that alveolar macrophages (AMs) function as antigen-presenting cells that support the expansion of lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; memory T cells. Intranasal antigen administration to mice subcutaneously immunized with antigen results in a rapid expansion of antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the lung, which is dependent on antigen cross-presentation by AMs. AMs highly express interleukin-18 (IL-18), which mediates subsequent formation of CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; resident memory T (T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;) cells in the lung. In a mouse model of IAV infection, AMs are required for expansion of virus-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells and inhibiting virus replication in the lungs during secondary infection. These results suggest that AMs instruct a rapid expansion of antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in lung, which protect the host from respiratory virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Locally organised and activated Fth1hi neutrophils aggravate inflammation of acute lung injury in an IL-10-dependent manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36513690/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common respiratory critical syndrome with no effective therapeutic intervention. Neutrophils function in the overwhelming inflammatory process of acute lung injury (ALI) caused by ARDS; however, the phenotypic heterogeneity of pulmonary neutrophils in ALI/ARDS remains largely unknown. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify two transcriptionally and functionally heterogeneous neutrophil populations (Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu and Prok2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu) with distinct locations in LPS-induced ALI mouse lungs. Exposure to LPS promotes the Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu subtype, with more inflammatory factors, stronger antioxidant, and decreased apoptosis under the regulation of interleukin-10. Furthermore, prolonged retention of Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu within lung tissue aggravates inflammatory injury throughout the development of ALI/ARDS. Notably, ARDS patients have high ratios of Fth1 to Prok2 expression in pulmonary neutrophils, suggesting that the Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu population may promote the pathological development and provide a marker of poor outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maturation and specialization of group 2 innate lymphoid cells through the lung-gut axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are abundant in mucosal tissues. They serve critical functions in anti-pathogen response and tissue homeostasis. However, the heterogenous composition of ILCs in mucosal sites and their various maturation trajectories are less well known. In this study, we characterize ILC types and functions from both the lung and the small intestine, and identify their tissue-specific markers. We find that ILC2s residing in the lung express CCR2, whereas intestinal ILC2s express CCR4. Through the use of CCR2 and CCR4 reporter mice, we show that ILC2s undergo translocation via the lung-gut axis upon IL-33 treatment. This trajectory of ILC2s is also observed at the postnatal stage. Allergen-induced activation of lung ILC2s affects the homeostasis of gut ILC2s. Together, our findings implicate that ILCs display tissue-specific features in both the lung and gut, and ILC2s mature along the lung-gut axis in particular homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a multiomic cell atlas of human lung development that combines single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing, high-throughput spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell imaging. Coupling single-cell methods with spatial analysis has allowed a comprehensive cellular survey of the epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial, and erythrocyte/leukocyte compartments from 5–22 post-conception weeks. We identify previously uncharacterized cell states in all compartments. These include developmental-specific secretory progenitors and a subtype of neuroendocrine cell related to human small cell lung cancer. Our datasets are available through our web interface (&lt;a href=&#34;https://lungcellatlas.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://lungcellatlas.org&lt;/a&gt;). To illustrate its general utility, we use our cell atlas to generate predictions about cell-cell signaling and transcription factor hierarchies which we rigorously test using organoid models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel FOXF1-Stabilizing Compound TanFe Stimulates Lung Angiogenesis in Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36480964/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACDMPV) is linked to heterozygous mutations in the FOXF1 gene, a key transcriptional regulator of pulmonary vascular development. There are no effective treatments for ACDMPV other than lung transplant, and new pharmacological agents activating FOXF1 signaling are urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Identify small molecule compounds that stimulate FOXF1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitation, and the in vitro ubiquitination assay to identify TanFe, a small molecule compound from the nitrile group, which stabilizes the FOXF1 protein in the cell. The efficacy of TanFe was tested in mouse models of ACDMPV and Acute Lung Injury and in human vascular organoids derived from iPSCs of ACDMPV patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and main results:&lt;/em&gt; We identified HECTD1 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in ubiquitination and degradation of the FOXF1 protein. The TanFe compound disrupted FOXF1-HECTD1 protein-protein interactions and decreased ubiquitination of the FOXF1 protein in pulmonary endothelial cells in vitro. TanFe increased protein levels of FOXF1 and its target genes Flk1, Flt1 and Cdh5 in LPS-injured mouse lungs, decreasing endothelial permeability and inhibiting lung inflammation. Treatment of pregnant mice with TanFe increased FOXF1 protein levels in lungs of Foxf1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; embryos, stimulated neonatal lung angiogenesis, and completely prevented the mortality of Foxf1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice after birth. TanFe increased angiogenesis in human vascular organoids derived from iPSCs of ACDMPV patient with FOXF1 deletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; TanFe is a novel activator of FOXF1, providing a new therapeutic candidate for treatment of ACDMPV and other neonatal pulmonary vascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Suppression of PD-L1 release from small extracellular vesicles promotes systemic anti-tumor immunity by targeting ORAI1 calcium channels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36482876/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockade of immune checkpoints as a strategy of cancer cells to overcome the immune response has received ample attention in cancer research recently. In particular, expression of PD-L1 by various cancer cells has become a paradigm in this respect. Delivery of PD-L1 to its site of action occurs either by local diffusion, or else by transport via small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, commonly referred to as exosomes). Many steps of sEVs formation, their packaging with PD-L1 and their release into the extracellular space have been studied in detail. The likely dependence of release on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signaling, however, has received little attention. This is surprising, since the intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-concentration is known as a prominent regulator of many secretory processes. Here, we report on the roles of three Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent proteins in regulating release of PD-L1-containing sEVs, as well as on the growth of tumors in mouse models. We show that sEVs release in cancer cell lines is Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent and the knockdown of the gene coding the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel protein ORAI1 reduces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signals and release of sEVs. Consequently, the T cell response is reinvigorated and tumor progression in mouse models is retarded. Furthermore, analysis of protein expression patterns in samples from human cancer tissue shows that the ORAI1 gene is significantly upregulated. Such upregulation is identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor for survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We show that reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signaling after knockdown of ORAI1 gene also compromises the activity of melanophilin and Synaptotagmin-like protein 2, two proteins, which are important for correct localization of secretory organelles within cancer cells and their transport to sites of exocytosis. Thus, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel ORAI1 and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent proteins of the secretion pathway emerge as important targets for understanding and manipulating immune checkpoint blockade by PD-L1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery of a pyrano[2,3-b]pyridine derivative YX-2102 as a cannabinoid receptor 2 agonist for alleviating lung fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36474298/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pharmacological modulation of cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) is a promising therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Thus, to develop CB2R selective ligands with new chemical space has attracted much research interests. This work aims to discover a novel CB2R agonist from an in-house library, and to evaluate its therapeutic effects on PF model, as well as to disclose the pharmacological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Virtual screening was used to identify the candidate ligand for CB2R from a newly established in-house library. Both in vivo experiments on PF rat model and in vitro experiments on cells were performed to investigate the therapeutic effects of the lead compound and underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A &amp;ldquo;natural product-like&amp;rdquo; pyrano[2,3-b]pyridine derivative, YX-2102 was identified that bound to CB2R with high affinity. Intraperitoneal YX-2102 injections significantly ameliorated lung injury, inflammation and fibrosis in a rat model of PF induced by bleomycin (BLM). On one hand, YX-2102 inhibited inflammatory response at least partially through modulating macrophages polarization thereby exerting protective effects. Whereas, on the other hand, YX-2102 significantly upregulated CB2R expression in alveolar epithelial cells in vivo. Its pretreatment inhibited lung alveolar epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and PF model induced by transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) via a CB2 receptor-dependent pathway. Further studies suggested that the Nrf2-Smad7 pathway might be involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These findings suggest that CB2R is a potential target for PF treatment and YX-2102 is a promising CB2R agonist with new chemical space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lipid-laden lung mesenchymal cells foster breast cancer metastasis via metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells and natural killer cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36476935/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lung mesenchymal cells (MCs) store neutral lipids during breast cancer progression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-1β elicits neutral lipid accumulation in lung MCs to foster metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lipid-laden MCs metabolically reprogram both tumor cells and NK cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting lipid-laden MCs improves the efficacy of NK cell-based immunotherapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the distant organ environment is known to support metastasis of primary tumors, its metabolic roles in this process remain underdetermined. Here, in breast cancer models, we found lung-resident mesenchymal cells (MCs) accumulating neutral lipids at the pre-metastatic stage. This was partially mediated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (HILPDA) that subsequently represses adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) activity in lung MCs. MC-specific ablation of the ATGL or HILPDA genes in mice reinforced and reduced lung metastasis of breast cancer respectively, suggesting a metastasis-promoting effect of lipid-laden MCs. Mechanistically, lipid-laden MCs transported their lipids to tumor cells and natural killer (NK) cells via exosome-like vesicles, leading to heightened tumor cell survival and proliferation and NK cell dysfunction. Blockage of IL-1β, which was effective singly, improved the efficacy of adoptive NK cell immunotherapy in mitigating lung metastasis. Collectively, lung MCs metabolically regulate tumor cells and anti-tumor immunity to facilitate breast cancer lung metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Necroptosis signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome cross-talking in epithelium facilitate Pseudomonas aeruginosa mediated lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36470578/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, although there is an amount of research just focus on ALI/ ARDS pathophysiological analysis, the development of therapies based on specific molecular targets are still lacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-talking between necroptosis and inflammasome in epithelium promotes pathological damage of ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROS inhibitor Mito-TEMPO blocks inflammasome to alleviate inflammation of ALI, which could be a potential therapeutic target for acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced acute lung injury is such a serious risk to public health, but the pathological regulation remains unclear. Here, we reported that PA mediated epithelial necroptosis plays an important role in pathological process. Pharmacological and genomic ablation of necroptosis signaling ameliorate PA mediated ALI and pulmonary inflammation. Our results further proved NLRP3 inflammasome to involve in the process. Mechanism investigation revealed the cross-talking between inflammasome activation and necroptosis that MLKL-dependent necroptosis signaling promotes the change of mitochondrial membrane potential for the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is the important trigger for functional inflammasome activation. Furthermore, antioxidants such as Mito-TEMPO was confirmed to significantly restrain inflammasome activation in epithelium, resulting in a reduction in PA induced pulmonary inflammation. Taken together, our findings revealed that necroptosis-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome in epithelium plays a crucial role in PA mediated injury, which could be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protection of adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells during acute lung injury requires autophagy maintained by mTOR</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells may represent a promising cellular therapy for acute lung injury (ALI); however, the underlying relevant molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) were isolated and characterized by alizarin red staining, oil red staining, and flow cytometry. Lung injury and inflammatory cell infiltration were determined using the Evans blue method, wet/dry weight ratio, and H&amp;amp;E staining. An ELISA was used to detect the concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α. Autophagy was detected with an mRFP-GFP-LC3 dual-fluorescence autophagy indicator system, Western blotting, and electron microscopy. We first demonstrated that ADSCs did alleviate the inflammatory responses and tissue damage in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Next, we further demonstrated in vivo that autophagy plays a key role in the maintenance of ADSC therapeutic efficacy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ADSCs co-cultured with alveolar epithelial cells depend on autophagy for significant anti-inflammatory functions. Moreover, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of autophagy. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of ADSC on ALI, especially on alveolar epithelial cells, is dependent on mTOR-mediated autophagy maintenance. The significance of our study for ALI therapy is discussed with respect to a more complete understanding of the therapeutic strategy paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PSMA2 knockdown impacts expression of proteins involved in immune and cellular stress responses in human lung cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36481484/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Highlights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSMA2, a critical component of the 20S and 26S proteasome, is involved in key cellular functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOMAscan analysis identified many lung cell proteins either up- or down-regulated by PSMA2 knockdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSMA2 knockdown affected proteins involved in immune response, cytokine signaling, cellular stress and injury, and cancer responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteasome subunit alpha type-2 (PSMA2) is a critical component of the 20S proteasome, which is the core particle of the 26S proteasome complex and is involved in cellular protein quality control by recognizing and recycling defective proteins. PSMA2 expression dysregulation has been detected in different human diseases and viral infections. No study yet has reported PSMA2 knockdown (KD) effects on the cellular proteome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used SOMAScan, an aptamer-based multiplexed technique, to measure &amp;gt;1300 human proteins to determine the impact of PSMA2 KD on A549 human lung epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; PSMA2 KD resulted in significant dysregulation of 52 cellular proteins involved in different bio-functions, including cellular movement and development, cell death and survival, and cancer. The immune system and signal transduction were the most affected cellular functions. PSMA2 KD caused dysregulation of several signaling pathways involved in immune response, cytokine signaling, organismal growth and development, cellular stress and injury (including autophagy and unfolded protein response), and cancer responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, this study helps us better understand the importance of PSMA2 in different cellular functions, signaling pathways, and human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sacubitril/valsartan alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting GSDMD-dependent macrophage pyroptosis in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36471663/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disorder with intricate pathogenesis. Macrophage pyroptosis reportedly plays a vital role in ALI. Although it has been established that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can reduce sepsis-induced organ injury, the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan (SV) for sepsis has been largely understudied. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of SV in sepsis-induced ALI. Caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) were used to induce polymicrobial sepsis and related ALI. The therapeutic effects of SV in CLP mice were subsequently assessed. Gasdermin D (GSDMD)&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice were used to validate the signalling pathways affected by SV. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and Raw264.7 cells were treated with SV following exposure to lipopolysaccharide and adenosine triphosphate. Finally, the serum obtained from 42 septic patients was used for biochemical analysis. Compared to the other ARBs, SV yielded more pronounced anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, SV decreased mortality rates, significantly reduced lung damage and prevented the inflammatory response in CLP mice. In addition, SV suppressed GSDMD-mediated macrophage pyroptosis in mice. In BMDMs and Raw264.7 cells, the anti-inflammatory and anti-pyroptosis properties of SV were verified. SV treatment effectively inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and prevented macrophage pyroptosis in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that septic individuals had considerably higher serum angiotensin II levels. Overall, we found that SV might prevent ALI in CLP mice by inhibiting GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis of macrophages. Thus, SV might be a viable drug for sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of cannabinoid-2 receptor protects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced acute lung injury and inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463179/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Bacterial pneumonia is a major risk factor for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; (PA), an opportunistic pathogen with an increasing resistance acquired against multiple drugs, is one of the main causative agents of ALI and ARDS in diverse clinical settings. Given the anti-inflammatory role of the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2R), the effect of CB2R activation in the regulation of PA-induced ALI and inflammation was tested in a mouse model as an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In order to activate CB2R, a selective synthetic agonist, JWH133, was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, SR144528 (a selective CB2R antagonist) was administered in combination with JWH133 to test the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effect. PA was administered intratracheally (i.t.) for induction of pneumonia in mice. At 24 h after PA exposure, lung mechanics were measured using the FlexiVent system. The total cell number, protein content, and neutrophil population in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. The bacterial load in the whole lung was also measured. Lung injury was evaluated by histological examination and PA-induced inflammation was assessed by measuring the levels of BALF cytokines and chemokines. Neutrophil activation (examined by immunofluorescence and immunoblot) and PA-induced inflammatory signaling (analyzed by immunoblot) were also studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CB2R activation by JWH133 was found to significantly reduce PA-induced ALI and the bacterial burden. CB2R activation also suppressed the PA-induced increase in immune cell infiltration, neutrophil population, and inflammatory cytokines. These effects were abrogated by a CB2R antagonist, SR144528, further confirming the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effects. CB2R-knock out (CB2RKO) mice had a significantly higher level of PA-induced inflammation as compared to that in WT mice. CB2R activation diminished the excess activation of neutrophils, whereas mice lacking CB2R had elevated neutrophil activation. Pharmacological activation of CB2R significantly reduced the PA-induced NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, whereas CB2KO mice had elevated NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings indicate that CB2R activation ameliorates PA-induced lung injury and inflammation, thus paving the path for new therapeutic avenues against PA pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JMJD3 Is Required for Acute Pancreatitis and Pancreatitis-Associated Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36458991/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be complicated by inflammatory disorders of remote organs, such as lung injury, in which Jumonji domain-containing protein 3 (JMJD3) plays a vital role in proinflammatory responses. Currently, we found that JMJD3 expression was upregulated in the pancreas and lung in an AP male mouse model, which was also confirmed in AP patients. Further experiments revealed that the upregulation of JMJD3 and proinflammatory effects were possibly exerted by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or oxidized-mtDNA from tissue injury caused by AP. The release of mtDNA and oxidized-mtDNA contributed to the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes in lung injury through the stimulator of IFN genes (STING)/TLR9-NF-κB-JMJD3-TNF-α pathway. The inhibition of JMJD3 or utilization of Jmjd3-cKO mice significantly alleviated pulmonary inflammation induced by AP. Blocking mtDNA oxidation or knocking down the TLR9/STING pathway effectively alleviated inflammation. Therefore, inhibition of JMJD3 or STING/TLR9 pathway blockage might be a potential therapeutic strategy to treat AP and the associated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>H3K27 tri-demethylase JMJD3 inhibits macrophage apoptosis by promoting ADORA2A in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36456564/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common critical disease, which is characterized by an uncontrolled, acute inflammatory response, diffuse lung damage and ultimately directly deteriorates into acute respiratory distress syndrome. The number of pro-inflammatory macrophages is related to the severity of ALI. Up-regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophage apoptosis can reduce the pro-inflammatory reactions. Jumonji domain-containing protein D3 (JMJD3)-mediated histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) demethylation may promote the pro-inflammatory response of macrophages under LPS stimulation. However, the mechanism of JMJD3 affecting macrophage apoptosis is still not clear. To explore this gap in knowledge, the ALI mice model with intratracheal administration of LPS and RAW264.7 cells with LPS stimulation were used as in vivo and in vitro experiments. The expression of JMJD3 and H3K27me3 and their cellular localization were analysed in lung tissue. Apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL staining and flow cytometry. Expression of H3K27me3, ADORA2A and C/EBPβ were compared among different treatments and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to investigate the regulatory relationship. Our study showed that JMJD3 expression was upregulated in LPS-induced ALI mice and RAW264.7 cells. JMJD3-indued H3K27me3 demethylation inhibited caspase-3 cleavage by upregulating ADORA2A to decrease LPS-stimulated macrophage apoptosis and promoted the inflammatory reaction. This H3K27me3 demethylation also increased C/EBPβ expression, which may enhance ADORA2A expression further. Besides, inhibiting ADORA2A can also promote LPS-limited macrophage apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of JMJD3 in vivo and in vitro relieved the inhibition of macrophage apoptosis thus leading to the resolution of the inflammation. JMJD3 might inhibit macrophage apoptosis by promoting ADORA2A expression in LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simultaneous isolation of proximal and distal lung progenitor cells from individual mice using a 3D printed guide reduces proximal cell contamination of distal lung epithelial cell isolations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36460000/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3DLD reproducibly separates lung lobes and extrapulmonary airways (bronchi/trachea)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3DLD cell isolation yields consistent isolation of distal epithelial cells (DECs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contamination of proximal cells in classic DEC isolations may alter &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3DLD allows simultaneous isolation of proximal and DECs from single animals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The respiratory epithelium consists of multiple, functionally distinct cell types and is maintained by regionally specific progenitor populations that repair the epithelium following injury. Several &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; methods exist for studying lung epithelial repair using primary murine lung cells, but isolation methods are hampered by a lack of surface markers distinguishing epithelial progenitors along the respiratory epithelium. Here, we developed a 3D printed lobe divider (3DLD) to aid in simultaneous isolation of proximal versus distal lung epithelial progenitors from individual mice that give rise to differentiated epithelia in multiple &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; assays. In contrast to 3DLD-isolated distal progenitor cells, commonly used manual tracheal ligation methods followed by lobe removal resulted in co-isolation of rare proximal cells with distal cells, which altered the transcriptional landscape and size distribution of distal organoids. The 3DLD aids in reproducible isolation of distal versus proximal progenitor populations and minimizes the potential for contaminating populations to confound &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; assays.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFIH1/IRF1/STAT1 promotes sepsis associated inflammatory lung injury via activating macrophage M1 polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36462334/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36462334/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIH1 is activated by infection, which triggers the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor IRF1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRF1 then attaches to the STAT1 promoter region to initiate the transcription of STAT1 and polarization of macrophage M1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRF1 has been identified as the essential molecule that controls the macrophage M1 polarization and the onset of septic ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research has shown that the phenotypic change in macrophages from M0 to M1 is essential for the start of the inflammatory process in septic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Potential treatment targets might be identified with more knowledge of the molecular regulation of M1 macrophages in septic ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-microarray interrelated analysis of high-throughput experiments from ARDS patients and macrophage polarization was conducted to identify the hub genes associated with macrophage M1 polarization and septic ARDS. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Poly (I:C) were utilized to stimulate bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) for M1-polarized macrophage model construction. Knock down of the hub genes on BMDMs via shRNAs was used to screen the genes regulating macrophage M1 polarization in vitro. The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model was constructed in knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice to explore whether the screened genes regulate macrophage M1 polarization in septic ARDS in vivo. ChIP-seq and further experiments on BMDMs were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bioinformatics analysis of gene expression profiles from a clinical cohort of 26 ARDS patients and macrophage polarization found that the 5 hub genes (IFIH1, IRF1, STAT1, IFIT3, GBP1) may have a synergistic effect on macrophage M1 polarization in septic ARDS. Further in vivo investigations indicated that IFIH1, STAT1 and IRF1 contribute to macrophage M1 polarization. The histological evaluation and immunohistochemistry of the lungs from the IRF1-/- and WT mice indicated that knockout of IRF1 markedly alleviated CLP-induced lung injury and M1-polarized infiltration. Moreover, the molecular mechanism investigations indicated that knockdown of IFIH1 markedly promoted IRF1 translocation into the nucleus. Knockout of IRF1 significantly decreases the expression of STAT1. ChIP-seq and PCR further confirmed that IRF1, as a transcription factor of STAT1, binds to the promoter region of STAT1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRF1 was identified as the key molecule that regulates macrophage M1polarization and septic ARDS development in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, as the adaptor in response to infection mimics irritants, IFIH1 promotes IRF1 (transcription factor) translocation into the nucleus to initiate STAT1 transcription.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FGFR2b signalling restricts lineage-flexible alveolar progenitors during mouse lung development and converges in mature alveolar type 2 cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36445537/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specification, characterization, and fate of alveolar type 1 and type 2 (AT1 and AT2) progenitors during embryonic lung development are poorly defined. Current models of distal epithelial lineage formation fail to capture the heterogeneity and dynamic contribution of progenitor pools present during early development. Furthermore, few studies explore the pathways involved in alveolar progenitor specification and fate. In this paper, we build upon our previously published work on the regulation of airway epithelial progenitors by fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b) signalling during early (E12.5) and mid (E14.5) pseudoglandular stage lung development. Our results suggest that a significant proportion of AT2 and AT1 progenitors are lineage-flexible during late pseudoglandular stage development, and that lineage commitment is regulated in part by FGFR2b signalling. We have characterized a set of direct FGFR2b targets at E16.5 which are likely involved in alveolar lineage formation. These signature genes converge on a subpopulation of AT2 cells later in development and are downregulated in AT2 cells transitioning to the AT1 lineage during repair after injury in adults. Our findings highlight the extensive heterogeneity of pneumocytes by elucidating the role of FGFR2b signalling in these cells during early airway epithelial lineage formation, as well as during repair after injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chlorine (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas is a toxic industrial chemical (TIC) that poses a hazard to human health following accidental and/or intentional (e.g. terrorist) release. By using a murine model of sub-lethal Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposure we have examined the airway hyper responsiveness, cellular infiltrates, transcriptomic and proteomic responses of the lung. In the “crisis” phase at 2 h and 6 h there is a significant decreases in leukocytes within bronchoalveolar lavage fluid accompanied by an upregulation within the proteome of immune pathways ultimately resulting in neutrophil influx at 24 h. A flip towards “repair” in the transcriptome and proteome occurs at 24 h, neutrophil influx and an associated drop in the lung function persisting until 14 d post-exposure and subsequent “recovery” after 28 days. Collectively, this research provides new insights into the mechanisms of damage, early global responses and processes of repair induced in the lung following the inhalation of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhaled platelet vesicle-decoyed biomimetic nanoparticles attenuate inflammatory lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory response which causes serious damages to alveolar epithelia and vasculature, and it still remains high lethality and mortality with no effective treatment. Based on the inflammatory homing of platelets and cell membrane cloaking nanotechnology, in this study we developed a biomimetic anti-inflammation nanoparticle delivery system for ALI treatment. PM@Cur-RV NPs were designed by combining the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (NPs) coated with platelet membrane vesicles (PM) for the purpose of highly targeting delivery of curcumin (Cur) and resveratrol (RV) to inflammatory lungs. PM@Cur-RV NPs showed good biocompatibility and biosafety both in vitro and in vivo. Accumulation of NPs into lung tract was observed after inhaled NPs. Remarkably, the inhalation of PM@Cur-RV NPs effectively inhibited lung vascular injury evidenced by the decreased lung vascular permeability, and the reduced proinflammatory cytokine burden in an ALI mouse model. The analysis of infiltrated macrophages in the lungs showed that the Cur-RV-modulated macrophage polarized towards M2 phenotype and the decreased histone lactylation might contribute to their anti-inflammation effects. Together, this work highlights the potential of inhalation of biomimetic nanoparticle delivery of curcumin and resveratrol for the treatment of pulmonary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-199a-3p-regulated alveolar macrophage-derived secretory autophagosomes exacerbate lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36523634/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a prevalent illness in intensive care units. Extracellular vesicles and particles released from activated alveolar macrophages (AMs) assist in ARDS lung injury and the inflammatory process through mechanisms that are unclear. This study investigated the role of AM-derived secretory autophagosomes (SAPs) in lung injury and microRNA (MiR)-199a-3p-regulated inflammation associated with ARDS in vitro and in a murine model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The ARDS model in mouse was established by intratracheal LPS lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. The agomirs or antagomirs of MiR-199a-3p were injected into the caudal vein to figure out whether MiR-199a-3p could influence ARDS inflammation and lung injury, whereas the mimics or inhibitors of MiR-199a-3p, siRNA of Rab8a, or PAK4 inhibitor were transfected or applied to RAW264.7 cells to evaluate the mechanism of SAP release. Culture supernatants of RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice were collected for the isolation of SAPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that MiR-199a-3p was over-expressed in the lungs of ARDS mice. The MiR-199a-3p antagomir alleviated, whereas the MiR-199a-3p agomir exacerbated LPS-induced inflammation in mice by promoting AM-derived SAP secretion. In addition, MiR-199a-3p over-expression exacerbated LPS-induced ARDS via activating Rab8a, and Rab8a silencing significantly suppressed the promoting influence of the MiR-199a-3p mimic on SAP secretion. Furthermore, MiR-199a-3p mimic activated Rab8a by directly inhibiting PAK4 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The novel finding of this study is that MiR-199a-3p participated in the regulation of SAP secretion and the inflammatory process via targeting of PAK4/Rab8a, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for ARDS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amorphous silica nanoparticles caused lung injury through the induction of epithelial apoptosis via ROS/Ca2&#43;/DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36441139/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adverse effects of amorphous silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) exposure on the respiratory system were increasingly recognized, however, its potential pathogenesis still remains not fully elucidated. So, this study aimed to explore its effects on pulmonary injury, and to investigate related mechanisms. Histological investigations illustrated SiNPs triggered the lung injury, mainly manifested as alveolar structure destruction, collagen deposition, and mitochondrial ultrastructural injury. In particular, SiNPs greatly enhanced pulmonary ROS and TUNEL positive rate in lungs, both of which were positively correlated with lung impairments. Further, the underlying mechanisms were investigated in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). Consistent with the &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; findings, SiNPs caused the impairments on mitochondrial structure, as well as the activation of ROS generation and oxidative injury. Upon SiNPs stimuli, mitochondrial respiration was greatly inhibited, while Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload in cytosol and mitochondria owing to ER calcium release was noticed, resulting in mitochondrial-dependent epithelial apoptosis. More importantly, mitochondrial dynamics was imbalanced toward a fission type, as evidenced by upregulated DRP1 and its phosphorylation at Ser616 (DRP1&lt;sup&gt;s616&lt;/sup&gt;), while downregulated DRP1&lt;sup&gt;s637&lt;/sup&gt;, and also MFN1, MFN2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the activation of ROS/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling promoted DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission by SiNPs, forming a vicious cycle, and ultimately contributing to apoptosis in 16HBE. In summary, our results disclosed SiNPs caused pulmonary injury through the induction of epithelial apoptosis via a ROS/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial citrate accumulation drives alveolar epithelial cell necroptosis in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36443565/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necroptosis is the major cause of death in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) during acute lung injury (ALI). Here, we report a previously unrecognized mechanism for necroptosis. We found an accumulation of mitochondrial citrate (citratemt) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated AECs because of the downregulation of Idh3α and citrate carrier (CIC, also known as Slc25a1). shRNA- or inhibitor-mediated inhibition of Idh3α and Slc25a1 induced citratemt accumulation and necroptosis in vitro. Mice with AEC-specific Idh3α and Slc25a1 deficiency exhibited exacerbated lung injury and AEC necroptosis. Interestingly, the overexpression of Idh3α and Slc25a1 decreased citratemt levels and rescued AECs from necroptosis. Mechanistically, citratemt accumulation induced mitochondrial fission and excessive mitophagy in AECs. Furthermore, citratemt directly interacted with FUN14 domain-containing protein 1 (FUNDC1) and promoted the interaction of FUNDC1 with dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), leading to excessive mitophagy-mediated necroptosis and thereby initiating and promoting ALI. Importantly, necroptosis induced by citratemt accumulation was inhibited in FUNDC1-knockout AECs. We show that citratemt accumulation is a novel target for protection against ALI involving necroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messenger RNA has now been used to vaccinate millions of people. However, the diversity of pulmonary pathologies, including infections, genetic disorders, asthma and others, reveals the lung as an important organ to directly target for future RNA therapeutics and preventatives. Here we report the screening of 166 polymeric nanoparticle formulations for functional delivery to the lungs, obtained from a combinatorial synthesis approach combined with a low-dead-volume nose-only inhalation system for mice. We identify P76, a poly-β-amino-thio-ester polymer, that exhibits increased expression over formulations lacking the thiol component, delivery to different animal species with varying RNA cargos and low toxicity. P76 allows for dose sparing when delivering an mRNA-expressed Cas13a-mediated treatment in a SARS-CoV-2 challenge model, resulting in similar efficacy to a 20-fold higher dose of a neutralizing antibody. Overall, the combinatorial synthesis approach allowed for the discovery of promising polymeric formulations for future RNA pharmaceutical development for the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attenuation of the Severity of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by Pomiferin through Blocking Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in an AKT/Foxo1 Pathway-Dependent Manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36471865/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) gives rise to uncontrolled inflammatory response and oxidative stress, causing very high mortality globally. Pomiferin is a kind of prenylated isoflavonoid extracted from &lt;em&gt;Maclura pomifera&lt;/em&gt;, owning anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the functions and possible mechanisms of pomiferin in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ARDS remain unknown. C57BL/6 mice were injected with LPS (5 mg/kg) intratracheally to induce an in vivo ARDS model while RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) to induce an in vitro model. Our data demonstrated that pomiferin (20 mg/kg) significantly improved pulmonary function and lung pathological injury in mice with ARDS, apart from increasing survival rate. Meanwhile, pomiferin treatment also inhibited LPS-induced inflammation as well as oxidative stress in lung tissues. LPS stimulation significantly activated AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway in lung tissues, which could be reversed after pomiferin treatment. In vitro experiments further showed that 10, 20, and 50 μM of pomiferin could enhance cell viability of RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with LPS. What is more, 3-deoxysappanchalcone (3-DE), one AKT agonist, was used to active AKT in RAW264.7 macrophages. The results further showed that 3-DE could abolish pomiferin-elicited protection in LPS-treated RAW264.7 macrophages, evidenced by activated inflammation and oxidative stress. Taken together, our study showed that pomiferin could exert an ARDS-protective effect by blocking the AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway to inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative injury, which may serve as a potential candidate for the treatment of ARDS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine is a biomarker and potential therapeutic target for community-acquired pneumonia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lysophosphatidylcholine decreases in CAP patients during the acute phase of the disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPC14:0 demonstrates excellent diagnostic performance in predicting CAP disease severity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPC14:0 exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects in vivo and in vitro experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no gold standard for evaluating the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and it is still based on a score. This study aimed to use the metabolomics method to find promised biomarkers in assessing disease severity and potential therapeutic targets for CAP. The result found that the metabolites in the plasma samples of CAP patients had significantly different between the acute phase and the remission phase, especially lysophosphatidylcholine (LPCs) in glycerophospholipids, whose levels are negatively linked to the severity of the disease. Subsequently, the two key metabolites of myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC 14:0) and LPC 16:1 were screened. We analyzed the predictive performance of the two metabolites using Spearman-related analysis and ROC curves, and LPC14:0 showed more satisfactory diagnostic performance than LPC16:1. Then we explored the protective role and mechanism of LPC 14:0 in animal and cell models. The results showed that LPC 14:0 could inhibit the LPS-induced secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, lower the ROS and MDA levels, and decreased the depletion of SOD and GSH, thereby reducing lung tissue and cell damage, such as down-regulating the protein level in BALF, lung W/D ratio, MPO activity, and apoptosis. We found that LPC 14:0 inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress, and the above protection was achieved by inhibiting LPS-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. LPC 14:0 may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting the severity of CAP. In addition, our exploration of the role of LPC 14:0 in animal and cellular models has reinforced its promise as a therapeutic target to improve the clinical efficacy for CAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPS-induced alveolar macrophage inflammation and alveolar epithelial cell death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIT1 could relieve LPS-induced acute lung injury model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIT1 decreased TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 expression in MH-S cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIT1 suppressed MLE-12 cell apoptosis induced by MH-S cell supernatant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is featured by intensive inflammatory responses causing significant morbidity and mortality. Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), induced by interferon (IFN), has been discovered to modulate viral infection and cell apoptosis and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, it’s role and mechanism in ALI remain unclear and need to be explored furtherly. Here, we discovered that IFIT1 decreased the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in mouse-derived macrophage cells (MH-S) and alleviated apoptosis of murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) induced by MH-S cell supernatant, contributing to anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis (RNA-seq) showed that inflammatory chemokine Csingle bondC motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) partially eliminated the protective effects of IFIT1 and promoted the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 by CCL5-p65NF-κB signaling pathway. This study demonstrated that IFIT1 attenuated ALI-associated inflammation and cell apoptosis by regulating the CCL5-p65NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings are of great significance for the treatment of lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) remains a global public health issue without specific and effective treatment options available in the clinic. Alveolar macrophage polarization is involved in the initiation, development and progression of ALI; however, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) acts as an antioxidant in pulmonary inflammation and has been demonstrated to be linked with the severity and prognosis of ALI. In this study, the therapeutic effects of HO-1 were examined, along with the mechanisms involved, mainly focusing on alveolar macrophage polarization. HO-1 depletion induced higher iNOS and CD86 (M1 phenotype) expression but was significantly decreased in Arg-1 and CD206 (M2 phenotype) expression in BALF alveolar macrophages after equivalent LPS stimulation. We also found that HO-1 deletion distinctly accelerated the expression of inflammasome-associated components NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 in vivo and in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, on the basis of LPS for MH-S cells, levels of TXNIP, NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 were increased and HO-1 depletion exacerbated these changes, whereas double depletion of HO-1 and TXNIP partially mitigated these elevations. Also, HO-1 knockdown induced more M1 phenotype and less M2 phenotype compared with LPS alone, whereas double silence of HO-1 and TXNIP partially changed the polarization state. Taken together, we demonstrated that HO-1 could modulate macrophage polarization via TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway, which could be a potential therapeutic target for ALI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective effect and mechanism of baicalin on lung inflammatory injury in BALB/cJ mice induced by PM2.5</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respiratory function impairment caused by PM2.5 exposure could be improved by baicalin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baicalin regulates the composition and diversity of pharyngeal microbiota in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baicalin alleviates the respiratory inflammatory response caused by PM2.5 exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baicalin exerts anti-inflammatory effects by the HMGB1/NLRP3/Casepase1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public health harms caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have become a global focus, with PM2.5 exposure recognized as a critical risk factor for global morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation is the common pathophysiological feature of respiratory diseases induced by PM2.5 and is the most critical cause of all these diseases. However, presently there is a lack of effective preventive and therapeutic approaches for inflammatory lung injuries caused by PM2.5 exposure. Baicalin is a herb-derived effective flavonoid compound with multiple health benefits. This study established a murine lung inflammatory injury model via inhalation of PM2.5 aerosols. The data showed that after baicalin intervention, lung injury pathological score of baicalin (4.16 ± 0.54, 3.33 ± 0.76, 4.00 ± 0.45) and claricid (3.00 ± 0.78) treatments were markedly lower than PM2.5-treated mice (6.17 ± 0.31), and pathological damage was alleviated. Compared to the PM2.5 group, the spleen and lung indexes in the baicalin and claricid groups were significantly reduced. The inflammatory cytokines of TNF-α, IL-18, and IL-1β in serum, alveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissue were significantly decreased in the baicalin and claricid groups. The expressions of inflammatory pathway-related genes and proteins HMGB1, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 were up-regulated in the PM2.5 group. The expressions of these genes and proteins were significantly decreased following baicalin treatment. The lung function indicators showed that the MV (65.94 ± 8.19 mL), sRaw (1.79 ± 0.08 cm H2O.s), and FRC (0.52 ± 0.01 mL) in the PM2.5 group were higher than in the control and baicalin groups, and respiratory function was improved by baicalin. PM2.5 exposure markedly altered the bacterial composition at the genus level. The dominant flora relative abundances of uncultured_bacterium_f_Muribaculaceae, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus, were decreased from the control group (9.20%, 8.53%, 6.21%) to PM2.5 group (6.26%, 5.49%, 4.77%), respectively. Following baicalin intervention, the relative abundances were 9.72%, 6.65%, and 3.57%, respectively. Therefore, baicalin could potentially prevent and improve mice lung inflammatory injury induced by PM2.5 exposure. Baicalin might provide a protective role by balancing oropharyngeal microbiota and affecting the expression of the HMGB1/Caspase1 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1,2,3,4,6-O-Pentagalloylglucose Protects against Acute Lung Injury by Activating the AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 Pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious lung disease with a high mortality rate, warranting the development of novel therapies. Previously, we reported that 1,2,3,4,6-O-pentagalloylglucose (PGG) could afford protection against ALI, however, the PGG-mediated protective effects remain elusive. Herein, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) markedly inhibited the lung wet/drug weight ratio and attenuated histological changes in the lungs (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). A pretreatment with PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) reduced the number of total leukocytes and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) also attenuated oxidative stress by reducing the formation of formation and the depletion of superoxide dismutase to treat an ALI (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). To further explore the PGG-induced mechanism against an ALI, we screened the PGG pathway using immunohistochemical analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and Western blotting (WB). WB revealed that the expression levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (p-AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B phosphorylation (P-Akt), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) were significantly higher in the PGG group (60 and 30 mg/kg) than in the lipopolysaccharide group (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05); these findings were confirmed by the immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence results. Accordingly, PGG could be effective against an ALI by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress via AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling, allowing for the potential development of this as a natural drug against an ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chronic exposure to carbon black ultrafine particles reprograms macrophage metabolism and accelerates lung cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic exposure to airborne carbon black ultrafine (nCB) particles generated from incomplete combustion of organic matter drives IL-17A–dependent emphysema. However, whether and how they alter the immune responses to lung cancer remains unknown. Here, we show that exposure to nCB particles increased PD-L1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; PD-L2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD206&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antigen-presenting cells (APCs), exhausted T cells, and Treg cells. Lung macrophages that harbored nCB particles showed selective mitochondrial structure damage and decreased oxidative respiration. Lung macrophages sustained the HIF1α axis that increased glycolysis and lactate production, culminating in an immunosuppressive microenvironment in multiple mouse models of non–small cell lung cancers. Adoptive transfer of lung APCs from nCB-exposed wild type to susceptible mice increased tumor incidence and caused early metastasis. Our findings show that nCB exposure metabolically rewires lung macrophages to promote immunosuppression and accelerates the development of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating hyaluronic acid signature in CAP and ARDS - the role of pneumolysin in hyaluronic acid shedding</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soluble HA levels are elevated in CAP and ARDS plasma and are associated with an increase in 28-day mortality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soluble HA levels correlate with disease severity and markers of inflammation, endothelial cell activation, and basement membrane destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small and large HA fragments are detected in plasma of most severe CAP or ARDS patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pneumolysin induces HA release from human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pneumolysin-induced HA shedding is dependent on reactive oxygen species production and is not associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shedding of hyaluronan (HA), the component of endothelial cell (EC) glycocalyx, has been associated with acute lung injury. HA degradation allows plasma proteins and fluid to penetrate across the vascular wall leading to lung edema formation and leukocyte recruitment. Here, we analyzed sHA levels and size in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), correlated them to disease severity, and evaluated the impact of pneumolysin (PLY), the Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.p.) exotoxin, on HA shedding from human pulmonary microvascular EC (HPMVEC). sHA levels were elevated in CAP and ARDS and correlated with the CRB65 severity score and with markers of inflammation (interleukin-6), EC activation (E-selectin), and basement membrane destruction (collagen IV). Furthermore, sHA levels were associated with an increase in 28-day mortality. Small and large sHA fragments were detected in plasma of most severe CAP or ARDS patients, and the presence of large sHA fragments was accompanied by the elevated levels of circulating collagen IV. In vitro, PLY induced sHA release from HPMVEC. This effect was dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and was not associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction. Conversely, HA shedding was impaired following HPMVEC infection with a S.p. PLY-deficient mutant. Our study identifies association between the severity of CAP and ARDS and the levels and size of sHA in plasma. It links sHA levels with, inflammation, EC activation status and basement membrane disassembly in ARDS and provides insights into the mechanism of HA shedding during infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Melatonin Suppresses Macrophage M1 Polarization and ROS-Mediated Pyroptosis via Activating ApoE/LDLR Pathway in Influenza A-Induced Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36425057/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza virus infection is one of the strongest pathogenic factors for the development of acute lung injury (ALI)/ acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms have not been clarified. In this study, we aim to investigate whether melatonin modulates macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis via activating Apolipoprotein E/low-density lipoprotein receptor (ApoE/LDLR) pathway in influenza A-induced ALI. Here, wild-type (WT) and ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice were instilled intratracheally with influenza A (H3N2) and injected intraperitoneally with melatonin for 7 consecutive days. In vitro, WT and ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were pretreated with melatonin before H3N2 stimulation. The results showed that melatonin administration significantly attenuated H3N2-induced pulmonary damage, leukocyte infiltration, and edema; decreased the expression of proinflammatory M1 markers; enhanced anti-inflammatory M2 markers; and switched the polarization of alveolar macrophages (AMs) from M1 to M2 phenotype. Additionally, melatonin inhibited reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) mediated pyroptosis shown by downregulation of malonaldehyde (MDA) and ROS levels as well as inhibition of the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Strikingly, the ApoE/LDLR pathway was activated when melatonin was applied in H3N2-infected macrophages and mice. ApoE knockout mostly abrogated the protective impacts of melatonin on H3N2-induced ALI and its regulatory ability on macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis. Furthermore, recombinant ApoE3 (re-ApoE3) inhibited H3N2-induced M1 polarization of BMDMs with upregulation of MT1 and MT2 expression, but re-ApoE2 and re-ApoE4 failed to do this. Melatonin combined with re-ApoE3 played more beneficial protective effects on modulating macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis in H3N2-infected ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; BMDMs. Our study indicated that melatonin attenuated influenza A- (H3N2-) induced ALI by inhibiting the M1 polarization of pulmonary macrophages and ROS-mediated pyroptosis via activating the ApoE/LDLR pathway. This study suggested that melatonin-ApoE/LDLR axis may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for influenza virus-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astaxanthin ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via inhibition of inflammatory reactions and modulation of the SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a systemic inflammatory process. A large number of studies have shown that astaxanthin (ASTA) has strong anti-inflammatory effects and almost non-toxic side effects. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of ASTA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice and its underlying mechanism. The result showed that compared with the LPS group, the expression levels of the respiratory resistance (Re), inspiratory resistance (Ri), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio, albumin (BA/SA) ratio and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the ASTA pretreatment group were significantly reduced, and total cell, neutrophil and macrophage counts were significantly decreased. HE staining results showed that alveolar interstitial edema, bleeding and erythrocyte exudation were reduced. Compared with the LPS group, the percentage of Th17 cells and the content of interleukin (IL)-17 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the ASTA pretreatment group were significantly decreased, while the content of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and the percentage of Treg cells were significantly increased. Western blot analysis showed that ASTA could up-regulate the expression level of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) and down-regulate the expression levels of phosphorylated Janus kinase 2 (p-JAK2), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) in lung tissue. The results showed that ASTA had a protective effect on LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, and its protective mechanism was through activating the SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting Treg cell differentiation and reducing inflammatory reactions and Th17 cell differentiation, which provided a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cirsilineol Treatment Attenuates PM2.5-Induced Lung Injury in Mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafine particulate matter with less than 2.5 μm diameter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) is an air pollutant that causes severe lung damage. Currently, effective treatment and preventive methods for PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung damage are limited. Cirsilineol (CSL) is a small natural compound isolated from Artemisia vestita. In this study, the efficacy of CSL on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung toxicity was tested, and its mechanism was identified. Lung injury was caused by intratracheal administration of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; suspension in animal models. Two days after PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; pretreatment, CSL was injected via mouse tail vein for two days. The effects of CSL on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung damage, autophagy, apoptosis, and pulmonary inflammation in a mouse model and their mechanisms were investigated. CSL significantly suppressed histological lung damage and lung wet/dry weight proportion. CSL also significantly reduced PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced autophagy dysfunction, apoptosis, lymphocyte suppression, and inflammatory cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF). Furthermore, CSL increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation and significantly inhibited the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, MyD88, and the autophagy proteins, Beclin1 and LC3II. Thus, CSL exerts protective effects on pulmonary damage by regulating mTOR and TLR2,4–myD88 autophagy pathways. Therefore, CSL can be used as an effective treatment for PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance: Xuebijing injection is a Chinese herbal-derived drug composed of radix paeoniaerubra, rhizomachuanxiong, Salvia miltiorrhiza, floscarthami, and Angelica sinensis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Xuebijing administration on pulmonary endothelial injury and coagulation dysfunction in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis rat model. Materials and methods: A CLP-induced sepsis rat model was established. The CLP rats were treated with a vehicle or Xuebijing via intravenous infusion and sacrificed at 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 h after CLP for lung tissue and blood sample collection. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was monitored. Transmission microscopy examination and H&amp;amp;E staining were performed to observe pulmonary structural alterations. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the plasma levels of epithelial markers, proinflammatory cytokines, and coagulation-related proteins. Results: Compared with vehicle treatment, Xuebijing administration maintained the MAP in the normal range until 11 h after CLP. Transmission microscopy and H&amp;amp;E staining revealed that Xuebijing administration alleviated alveolar–capillary barrier impairments and lung inflammation in CLP rats. ELISA showed that Xuebijing administration effectively reversed CLP-induced elevations in the plasma levels of epithelial markers endothelin-1 and von Willebrand factor, starting 6 and 8 h after CLP, respectively. Xuebijing administration also significantly abolished CLP-induced rises in circulating proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) at 6 h after CLP, IL-1β at 2 and 12 h after CLP, and TNF-α at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after CLP. In addition, Xuebijing administration strongly reversed CLP-induced alterations in circulating active protein C and tissue-type plasminogen activator, starting 4 h and 2 h after CLP, respectively. Conclusions: Xuebijing ameliorates pulmonary endothelial injury, systemic inflammation, and coagulation dysfunction in early sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by molecular heterogeneity with diverse immune cell infiltration patterns, which has been linked to therapy sensitivity and resistance. However, full understanding of how immune cell phenotypes vary across different patient subgroups is lacking. Here, we dissect the NSCLC tumor microenvironment at high resolution by integrating 1,283,972 single cells from 556 samples and 318 patients across 29 datasets, including our dataset capturing cells with low mRNA content. We stratify patients into immune-deserted, B cell, T cell, and myeloid cell subtypes. Using bulk samples with genomic and clinical information, we identify cellular components associated with tumor histology and genotypes. We then focus on the analysis of tissue-resident neutrophils (TRNs) and uncover distinct subpopulations that acquire new functional properties in the tissue microenvironment, providing evidence for the plasticity of TRNs. Finally, we show that a TRN-derived gene signature is associated with anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) treatment failure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human lung cellular portfolio, traditionally characterized by cellular morphology and individual markers, is highly diverse, with over 40 cell types and a complex branching structure highly adapted for agile airflow and gas exchange. While constant during adulthood, lung cellular content changes in response to exposure, injury, and infection. Some changes are temporary, but others are persistent, leading to structural changes and progressive lung disease. The recent advance of single-cell profiling technologies allows an unprecedented level of detail and scale to cellular measurements, leading to the rise of comprehensive cell atlas styles of reporting. In this review, we chronical the rise of cell atlases and explore their contributions to human lung biology in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Xuanfei Baidu formula alleviates impaired mitochondrial dynamics and activated NLRP3 inflammasome by repressing NF-κB and MAPK pathways in LPS-induced ALI and inflammation models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36423572/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36423572/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xuanfei Baidu Formula (XBF) is an effective traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) remedy for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. This herbal medicine has shown effects in reducing clinical symptoms and shortening the average length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that XBF alleviates acute lung injury (ALI) by regulating macrophage-mediated immune inflammation, but the mechanisms of action remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to evaluate the lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of XBF and its underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, XBF&amp;rsquo;s effects were investigated in an ALI mouse model induced by inhalation of atomized lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Besides, the LPS-induced inflammation model in RAW264.7 cells was used to clarify the underlying mechanisms of XBF against ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results showed that XBF treatment alleviated LPS-induced lung injury, as evidenced by reduced histopathological changes, pulmonary alveoli permeability, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the lung tissues. In addition, inflammation was alleviated as shown by decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and reduced white blood cell (WBC) count in BALF. Furthermore, consistent with the in vivo assay, XBF inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines release and pro-inflammatory polarization in RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, XBF increased mitochondrial fusion by upregulating Mfn1 and attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by repressing Casp11, respectively, to inhibit NF-κB and MAPK pathways, thus repressing pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we demonstrate that XBF exerts anti-ALI and -inflammatory effects by recovering mitochondrial dynamics and reducing inflammasome activation, providing a biological illustration of the clinical efficacy of XBF in treating COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bats are reservoir hosts of many zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential. We utilized single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the immune response in bat lungs upon &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; infection with a double-stranded RNA virus, &lt;em&gt;Pteropine orthoreovirus&lt;/em&gt; PRV3M. Bat neutrophils were distinguished by high basal &lt;em&gt;IDO1&lt;/em&gt; expression. NK cells and T cells were the most abundant immune cells in lung tissue. Three distinct CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; effector T cell populations could be delineated by differential expression of &lt;em&gt;KLRB1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;GFRA2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DPP4&lt;/em&gt;. Select NK and T clusters increased expression of genes involved in T cell activation and effector function early after viral infection. Alveolar macrophages and classical monocytes drove antiviral interferon signaling. Infection expanded a &lt;em&gt;CSF1R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; population expressing collagen-like genes, which became the predominant myeloid cell type post-infection. This work uncovers features relevant to viral disease tolerance in bats, lays a foundation for future experimental work, and serves as a resource for comparative immunology studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beneficial effects of CCL8 inhibition at lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36404927/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CCL8 (MCP-2) is a chemoattractive cytokine associated with various immune-related pathologies. Recent studies show that CCL8 is significantly stimulated during acute respiratory distress syndrome in severely ill patients with COVID-19, making the inhibition of CCL8 activity a promising treatment. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury was evaluated in mice using a neutralizing antibody (1G3E5) against human CCL8. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that following IP administration, 1G3E5 was sustained at higher levels and for a longer period compared to IV administration. CCL8 expression in the lungs was not enhanced by LPS, but CCR2 and CCR5 receptors were significantly stimulated. 1G3E5-mediated inhibition of CCL8 was associated with the reduction of pulmonary inflammation and suppression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results point to a previously unrecognized, permissive role for CCL8 in mediating cytokine induction and ultimately sustaining inflammation. Disruption of CCL8 activity may provide a strategy for mitigating pulmonary inflammation during lung injury when related to abnormal cytokine induction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and Rab GTPases coordinate EGFR trafficking to regulate macrophage activation in sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36344490/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EGFR phosphorylation is required for TLR4-mediated macrophage activation during sepsis. However, whether and how intracellular EGFR is transported during endotoxemia have largely been unknown. Here, we show that LPS promotes high levels cell surface expression of EGFR in macrophages through two different transport mechanisms. On one hand, Rab10 is required for EEA1-mediated the membrane translocation of EGFR from the Golgi. On the other hand, EGFR phosphorylation prevents its endocytosis in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced membrane EGFR expression in LPS-activated macrophage. Mechanistically, upon LPS induced TLR4/EGFR phosphorylation, MAPK14 phosphorylated Rab7a at S72 impaired membrane receptor late endocytosis, which maintains EGFR membrane localization though blocking its lysosomal degradation. Meanwhile, Rab5a is also involved in the early endocytosis of EGFR. Subsequently, inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation switches M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype and alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury. Mechanistic study demonstrated that Erlotinib suppressed glycolysis-dependent M1 polarization via PKM2/HIF-1ɑ pathway and promoted M2 polarization through up-regulating PPARγ induced glutamine metabolism. Collectively, our data elucidated a more in-depth mechanism of macrophages activation, and provided stronger evidence supporting EGFR as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblast growth factor 10 protects against particulate matter-induced lung injury by inhibiting oxidative stress-mediated pyroptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36461597/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulate matter (PM) is a major environmental contaminant that causes and worsens respiratory diseases. Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10), a paracrine fibroblast growth factor that specifically stimulates repair and regeneration after injury, has been shown to protect against PM-induced lung injury. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, the protective effects of FGF10 were investigated using a PM-induced lung injury mouse model in vivo and BEAS-2B cells in vitro. According to the findings, FGF10 treatment alleviated PM-induced oxidative damage and pyroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, FGF10 activated antioxidative Nrf2 signaling. Inhibition of PI3K signaling with LY294002 or Nrf2 signaling with ML385 revealed that FGF10-mediated lung protection was mediated by the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. These results collectively indicate that FGF10 inhibits oxidative stress-mediated pyroptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway, suggesting a possible therapy for PM-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bacterial polyphosphates induce CXCL4 and synergize with complement anaphylatoxin C5a in lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36405694/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyphosphates are linear polymers of inorganic phosphates that exist in all living cells and serve pleiotropic functions. Bacteria produce long-chain polyphosphates, which can interfere with host defense to infection. In contrast, short-chain polyphosphates are released from platelet dense granules and bind to the chemokine CXCL4. Here, we report that long-chain polyphosphates induced the release of CXCL4 from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages in a dose-/time-dependent fashion resulting from an induction of CXCL4 mRNA. This polyphosphate effect was lost after pre-incubation with recombinant exopolyphosphatase (PPX) Fc fusion protein, demonstrating the potency of long chains over monophosphates and ambient cations. In detail, polyphosphate chains &amp;gt;70 inorganic phosphate residues were required to reliably induce CXCL4. Polyphosphates acted independently of the purinergic P2Y1 receptor and the MyD88/TRIF adaptors of Toll-like receptors. On the other hand, polyphosphates augmented LPS/MyD88-induced CXCL4 release, which was explained by intracellular signaling convergence on PI3K/Akt. Polyphosphates induced Akt phosphorylation at threonine-308. Pharmacologic blockade of PI3K (wortmannin, LY294002) antagonized polyphosphate-induced CXCL4 release from macrophages. Intratracheal polyphosphate administration to C57BL/6J mice caused histologic signs of lung injury, disruption of the endothelial-epithelial barrier, influx of Ly6G&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; polymorphonuclear neutrophils, depletion of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;SiglecF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; alveolar macrophages, and release of CXCL4. Long-chain polyphosphates synergized with the complement anaphylatoxin, C5a, which was partly explained by upregulation of C5aR1 on myeloid cells. C5aR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice were protected from polyphosphate-induced lung injury. C5a generation occurred in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of polyphosphate-treated C57BL/6J mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate that polyphosphates govern immunomodulation in macrophages and promote acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HIF1A-dependent induction of alveolar epithelial PFKFB3 dampens acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36326834/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe form of lung inflammation causing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients. ALI pathogenesis is closely linked to uncontrolled alveolar inflammation. We hypothesize that specific enzymes of the glycolytic pathway could function as key regulators of alveolar inflammation. Therefore, we screened isolated alveolar epithelia from mice exposed to ALI induced by injurious ventilation to assess their metabolic responses. These studies pointed us toward a selective role for isoform 3 of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3). Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of Pfkfb3 in alveolar epithelia (Pfkfb3loxP/loxP SPC-ER-Cre+ mice) was associated with profound increases in ALI during injurious mechanical ventilation or acid instillation. Studies in genetic models linked Pfkfb3 expression and function to Hif1a. Not only did intratracheal pyruvate instillation reconstitute Pfkfb3loxP/loxP or Hif1aloxP/loxP SPC-ER-Cre+ mice, but pyruvate was also effective in ALI treatment of wild-type mice. Finally, proof-of-principle studies in human lung biopsies demonstrated increased PFKFB3 staining in injured lungs and colocalized PFKFB3 to alveolar epithelia. These studies reveal a specific role for PFKFB3 in counterbalancing alveolar inflammation and lay the groundwork for novel metabolic therapeutic approaches during ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ibrutinib Prevents Acute Lung Injury via Multi-Targeting BTK, FLT3 and EGFR in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36362264/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibrutinib has potential therapeutic or protective effects against viral- and bacterial-induced acute lung injury (ALI), likely by modulating the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling pathway. However, ibrutinib has multi-target effects. Moreover, immunity and inflammation targets in ALI treatment are poorly defined. We investigated whether the BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related signaling pathways mediated the protective effects of ibrutinib on ALI. The intratracheal administration of poly I:C or LPS after ibrutinib administration in mice was performed by gavage. The pathological conditions of the lungs were assessed by micro-CT and HE staining. The levels of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and related inflammatory factors in the lungs were evaluated by ELISA, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. Finally, the expression of proteins associated with the BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related signaling pathways were evaluated by Western blotting. Ibrutinib (10 mg/kg) protected against poly I:C-induced (5 mg/kg) and LPS-induced (5 mg/kg) lung inflammation. The wet/dry weight ratio (W/D) and total proteins in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were markedly reduced after ibrutinib (10 mg/kg) treatment, relative to the poly I:C- and LPS-treated groups. The levels of ALI indicators (NFκB, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) were significantly reduced after treatment. Accordingly, ibrutinib inhibited the poly I:C- and LPS-induced BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related pathway activations. Ibrutinib inhibited poly I:C- and LPS-induced acute lung injury, and this may be due to its ability to suppress the BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related signaling pathways. Therefore, ibrutinib is a potential protective agent for regulating immunity and inflammation in poly I:C- and LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrating bulk and single-cell sequencing reveals the phenotype-associated cell subpopulations in sepsis-induced acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dysfunctional immune response and multiple organ injury in sepsis is a recurrent theme impacting prognosis and mortality, while the lung is the first organ invaded by sepsis. To systematically elucidate the transcriptomic changes in the main constituent cells of sepsis-injured lung tissue, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to the lung tissue samples from septic and control mice and created a comprehensive cellular landscape with 25044 cells, including 11317 immune and 13727 non-immune cells. Sepsis alters the composition of all cellular compartments, particularly neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, endothelial, and fibroblasts populations. Our study firstly provides a single-cell view of cellular changes in septic lung injury. Furthermore, by integrating bulk sequencing data and single-cell data with the Scissors-method, we identified the cell subpopulations that are most associated with septic lung injury phenotype. The phenotypic-related cell subpopulations identified by Scissors-method were consistent with the cell subpopulations with significant composition changes. The function analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the cell-cell interaction analysis further reveal the important role of these phenotype-related subpopulations in septic lung injury. Our research provides a rich resource for understanding cellular changes and provides insights into the contributions of specific cell types to the biological processes that take place during sepsis-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mefunidone ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury through inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway and enhancing Nrf2 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36334370/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary edema and hyperemia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary structure disorder, inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone reduces reactive oxygen species generation through increasing expression of nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and objective:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease which has high mortality and lacks effective pharmacological treatments. Excessive inflammation and oxidative stress are the key pathogenesis of ALI. Mefunidone (MFD), a novel small molecule compound, displayed anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress effects on streptozocin (STZ) and db/db mice in our previous studies. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of MFD on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and explore the potential molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the effects of MFD on LPS-induced ALI mouse model and LPS-stimulated immortalized mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MFD could alleviate pulmonary structure disorder and attenuate pulmonary neutrophils infiltration induced by LPS. MFD could also decreased proinflammatory cytokines release and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation stimulated by LPS. Further, MFD could significantly reduce LPS-induced phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), increase expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and restore the expressions of antioxidant enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results firstly supported that MFD effectively protected LPS-induced ALI against inflammation and oxidative stress through inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway and activating Nrf2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles in the pathogenesis and treatment of acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36316787/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are common life-threatening lung diseases associated with acute and severe inflammation. Both have high mortality rates, and despite decades of research on clinical ALI/ARDS, there are no effective therapeutic strategies. Disruption of alveolar-capillary barrier integrity or activation of inflammatory responses leads to lung inflammation and injury. Recently, studies on the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in regulating normal and pathophysiologic cell activities, including inflammation and injury responses, have attracted attention. Injured and dysfunctional cells often secrete EVs into serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with altered cargoes, which can be used to diagnose and predict the development of ALI/ARDS. EVs secreted by mesenchymal stem cells can also attenuate inflammatory reactions associated with cell dysfunction and injury to preserve or restore cell function, and thereby promote cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. This review focuses on the roles of EVs in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation, particularly ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CXCL12 defines lung endothelial heterogeneity and promotes distal vascular growth</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36239312/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a growing amount of data uncovering the cellular diversity of the pulmonary circulation and mechanisms governing vascular repair after injury. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to the morphogenesis and growth of the pulmonary vasculature during embryonic development are less clear. Importantly, deficits in vascular development lead to significant pediatric lung diseases, indicating a need to uncover fetal programs promoting vascular growth. To address this, we used a transgenic mouse reporter for expression of Cxcl12, an arterial endothelial hallmark gene, and performed single-cell RNA sequencing on isolated Cxcl12-DsRed+ endothelium to assess cellular heterogeneity within pulmonary endothelium. Combining cell annotation with gene ontology and histological analysis allowed us to segregate the developing artery endothelium into functionally and spatially distinct subpopulations. Expression of Cxcl12 is highest in the distal arterial endothelial subpopulation, a compartment enriched in genes for vascular development. Accordingly, disruption of CXCL12 signaling led to, not only abnormal branching, but also distal vascular hypoplasia. These data provide evidence for arterial endothelial functional heterogeneity and reveal conserved signaling mechanisms essential for pulmonary vascular development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure to Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; causes an inflammatory reaction and fibrosis in lung tissue of mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increases H19 and TNFRSF1A levels, decreases miR-29a-3p levels, and activates the NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells and mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;H19 via miR-29a-3p-regulated TNFRSF1A is involved in Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study provide a tool for assessing lung injury risk of Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and other environmental factors that induce inflammatory response and pulmonary fibrosis-associated lncRNAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The occupational and environmental health safety of rare earths has attracted considerable attention. In China, the rare earth neodymium oxide (Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is extensively refined and utilized. However, the mechanisms of Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury are elusive. In the present study, we found that exposure of mice to Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; caused an inflammatory reaction and fibrosis in lung tissues, which was in relation to the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced higher levels of the lncRNA H19 (H19), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFRSF1A), p-p65, and p-IKKβ and lower levels of miR-29a-3p. Further, in mouse monocyte macrophage leukemia cells (RAW264.7), Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; induced an inflammatory reaction, increases of H19 and TNFRSF1A levels, decreases of miR-29a-3p levels, and activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway. Further, we established that miR-29a-3p regulates TNFRSF1A expression. Up-regulation of miR-29a-3p and down-regulation of H19 blocked the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced secretion of TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-6; the increases of TNFRSF1A levels; and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells. Further, in Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-treated RAW26.4 cells, H19 inhibited the expression of miR-29a-3p, which targets TNFRSF1A, and activated the NF-κB signaling pathway to enhance the expression of TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-6. Moreover, for mice, up-regulation of miR-29a-3p reversed lung tissue inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway induced by Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In sum, the present investigation shows that H19 via miR-29a-3p is involved in lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis induced by Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a mechanism for the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung inflammatory response and pulmonary fibrosis. This information is useful for development of a biomarker of Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salt-inducible kinase 2 regulates fibrosis during bleomycin-induced lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and normally fatal disease with limited treatment options. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib has recently been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and its effectiveness has been linked to its ability to inhibit a number of receptor tyrosine kinases including the platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor receptors. We show here that nintedanib also inhibits salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2), with a similar IC50 to its reported tyrosine kinase targets. Nintedanib also inhibited the related kinases SIK1 and SIK3, although with 12-fold and 72-fold higher IC50s, respectively. To investigate if the inhibition of SIK2 may contribute to the effectiveness of nintedanib in treating lung fibrosis, mice with kinase-inactive knockin mutations were tested using a model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. We found that loss of SIK2 activity protects against bleomycin-induced fibrosis, as judged by collagen deposition and histological scoring. Loss of both SIK1 and SIK2 activity had a similar effect to loss of SIK2 activity. Total SIK3 knockout mice have a developmental phenotype making them unsuitable for analysis in this model; however, we determined that conditional knockout of SIK3 in the immune system did not affect bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Together, these results suggest that SIK2 is a potential drug target for the treatment of lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Naringenin attenuates inflammation, apoptosis, and ferroptosis in silver nanoparticle-induced lung injury through a mechanism associated with Nrf2/HO-1 axis: In vitro and in vivo studies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36306867/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the wide application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), their potential damage to human health needs to be investigated. Lung is one of the main target organs after inhalation of AgNPs. Naringenin has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of naringenin against AgNPs-induced lung injury and determine the underlying mechanism. In in vivo experiments, AgNPs were intratracheally instilled into ICR mice (l mg/kg) to establish a lung injury model. These mice were then treated with naringenin by oral gavage (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) for three days. Naringenin treatment decreased the levels of white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in the blood, ameliorated lung injury, suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, normalized ferroptotic markers and prevented oxidative stress with elevating Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expressions in lung. In in vitro experiments, BEAS-2B cells were firstly treated with AgNPs (320 μg/mL) and then naringenin (25, 50, and 100 μM), respectively. Naringenin attenuated AgNPs-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Moreover, naringenin attenuated AgNPs-induced apoptosis with modulated low BAX, CytC, cleaved Caspase9, cleaved Caspase3 but high Bcl2. Furthermore, naringenin effectively decreased ferroptotic markers and increased the protein expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1, as well as increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Importantly, the anti-apoptotic and anti-ferroptotic effects of naringenin in BEAS-2B cells were found to be at least partially Nrf2-dependent. These results indicated that naringenin exerted anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and anti-ferroptosis effects and protected against AgNPs-induced lung injury at least partly via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circadian clock is the biochemical oscillator that orchestrates the observable circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior. Disruption of the circadian clock in the lungs during chronic pulmonary diseases is considered one of the key etiological risk factors that drive pathobiology. Preclinical studies support that pharmacological manipulation of the circadian clock is a conceivable approach for the development of novel clock-based therapeutics. Despite recent advances, no effort has been undertaken to integrate novel findings for the treatment and management of chronic lung diseases. We, therefore, recognize the need to discuss the candidate clock genes that can be potentially targeted for therapeutic intervention. Here, we aim to create the first roadmap that will advance the development of circadian- clock-based therapeutics that may provide better outcomes in treating chronic pulmonary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macrophage Sprouty4 deficiency diminishes sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36334381/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation and oxidative stress play critical roles in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Sprout4 (Spry4) is involved in regulating inflammation and tissue injury; however, its role and mechanism in sepsis-induced ALI remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Macrophage-specific Spry4 knockout (Spry4&lt;sup&gt;MKO&lt;/sup&gt;), transgenic (Spry4&lt;sup&gt;MTG&lt;/sup&gt;) mice and matched control littermates were generated and exposed to cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery to establish bacterial sepsis-induced ALI. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Spry4MKO or Spry4&lt;sup&gt;MTG&lt;/sup&gt; mice were isolated and subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation to further validate the role of Spry4 in vitro. To verify the necessity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Spry4 and AMPK double knockout mice and compound C were used in vivo and in vitro. BMDMs were treated with STO-609 to inhibit calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that macrophage Spry4 was increased in CLP mice and positively correlated with sepsis-induced ALI. Macrophage Spry4 deficiency prevented, while macrophage Spry4 overexpression exacerbated sepsis-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and ALI in mice and BMDMs. Mechanistic studies revealed that macrophage Spry4 deficiency alleviated sepsis-induced ALI through activating CaMKK2/AMPK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study identify macrophage Spry4 as a promising predictive and therapeutic target of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>After the Storm: Regeneration, Repair, and Reestablishment of Homeostasis Between the Alveolar Epithelium and Innate Immune System Following Viral Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian lung has an enormous environmental-epithelial interface that is optimized to accomplish the principal function of the respiratory system, gas exchange. One consequence of evolving such a large surface area is that the lung epithelium is continuously exposed to toxins, irritants, and pathogens. Maintaining homeostasis in this environment requires a delicate balance of cellular signaling between the epithelium and innate immune system. Following injury, the epithelium can be either fully regenerated in form and function or repaired by forming dysplastic scar tissue. In this review, we describe the major mechanisms of damage, regeneration, and repair within the alveolar niche where gas exchange occurs. With a focus on viral infection, we summarize recent work that has established how epithelial proliferation is arrested during infection and how the innate immune system guides its reconstitution during recovery. The consequence of these processes going awry are also considered, with an emphasis on how this will impact postpandemic pulmonary biology and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pulmonary delivery of curcumin-loaded glycyrrhizic acid nanoparticles for anti-inflammatory therapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36263591/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disease of the lungs. Curcumin (Cur) shows protective effects in ALI animal models. However, Cur is a hydrophobic drug and its administration into the lungs is inefficient due to its low bioavailability. In this study, glycyrrhizic acid (GA) micelles were produced and evaluated as a carrier of Cur for treatment of ALI. Cur-loaded GA (GA-Cur) nanoparticles were produced using an oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation method. The size and surface charge of the GA-Cur nanoparticles were 159 nm and -23 mV, respectively. In lipopolysaccharide-activated RAW264.7 cells, the GA-Cur nanoparticles decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels more efficiently than GA, Cur, or a simple mixture of GA and Cur (GA + Cur). This suggests that the GA-Cur nanoparticles improved the therapeutic efficiency by enhanced delivery of GA and Cur. GA-Cur inhibited the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κb and induced endogenous heme oxygenase-1 more efficiently than the other treatments. Furthermore, an in vitro toxicity test showed that GA-Cur had little cytotoxicity. In vivo therapeutic effects of GA-Cur were evaluated in ALI mouse models. GA-Cur was administered into the animals by intratracheal instillation. The results showed that GA-Cur reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner and did so more efficiently than GA, Cur, or GA + Cur. Furthermore, the hemolysis and infiltration of monocytes into the lungs were more effectively inhibited by GA-Cur than the other treatments. The data indicate that GA is an efficient carrier of Cur and an anti-inflammatory drug. Owing to their delivery efficiency and safety, GA-Cur nanoparticles will be useful for treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rhein ameliorates septic lung injury and intervenes in macrophage metabolic reprogramming in the inflammatory state by Sirtuin 1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36279970/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein prevented the progression of acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metabolism in sepsis pathological state was changed after Rhein treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein inhibited the over activation of macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein preconditioning up-regulated and activated SIRT1 signal pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is an organ dysfunction syndrome caused by the maladjustment of response to infection. Acute lung injury (ALI) appears the earliest, with urgent onset and limited treatments. Previous pharmacological studies have found that rhein (RH), an active ingredient rich in rhubarb, has multiple pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-infection and metabolic regulation. This research aimed to explore whether RH alleviates septic acute lung injury and probe possible mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the septic ALI mouse model was established by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). LPS-induced RAW264.7 model was selected to further explore the protective mechanism of RH. H&amp;amp;E staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR, and 1H NMR analysis were used to verify the protective effect of RH on ALI &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; RH could relieve pathological lung injury and pulmonary edema, reduce the serum LPS and inhibit inflammatory response in CLP mice. Further studies displayed that RH affected the metabolism &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, with significant changes in serum and lung metabolomics. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; results demonstrated that RH inhibited the expression of inflammatory mediators and factors in macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming and upregulating the expression of Sirtuin 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; RH improved the overall metabolic condition of sepsis mice by up-regulating and activating SIRT1, and inhibited the over activation of macrophages by regulating metabolism. These findings reveal the therapeutic mechanism of RH on sepsis ALI from the perspective of metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BP5 alleviates endotoxemia-induced acute lung injury by activating Nrf2 via dual regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and the Akt (Ser473)/GSK3β (Ser9)/Fyn pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36272670/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress and inflammation play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). Previously, pentapeptide bursopentin (BP5, Cys-Lys-Arg-Val-Tyr) was reported to possess significant antioxidant activity and inhibit lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced NF-κB activation in vitro, whereas little is known about its effects in vivo. In this study, we explored the effects of BP5 on endotoxemia-induced ALI in mice and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our studies revealed that BP5 markedly improved survival and effectively alleviated lung injury by reducing overoxidation and excessive inflammatory response in endotoxemia mice. In LPS-stimulated mouse primary macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells, BP5 also exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties by enhancing Nrf2 activation. Importantly, these beneficial effects were abolished by Nrf2 knockdown. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we performed localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) assays, molecular docking, together with cell-based studies, and found that BP5 inhibited the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction to promote Nrf2 nuclear translocation and activation. Moreover, BP5-induced Nrf2 activation was shown to be accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt (at Ser473) and GSK3β (at Ser9), and a decrease in Fyn nuclear accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacologically inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β obviously enhanced Fyn nuclear accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells, which partially attenuated the promoting effect of BP5 on Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and activation. Furthermore, In Nrf2-/- mice, the protective effects of BP5 on the endotoxemia-induced ALI in WT mice were largely vanished. Our findings indicated that BP5 effectively protected endotoxemia-induced ALI against oxidative stress and inflammatory response, which are largely dependent on activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Underlying mechanisms include dual regulation of the Keap-Nrf2 interaction and the Akt (Ser473)/GSK3β (Ser9)/Fyn pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Memantine nitrate MN-08 suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation to protect against sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36272262/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 significantly increased the survival rate of septic mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 improved SIRS and immune dysfunction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 attenuated septic lung injury and inflammatory infiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 exerts its protection via suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction with devastating consequences, prominent among which is lung damage. Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, is able to alleviate acute lung injury (ALI). Nitric oxide (NO) suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. MN-08, a novel nitrate derivative of memantine, possesses both the ability to antagonize NMDAR and release NO. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of MN-08 against LPS-induced systemic inflammation and septic lung injury in mice, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of MN-08 in LPS-induced mice and THP-1 macrophages. MN-08 significantly increased the survival rate of septic mice, alleviated LPS-induced sepsis in mice via improving systemic inflammatory response syndrome and immune dysfunction, and attenuated pulmonary injury and inflammatory infiltration. More importantly, the therapeutic benefit of MN-08 for sepsis was greater than that of memantine and dexamethasone. Mechanistically, MN-08 exerted anti-inflammatory activity through inhibiting nuclear translocation of NF-κB, activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and the signaling transduction of STAT3/NF-κB. In addition, MN-08 suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that MN-08 may be a promising therapeutic agent for sepsis-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RNA-Sequencing approach for exploring the therapeutic effect of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem/stromal cells on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36341363/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is significantly associated with morbidity and mortality in patients with critical diseases. In recent years, studies have identified that mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) ameliorate ALI and pulmonary fibrosis. However, the mechanism underlying this outcome in ALI has not yet been investigated. In this study, RNA sequencing technology was used to analyze the gene expression profile of lung tissue in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI rats following treatment with human umbilical cord MSC (HUCMSC). Differential expression analyses, gene ontology annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment, protein-protein interaction network identification, and hub gene analysis were also performed. HUCMSC treatment decreased inflammatory factor production and alveolar exudates, and attenuated lung damage in LPS-induced ALI rats. The RNA-Seq data indicated that HUCMSC treatment activated the IL-17, JAK-STAT, NF-κB, and TNF-α signaling pathways, increased oxygen transport, and decreased extracellular matrix organization. HUCMSC exert beneficial effects on ALI via these signaling pathways by reducing inflammation, inhibiting pulmonary fibrosis, and improving lung ventilation. Moreover, our study further revealed the hub genes (&lt;em&gt;Tbx2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nkx2-1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Atf5&lt;/em&gt;) and signaling pathways involved in HUCMSC treatment, thus providing novel perspectives for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell treatment of ALI. HUCMSC can regulate multiple genes and signaling pathways, which can prevent LPS-induced lung damage in an ALI rat model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A mouse model characterizes the roles of ZIP8 in systemic iron recycling and lung inflammation and infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36260707/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZIP8 knockout mice have elevated spleen iron levels and relative hypoferremia, suggesting that ZIP8 plays a role in iron recycling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While lung ZIP8 is induced with inflammation, ZIP8 deletion in mice had no detrimental effects on acute lung injury or bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZIP8 (SLC39A8) is a transmembrane divalent metal ion importer that is most highly expressed in the lung and is inducible by inflammatory stimuli. In addition to zinc and manganese, ZIP8 can transport iron but its specific roles in iron regulation during homeostatic and pathologic processes remain poorly understood. Using a novel global inducible ZIP8 knockout (KO) mouse, we analyzed the role of ZIP8 in steady-state iron homeostasis and during inflammation and infection. We observed an unexpected phenotype of elevated spleen iron levels and decreased serum iron in ZIP8 KO mice, suggesting that ZIP8 plays a role in iron recycling. We also showed that ZIP8 is expressed on lung distal airspace epithelial cells and transports iron from the airway into lung tissue. LPS-induced inflammation induced ZIP8 expression in the lung, but ZIP8 deletion had no detrimental effect on the severity of LPS-induced acute lung injury or on the outcomes of &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; lung infection. Thus, ZIP8 plays a role in systemic iron homeostasis but does not modulate the severity of inflammatory lung injury or the host defense against a common bacterial cause of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA-VO-ME was successfully prepared with greater bioavailability (214%) than CA-VO in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA-VO-ME reduced the LPS-induced increase in levels of NO, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS and COX-2 in vitro and/or in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA-VO-ME had powerful effect on ameliorating the histopathological changes, prolonging the survival of ALI mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA-VO-ME exerted a better effect on ALI than CA-VO, suggesting that CA-VO-ME is a promising drug for the treatment of ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI), a clinical syndrome of acute respiratory failure due to acute lung inflammation, remains a substantial public health problem in the worldwide. Ligusticum Chuanxiong Rhizoma and Angelicae Sinensis Radix was herb-pair of the traditional Chinese medicine. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that volatile oil extracted from Chuanxiong Rhizome and Angelicae Sinensis Radix is identified as an important active ingredient, which has good antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, whether their volatile oil combination (CA-VO), has effects on the prevention and treatment of ALI has not been reported yet. Due to poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability of CA-VO, CA -VO-loaded microemulsion (CA-VO-ME) was formulated to enhance its oral bioavailability. The physical properties of CA-VO-ME were characterized. The pharmacokinetic parameters and the effect on ALI were evaluated. The particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of CA-VO-ME were 20.19 ± 0.08 nm, 0.091 ± 0.01, 36.33 ± 4.29%, and 93.75%, respectively. CA-VO-ME had a greater bioavailability (214%) than CA-VO. CA-VO-ME reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increase in levels of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in vitro and/or in vivo. Moreover, CA-VO-ME treatment notably decreased the lung index, ameliorated histopathological changes and prolonged the survival of ALI mice. By comparison, CA-VO-ME exerted a better effect on ALI than CA-VO, suggesting that CA-VO-ME is a promising drug for the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gallic, ellagic acids and their oral combined administration induce kidney, lung, and heart injury after acute exposure in Wistar rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36272503/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallic (GA) and ellagic (EA) acids are present in foods, medicinal plants, teas, and dietary supplements. An acute toxicological study was conducted by oral administration of both compounds alone (200, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg) and combined (2000 mg/kg) and their effects on the electron transport chain (ETC) and the ROS production in kidney mitochondria further evaluated. All treatments induced a dose-dependent heart, lung, and kidney injury. However, the intensity of these effects varied according to the substance, with greater cardiac and renal toxicity for EA and pulmonary injury for GA, while the combination attenuated the toxicity of the isolated molecules. All substances inhibited the activity of complexes II, III, and IV of the ETC from renal mitochondria. However, no changes were observed regarding mitochondrial ROS production. These compounds have a non-negligible inherent deleterious potential, so their uncontrolled use at high doses (≥200 mg/kg) could cause undesirable effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of ferroptosis and iron accumulation alleviates pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin model</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive disease characterized by excessive proliferation of fibroblasts and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by the lethal accumulation of iron and lipid peroxidation, which is associated with many diseases. Our study addressed the potential role played by ferroptosis and iron accumulation in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. We found that the inducers of pulmonary fibrosis and injury, namely, bleomycin (BLM) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induced ferroptosis of lung epithelial cells. Both the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1) and the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) alleviated the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin or LPS. TGF-β stimulation upregulated the expression of transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC) in the human lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) and mouse primary lung fibroblasts, resulting in increased intracellular Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which promoted the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Mechanistically, TGF-β enhanced the expression and nuclear localization of the transcriptional coactivator tafazzin (TAZ), which combined with the transcription factor TEA domain protein (TEAD)-4 to promote the transcription of TFRC. In addition, elevated Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; failed to induce the ferroptosis of fibroblasts, which might be related to the regulation of iron export and lipid metabolism. Finally, we specifically knocked out TFRC expression in fibroblasts in mice, and compared with those in the control mice, the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis were reduced in the knockout mice after bleomycin induction. Collectively, these findings suggest the therapeutic potential of ferroptosis inhibitors and iron chelators in treating pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microvascular lung injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress in systemic lupus erythematosus-associated alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary vasculitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36255715/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human &lt;em&gt;COPA&lt;/em&gt; mutations affecting retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein transport cause diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and ER stress (&amp;ldquo;COPA syndrome&amp;rdquo;). Patients with SLE also can develop DAH. C57BL/6 (B6) mice with pristane-induced lupus develop monocyte-dependent DAH indistinguishable from human DAH, whereas BALB/c mice are resistant. We examined Copa and ER stress in pristane-induced lupus. &lt;em&gt;Copa&lt;/em&gt; expression, ER stress, vascular injury, and apoptosis were assessed in mice and &lt;em&gt;COPA&lt;/em&gt; was quantified in blood from patients with SLE. &lt;em&gt;Copa&lt;/em&gt; mRNA and protein expression were impaired in B6 mice with pristane-induced DAH, but not in pristane-treated BALB/c mice. An ER stress response (increased &lt;em&gt;Hsp5a&lt;/em&gt;/BiP, &lt;em&gt;Ddit3&lt;/em&gt;/CHOP, &lt;em&gt;Eif2a&lt;/em&gt;, and spliced &lt;em&gt;Xbp1&lt;/em&gt;) was seen in lungs from pristane-treated B6, but not BALB/c, mice. Resistance of BALB/c mice to DAH was overcome by treating them with low-dose thapsigargin plus pristane. CB6F1 mice did not develop DAH or ER stress, suggesting that susceptibility was recessive. Increased pulmonary expression of von Willebrand factor (&lt;em&gt;Vwf&lt;/em&gt;), a marker of endothelial injury, and the chemokine &lt;em&gt;Ccl2&lt;/em&gt; in DAH suggested that pristane promotes lung microvascular injury and monocyte recruitment. Consistent with that possibility, lung endothelial cells and infiltrating bone marrow-derived cells from pristane-treated B6 mice expressed BiP and showed evidence of apoptosis (annexin-V and activated caspase-3 staining). &lt;em&gt;COPA&lt;/em&gt; expression also was low in patients with SLE with lung involvement. Pristane-induced DAH may be initiated by endothelial injury, resulting in ER stress, apoptosis of lung endothelial cells, and recruitment of myeloid cells that propagate lung injury. The pathogenesis of DAH in SLE and COPA syndrome may overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astaxanthin attenuates ferroptosis via Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways in LPS-induced acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin prevents against LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin attenuates ferroptosis against lps-induced acute lung injury by Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a form of regulated nonapoptotic cell death associated with iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Previous studies have shown that ferroptosis is involved in the occurrence and development of acute lung injury (ALI). In this study, a systems pharmacology approach was performed through the overall process of target acquisition, network construction, and further analysis. Then, the effects of astaxanthin on LPS-induced inflammation and ferroptosis were investigated in RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS in vitro and ALI mice induced by LPS in vivo. The enrichment analysis of astaxanthin-target gene is closely related to the occurrence and development mechanism of ferroptosis. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of astaxanthin acting on ALI found that these intersection genes are associated with ALI inflammatory pathway. In addition, astaxanthin can effectively inhibit LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ferroptosis in RAW264.7 cells. Consistently, administration of astaxanthin protected mice against LPS-induced ALI and significantly decreased the extent of lung edema, inflammatory cells infiltration, and ferroptosis in vivo, and Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is involved in astaxanthin inhibits LPS-induced ALI and ferroptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that astaxanthin inhibit inflammation and ferroptosis by regulating Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to reduce LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 protects PM2.5 exposure-induced lung injury in mice by repressing inflammation and oxidative stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36242005/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Airborne fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) pollution is associated with the prevalence of respiratory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In patients with those diseases, circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels are increased, which contributes to airway nitric oxide deficiency, oxidative stress and inflammation. Overexpression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1), an enzyme degrading ADMA, exerts protective effects in animal models. However, the impact of DDAH1/ADMA on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and DDAH1-transgenic mice, as well as their respective wild-type (WT) littermates, were exposed to either filtered air or airborne PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; (mean daily concentration ~ 50 µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for 6 months through a whole-body exposure system. Mice were also acutely exposed to 10 mg/kg PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and/or exogenous ADMA (2 mg/kg) via intratracheal instillation every other day for 2 weeks. Inflammatory response, oxidative stress and related gene expressions in the lungs were examined. In addition, RAW264.7 cells were exposed to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and/or ADMA and the changes in intracellular oxidative stress and inflammatory response were determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice developed more severe lung injury than WT mice after long-term PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, which was associated with greater induction of pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation. In the lungs of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed mice, &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency increased protein expression of p-p65, iNOS and Bax, and decreased protein expression of Bcl-2, SOD1 and peroxiredoxin 4. Conversely, DDAH1 overexpression significantly alleviated lung injury, attenuated pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation, and exerted opposite effects on those proteins in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed mice. In addition, exogenous ADMA administration could mimic the effect of &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury, oxidative stress and inflammation. In PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed macrophages, ADMA aggravated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in an iNOS-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our data revealed that DDAH1 has a marked protective effect on long-term PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interplay between mucus mobility and alveolar macrophage targeting of surface-modified liposomes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36209941/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alveolar macrophages play a crucial role in the initiation and resolution of the immune response in the lungs. Pro-inflammatory M1 alveolar macrophages are an interesting target for treating inflammatory and infectious pulmonary diseases. One commune targeting strategy is to use nanoparticles conjugated with hyaluronic acid, which interact with CD44 overexpressed on the membrane of those cells. Unfortunately, this coating strategy may be countered by the presence on the surface of the nanoparticles of a poly(ethylene glycol) corona employed to improve nanoparticles&amp;rsquo; diffusion in the lung mucus. This study aims to measure this phenomenon by comparing the behavior in a murine lung inflammation model of three liposomal platforms designed to represent different poly(ethylene glycol) and hyaluronic acid densities (Liposome-PEG, Liposome-PEG-HA and Liposome-HA). In this work, the liposomes were obtained by a one-step ethanol injection method. Their interaction with mucin and targeting ability toward pro-inflammatory macrophages were then investigated in vitro and in vivo in a LPS model of lung inflammation. In vitro, poly(ethylene glycol) free HA-liposomes display a superior targeting efficiency toward M1 macrophages, while the addition of poly(ethylene glycol) induces better mucus mobility. Interestingly in vivo studies revealed that the three liposomes showed distinct cell specificity with alveolar macrophages demonstrating an avidity for poly(ethylene glycol) free HA-liposomes, while neutrophils favored PEGylated liposomes exempt of HA. Those results could be explained by the presence of two forces exercising a balance between mucus penetration and receptor targeting. This study corroborates the importance of considering the site of action and the targeted cells when designing nanoparticles to treat lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modulatory effects of 17β-estradiol on acute lung inflammation after total occlusion of the descending aorta in male rats</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aortic ischemia and reperfusion leads to lung inflammatory activation with edema and leukocyte infiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E2 preventive effects include decreasing of edema, iNOS expression and preventing leukocyte infiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E2 is able to prevent the increased expression of ET-1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our study can be considered is one more step towards using E2 to prevent the local and remote inflammatory response after descending thoracic aorta cross-clamping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of systemic inflammation caused by ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) due to aortic occlusion, the lungs can exhibit increased microvascular permeability, local release of pro-inflammatory mediators, and leukocyte infiltration. Lung tissue infiltration by activated neutrophils is followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is linked to acute pulmonary microvascular damage, high mortality rates, and organ dysfunction. Previous studies have demonstrated that female sex hormones modulate the inflammatory response and that prophylactic treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2) can prevent fatalities and preserve mesenteric perfusion and intestinal integrity after ischemia/reperfusion induced by aortic occlusion. In this study, we focused on the protective effects of estradiol after aortic ischemia/reperfusion by evaluating lung injury and endothelial alterations. Upon anesthesia and mechanical ventilation, male rats were subjected to aortic occlusion for 20 min, followed by 2 h of reperfusion. In parallel, one group of rats received a single injection of estradiol (280 µg/kg, i.v.) 30 min before ischemia. We observed increased serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 in the I/R rats and E2 was able to reduce them. E2 effects after 2 h of reperfusion resulted mainly in decreasing of edema, iNOS expression and preventing leukocyte infiltration. Overall, our data indicate that estradiol might be a supplementary approach to deal with systemic processes and lung deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New mechanism for mesenchymal stem cell microvesicle to restore lung permeability: intracellular S1P signaling pathway independent of S1P receptor-1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36209115/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Microvesicles (MVs) derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) were demonstrated to restore lung protein permeability and attenuate acute lung injury. In our previous study, we found that MSC MV increased sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) kinase1 mRNA levels in injured human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC) significantly. However, the role of S1P signaling in MSC MV to restore lung protein permeability is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we hypothesized that MSC MV might restore lung permeability in part through increasing intracellular S1P signaling pathway in injured HLMVEC independent of S1P receptors. We used the transwell co-culture system to study the effect of MSC MV on protein permeability of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) damaged HLMVEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our results showed that LPS significantly increased the permeability of HLMVEC to FITC-dextran (70 kDa) within 24 h. MSC MV restores this permeability and, to a large extent, prevents the cytoskeleton protein F-actin from recombining into &amp;ldquo;actin stress fibers,&amp;rdquo; and restores the positions of tight junctions and adhesion junctions in the damaged HLMVEC. This therapeutic effect of MSC MV was related to the increase in the S1P level in injured HLMVEC and was not eliminated when adding the antagonist of S1P receptor, suggesting that MSC MV to restore lung permeability was independent of S1P receptors on HLMVEC. Laser confocal further observed that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mobilization and Rac1 activation in LPS injured HLMVEC were increased in parallel with the increase in intracellular S1P level after MSC MV treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In short, MSC MV partially restored protein permeability across HLMVEC through the intracellular S1P signaling pathway independent of S1P receptor-1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiota-derived succinate aggravates acute lung injury after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36229053/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Gut microbiota and their metabolic byproducts act as important modulators of the gut-lung axis. This study aimed to define the role of succinate, a key microbiota metabolite, in intestinal I/R-induced ALI progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Gut and lung microbiota of mice subjected to intestinal I/R were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Succinate level alterations were measured in Germ-free (GF) mice or conventional mice treated with antibiotics. Succinate-induced alveolar macrophage polarisation and its effects on alveolar epithelial apoptosis were evaluated in succinate receptor1 (&lt;em&gt;Sucnr1&lt;/em&gt;)-deficient mice and in murine alveolar macrophages transfected with &lt;em&gt;Sucnr1&lt;/em&gt;-siRNA. Succinate levels were measured in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, including intestinal I/R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Succinate accumulated in lungs after intestinal I/R, and this was associated with an imbalance of succinate-producing and succinate-consuming bacteria in the gut, but not the lungs. Succinate accumulation was absent in GF mice and was reversed by gut microbiota depletion with antibiotics, indicating that gut microbiota are a source of lung succinate. Moreover, succinate promoted alveolar macrophage polarisation, alveolar epithelial apoptosis, and lung injury during intestinal I/R. Conversely, knockdown of &lt;em&gt;Sucnr1&lt;/em&gt; or blockage of SUCNR1 &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; reversed the effects of succinate by modulating PI3K-AKT/HIF-1α pathway. Plasma succinate levels significantly correlated with intestinal I/R-related lung injury after cardiopulmonary bypass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Gut microbiota-derived succinate exacerbates intestinal I/R-induced ALI through SUCNR1-dependent alveolar macrophage polarisation, identifying succinate as a novel target for gut-derived ALI in critically ill patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is the primary cause of death among patients with acute paraquat (PQ) poisoning, whereby peroxidative damage is an important mechanism underlying PQ-induced lung injury. There is a lack of effective interventional drugs for patients with PQ poisoning. Oxaloacetic acid (OAA) participates in multiple &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; metabolic processes, whereby it facilitates the clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improves mitochondrial function. The study aimed to assess the protective effects of OAA on PQ-induced ALI and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. Our data demonstrated that OAA treatment significantly alleviated PQ-induced ALI and improved the survival rate of PQ-poisoned mice, and also alleviated PQ-induced cellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. OAA-mediated alleviation of PQ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction depends on the following mechanisms which may explain the above findings: 1) OAA effectively cleared intracellular ROS, inhibited ROS accumulation, and mitochondrial depolarization; 2) OAA inhibited the downregulation of L-OPA1 and MFN2 caused by PQ and promoted a dynamic balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission, and 3) the expression of PGC-1α, TFAM, COX2, and COX4I1, increased significantly following OAA intervention which improved mitochondrial respiratory functions and promoted its biogenesis and energy metabolism in damaged cells. In conclusion, OAA effectively cleared ROS and improved mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby significantly improving ALI caused by PQ poisoning and the animal survival rate. Therefore, OAA may be a potential drug for the treatment of PQ poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We engineered an ultrasensitive reporter of p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a&lt;/sup&gt;, a biomarker of cellular senescence. Our reporter detected p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a&lt;/sup&gt;-expressing fibroblasts with certain senescent characteristics that appeared shortly after birth in the basement membrane adjacent to epithelial stem cells in the lung. Furthermore, these p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a+&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts had enhanced capacity to sense tissue inflammation and respond through their increased secretory capacity to promote epithelial regeneration. In addition, p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a&lt;/sup&gt; expression was required in fibroblasts to enhance epithelial regeneration. This study highlights a role for p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a+&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts as tissue-resident sentinels in the stem cell niche that monitor barrier integrity and rapidly respond to inflammation to promote tissue regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In-line miniature 3D-printed pressure-cycled ventilator maintains respiratory homeostasis in swine with induced acute pulmonary injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the need for inexpensive, easy-to-use, rapidly mass-produced resuscitation devices that could be quickly distributed in areas of critical need. In-line miniature ventilators based on principles of fluidics ventilate patients by automatically oscillating between forced inspiration and assisted expiration as airway pressure changes, requiring only a continuous supply of pressurized oxygen. Here, we designed three miniature ventilator models to operate in specific pressure ranges along a continuum of clinical lung injury (mild, moderate, and severe injury). Three-dimensional (3D)-printed prototype devices evaluated in a lung simulator generated airway pressures, tidal volumes, and minute ventilation within the targeted range for the state of lung disease each was designed to support. In testing in domestic swine before and after induction of pulmonary injury, the ventilators for mild and moderate injury met the design criteria when matched with the appropriate degree of lung injury. Although the ventilator for severe injury provided the specified design pressures, respiratory rate was elevated with reduced minute ventilation, a result of lung compliance below design parameters. Respiratory rate reflected how well each ventilator matched the injury state of the lungs and could guide selection of ventilator models in clinical use. This simple device could help mitigate shortages of conventional ventilators during pandemics and other disasters requiring rapid access to advanced airway management, or in transport applications for hands-free ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-1249 on Endothelial Extracellular Vesicles Mediates Cigarette Smoke-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension by Inhibiting HDAC10 (Histone Deacetylase 10)-NFκB (Nuclear Factor κB)-CaSR (Calcium-Sensing Receptor) Cascade</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Overproduction of endothelial extracellular vesicles (eEVs) is correlated with pulmonary hypertension progression, but the precise mechanism remains largely unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; MicroRNA-chip and real-time polymerase chain reaction were conducted to screen and validate microRNA profiles in blood plasma eEVs of rats and human with or without cigarette smoking. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were cultured to study signaling pathways. Pulmonary hypertension phenotypes were evaluated in wild-type and calcium-sensing receptor knockout rats to identify the pathophysiological significance of the microRNA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MicroR-1249 was predominant highly expressed in eEVs from plasma of rats exposed to cigarette smoking, and confirmed in eEVs from plasma of human smokers as well as in eEVs from cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery endothelial cells, but not in cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. In cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, microR-1249 downregulated the expression of histone deacetylase 10, which in turn enhanced the acetylated form of NFκB (nuclear factor κB) level and its nuclear translocation leading to increased expression of calcium-sensing receptor. In rats, the repression of microR-1249 in eEVs by microR-1249 inhibitor, histone deacetylase 10 overexpression, or calcium-sensing receptor knockout profoundly inhibited the proliferative capacities and diminished apoptosis-resistance of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and pulmonary hypertension development in rats intravenously administrated with eEVs preparation from cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Cigarette smoke-enriched microR-1249 in endothelial extracellular vesicles facilitates the hyperproliferative and antiapoptotic status of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells promoting pulmonary hypertension evolution through the inhibition of histone deacetylase 10-NFκB-calcium-sensing receptor cascade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Precise Monitoring and Assessing Treatment Response of Sepsis-Induced Acute Lung Hypoxia with a Nitroreductase-Activated Golgi-Targetable Fluorescent Probe</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36223488/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is mostly attributed to an outbreak of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which makes leukocytes infiltrate into the lung and results in lung hypoxia. Nitroreductase (NTR) is significantly upregulated under hypoxia, which is commonly regarded as a potential biomarker for assessing sepsis-induced acute lung hypoxia. Increasing evidence shows that NTR in the Golgi apparatus could be induced in sepsis-induced ALI. Meanwhile, the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor (dimethyloxalylglycine, DMOG) attenuated sepsis-induced ALI through further increasing the level of Golgi NTR by improving hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activity, but as yet, no Golgi-targetable probe has been developed for monitoring and assessing treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI. Herein, we report a Golgi-targetable probe, Gol-NTR, for monitoring and assessing treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI through mapping the generation of NTR. The probe displayed high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 54.8 ng/mL and good selectivity to NTR. In addition, due to the excellent characteristics of Golgi-targetable, Gol-NTR was successfully applied in mapping the change of Golgi NTR in cells and zebrafish caused by various stimuli. Most importantly, the production of Golgi NTR in the sepsis-induced ALI and the PHD inhibitor (DMOG) against sepsis-induced ALI were visualized and precisely assessed for the first time with the assistance of Gol-NTR. The results demonstrated the practicability of Gol-NTR for the precise monitoring and assessing of the personalized treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schisandrin B protects against LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury by targeting MyD88</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36270224/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a challenging clinical syndrome that manifests as an acute inflammatory response. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a bioactive lignan from Schisandra genus plants, has been shown to suppress inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypothesis/purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study performed an in-depth investigation of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Sch B in macrophages and in an animal model of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; qPCR array was used to probe the differential effects and potential target of Sch B. ALI was induced by intratracheal administration of LPS in experimental mice with or without Sch B treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our studies show that Sch B differentially modulates inflammatory factor induction by LPS in macrophages by directly binding myeloid differentiation response factor-88 (MyD88), an essential adaptor protein in the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) pathway. Sch B spares non-MyD88-pathways downstream of TLR4. Such inhibition suppressed key signaling mediators such as TAK1, MAPKs, and NF-κB, and pro-inflammatory factor induction. Pull down assay using biotinylated-Sch B validate the direct interaction between Sch B and MyD88 in macrophages. Treatment of mice with Sch B prior to LPS challenge reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in lungs, induction of MyD88-pathway signaling proteins, and prevented inflammatory cytokine induction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, our studies have identified MyD88 as a direct target of Sch B for its anti-inflammatory activity, and suggest that Sch B may have therapeutic value for acute lung injury and other MyD88-dependent inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C-X-C-Chemokine-Receptor-Type-4 Inhibitor AMD3100 Attenuates Pulmonary Inflammation and Fibrosis in Silicotic Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36238768/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Silicosis is a severe pulmonary disease caused by inhaling dust containing crystalline silica. The progression of silicosis to pulmonary fibrosis is usually unavoidable. Recent studies have revealed positivity for the overexpression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in pulmonary fibrosis and shown that the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 attenuated pulmonary fibrosis after bleomycin challenge and paraquat exposure. However, it is unclear whether AMD3100 reduces crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 male mice were instilled intranasally with a single dose of crystalline silica (12 mg/60 μL) to establish an acute silicosis mouse model. Twelve hours later, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg AMD3100 or control solution. Then, the mice were weighed daily and sacrificed on day 7, 14, or 28 to collect lung tissue and peripheral blood. Western blotting was also applied to determine the level of CXCR4, while different histological techniques were used to assess pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In addition, the level of B cells in peripheral blood was measured by flow cytometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 were upregulated in the lung tissues of crystalline silica-exposed mice. Blocking CXCR4 with AMD3100 suppressed the upregulation of CXCR4/CXCL12, reduced the severity of lung injury, and prevented weight loss. It also inhibited neutrophil infiltration at inflammatory sites and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, as well as reduced B-lymphocyte aggregates in the lung. Additionally, it decreased the recruitment of circulating fibrocytes (CD45+collagen I+CXCR4+) to the lung and the deposition of collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin in lung tissue. AMD3100 also increased the level of B cells in peripheral blood, preventing circulating B cells from migrating to the injured lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Blocking CXCR4 with AMD3100 delays pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in a silicosis mouse model, suggesting the potential of AMD3100 as a drug for treating silicosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung epithelium development and airway regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36299482/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lung is composed of a highly branched airway structure, which humidifies and warms the inhaled air before entering the alveolar compartment. In the alveoli, a thin layer of epithelium is in close proximity with the capillary endothelium, allowing for an efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. During development proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells generates the lung architecture, and in the adult lung a proper function of progenitor cells is needed to regenerate after injury. Malfunctioning of progenitors during development results in various congenital lung disorders, such as Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) and Congenital Pulmonary Adenomatoid Malformation (CPAM). In addition, many premature neonates experience continuous insults on the lung caused by artificial ventilation and supplemental oxygen, which requires a highly controlled mechanism of airway repair. Malfunctioning of airway progenitors during regeneration can result in reduction of respiratory function or (chronic) airway diseases. Pathways that are active during development are frequently re-activated upon damage. Understanding the basic mechanisms of lung development and the behavior of progenitor cell in the ontogeny and regeneration of the lung may help to better understand the underlying cause of lung diseases, especially those occurring in prenatal development or in the immediate postnatal period of life. This review provides an overview of lung development and the cell types involved in repair of lung damage with a focus on the airway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing in the elderly. COPD is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway remodeling and alveolar emphysema. COPD patients are also at high risk for mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. &lt;em&gt;Ninjin&amp;rsquo;yoeito&lt;/em&gt; (NYT) is prescribed to patients with conditions such as post-illness and postoperative weakness, fatigue, poor appetite, skin rash, cold hands and feet, and anemia. In addition to traditional uses, NYT is also prescribed as a therapeutic drug for poor functioning of the digestive organs, respiratory organs, and urinary organs. NYT is also known to have an antioxidant effect. The objective of this study was to investigate whether NYT could ameliorate COPD-induced lung injury and anxiety/depression in aged C57BL/6J mice exposed to porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE). While intratracheal administration of PPE induced emphysema in elderly mice, long-term administration of NYT suppressed the pathology. NYT was also found to suppress the apoptosis and oxidative stress caused by PPE. In addition, long-term administration of NYT was found to ameliorate PPE-induced depressive-like behavior in three different behavioral studies. These results suggest that NYT has a therapeutic effect on emphysema and the behavioral abnormalities caused by PPE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sulforaphane alleviated vascular remodeling in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension via inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36220525/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH) is a cardiopulmonary disease featured by pulmonary vascular remodeling, which is due to abnormal proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and dysfunction of endothelial cells (ECs). Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural isothiocyanate extracted from cruciferous vegetables with promising anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of SFN on HPH. Male mice were exposed to persistent chronic hypoxia for 4 weeks to induce HPH. The results demonstrated that SFN repressed the increased right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and attenuated the right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary arteries remodeling in HPH mice. In particular, after SFN treatment, the CD68 positive cells in lung sections were reduced; TNF-α and IL-6 levels in lungs and serum declined; activation of NF-κB in PASMCs was inhibited in response to hypoxia. Besides, SFN enhanced the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum, SOD2 expression, total glutathione levels, and GSH/GSSG ratio in PASMCs, along with a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in serum and ROS production in PASMCs after hypoxia exposure. Notably, SFN, as an Nrf2 activator, reversed the reduction in Nrf2 expression in hypoxic PASMCs. In vitro, SFN treatment inhibited hyperproliferation and promoted apoptosis of PASMCs under hypoxia conditions. SFN also prevented the apoptosis of pulmonary microvascular ECs caused by hypoxia. Therefore, these data suggested that SFN could significantly restrain the inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting PASMCs proliferation, promoting PASMCs apoptosis, and reversing hypoxia injury in ECs to improve pulmonary vascular remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distinct roles of ORAI1 in T cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation and immunity to influenza A virus infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T cell activation and function depend on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals mediated by store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE) through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release-activated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (CRAC) channels formed by ORAI1 proteins. We here investigated how SOCE controls T cell function in pulmonary inflammation during a T helper 1 (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1) cell-mediated response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation. T cell-specific deletion of &lt;em&gt;Orai1&lt;/em&gt; did not exacerbate pulmonary inflammation and viral burdens following IAV infection but protected mice from house dust mite-induced allergic airway inflammation. ORAI1 controlled the expression of genes including p53 and E2F transcription factors that regulate the cell cycle in T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells in response to allergen stimulation and the expression of transcription factors and cytokines that regulate T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell function. Systemic application of a CRAC channel blocker suppressed allergic airway inflammation without compromising immunity to IAV infection, suggesting that inhibition of SOCE is a potential treatment for allergic airway disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2,3,5,4&#39;-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside ameliorates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via regulating pro-fibrotic signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36267283/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2,3,5,4&amp;rsquo;-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-Glucoside (THSG) is the main active ingredient extracted from &lt;em&gt;Polygonum multiflorum&lt;/em&gt; Thunb. (PMT), which has been reported to possess extensive pharmacological properties. Nevertheless, the exact role of THSG in pulmonary fibrosis has not been demonstrated yet. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of THSG against bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis in a murine model, and explore the underlying mechanisms of THSG in transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)-induced fibrogenesis using MRC-5 human lung fibroblast cells. We found that THSG significantly attenuated lung injury by reducing fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition. THSG treatment significantly downregulated the expression levels of TGF-β1, fibronectin, α-SMA, CTGF, and TGFBR2, however, upregulated the expression levels of antioxidants (SOD-1 and catalase) and LC3B in the lungs of BLM-treated mice. THSG treatment decreased the expression levels of fibronectin, α-SMA, and CTGF in TGF-β1-stimulated MRC-5 cells. Conversely, THSG increased the expression levels of SOD-1 and catalase. Furthermore, treatment of THSG profoundly reduced the TGF-β1-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, THSG restored TGF-β1-induced impaired autophagy, accompany by increasing the protein levels of LC3B-II and Beclin 1. Mechanism study indicated that THSG significantly reduced TGF-β1-induced increase of TGFBR2 expression and phosphorylation of Smad2/3, Akt, mTOR, and ERK1/2 in MRC-5 cells. These findings suggest that THSG may be considered as an anti-fibrotic drug for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electronic cigarette vaping with aged coils causes acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36195745/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been used widely as an alternative to conventional cigarettes and have become particularly popular among young adults. A growing body of evidence has shown that e-cigarettes are associated with acute lung injury and adverse effects in multiple other organs. Previous studies showed that high emissions of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) in aerosols were associated with increased usage of the same e-cigarette coils. However, the impact on lung function of using aged coils has not been reported. We investigated the relationship between coil age and acute lung injury in mice exposed to experimental vaping for 1 h (2 puffs/min, 100 ml/puff). The e-liquid contains propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (50:50, vol) only. The concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in the vaping aerosols increased with age of the nichrome coils starting at 1200 puffs. Mice exposed to e-cigarette aerosols produced from 1800, but not 0 or 900, puff-aged coils caused acute lung injury, increased lung wet/dry weight ratio, and induced lung inflammation (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP-2). Exposure to vaping aerosols from 1800 puff-aged coils decreased heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation in mice compared to mice exposed to air or aerosols from new coils. In conclusion, we observed that the concentration of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) increased with repeated and prolonged usage of e-cigarette coils. Exposure to high levels of aldehyde in vaping aerosol was associated with acute lung injury in mice. These findings show significant risk of lung injury associated with prolonged use of e-cigarette devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A-Kinase Anchor Protein 1 deficiency causes mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse model of hyperoxia induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36263130/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Critically ill patients on supplemental oxygen therapy eventually develop acute lung injury (ALI). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during ALI perturbs the mitochondrial dynamics resulting in cellular damage. Genetic deletion of the mitochondrial A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (Akap1) in mice resulted in mitochondrial damage, Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, increased expression of mitophagy proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines, exacerbating hyperoxia-induced Acute Lung Injury (HALI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Despite a strong causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction and HALI, the mechanisms governing the disease progression at the transcriptome level is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was carried out using the lungs of Akap1 knockout (&lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice exposed to normoxia or 48 h of hyperoxia followed by quantitative real time PCR and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Western blot analysis assessed mitochondrial dysfunction, OXPHOS complex (I-V), apoptosis and antioxidant proteins. Mitochondrial enzymatic assays was used to measure the aconitase, fumarase, citrate synthase activities in isolated mitochondria from &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; vs. Wt mice exposed to hyperoxia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Transcriptome analysis of &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; exposed to hyperoxia reveals increases in transcripts encoding electron transport chain (ETC) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) proteins. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) shows enrichment of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation in &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Loss of AKAP1, coupled with oxidant injury, significantly decreases the activities of TCA enzymes. Mechanistically, a significant loss of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) phosphorylation at the protein kinase A (PKA) site Serine 637 (Ser637), decreases in Akt phosphorylation at Serine 437 (Ser47) and increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax indicate mitochondrial dysfunction. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels significantly increased in CD68 positive alveolar macrophages in &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lungs, suggesting a strong antioxidant response to hyperoxia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Overall these results suggest that AKAP1 overexpression and modulation of Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser637 is an important therapeutic strategy for acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reprogramming alveolar macrophage responses to TGF-β reveals CCR2&#43; monocyte activity that promotes bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36189800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a major impediment to lung transplant survival and is generally resistant to medical therapy. Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy that shows promise in stabilizing BOS patients, but its mechanisms of action are unclear. In a mouse lung transplant model, we show that ECP blunts alloimmune responses and inhibits BOS through lowering airway TGF-β bioavailability without altering its expression. Surprisingly, ECP-treated leukocytes were primarily engulfed by alveolar macrophages (AMs), which were reprogrammed to become less responsive to TGF-β and reduce TGF-β bioavailability through secretion of the TGF-β antagonist decorin. In untreated recipients, high airway TGF-β activity stimulated AMs to express CCL2, leading to CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocyte-driven BOS development. Moreover, we found TGF-β receptor 2-dependent differentiation of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes was required for the generation of monocyte-derived AMs, which in turn promoted BOS by expanding tissue-resident memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells that inflicted airway injury through Blimp-1-mediated granzyme B expression. Thus, through studying the effects of ECP, we have identified an AM functional plasticity that controls a TGF-β-dependent network that couples CCR2+ monocyte recruitment and differentiation to alloimmunity and BOS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The mitochondrial calcium uniporter of pulmonary type 2 cells determines severity of acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute Lung Injury (ALI) due to inhaled pathogens causes high mortality. Underlying mechanisms are inadequately understood. Here, by optical imaging of live mouse lungs we show that a key mechanism is the viability of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering by the mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uniporter (MCU) in the lung&amp;rsquo;s surfactant-secreting, alveolar type 2 cells (AT2). The buffering increased mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and induced surfactant secretion in wild-type mice, but not in mice with AT2-specific MCU knockout. In the knockout mice, ALI due to intranasal LPS instillation caused severe pulmonary edema and mortality, which were mitigated by surfactant replenishment prior to LPS instillation, indicating surfactant&amp;rsquo;s protective effect against alveolar edema. In wild-type mice, intranasal LPS, or &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; decreased AT2 MCU. Loss of MCU abrogated buffering. The resulting mortality was reduced by spontaneous recovery of MCU expression, or by MCU replenishment. Enhancement of AT2 mitochondrial buffering, hence endogenous surfactant secretion, through MCU replenishment might be a therapy against ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aberrant methylation of Serpine1 mediates lung injury in neonatal mice prenatally exposed to intrauterine inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36183130/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36183130/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Intrauterine inflammation (IUI) alters epigenetic modifications in offspring, leading to lung injury. However, the epigenetic mechanism underlying IUI-induced lung injury remains uncertain. In the present study, we aim to investigate the effect of IUI on lung development, and to identify the key molecule involved in this process and its epigenetic regulatory mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Serpine1 was upregulated in the lung tissue of neonatal mice with IUI. Intranasal delivery of Serpine1 siRNA markedly reversed IUI-induced lung injury. Serpine1 overexpression substantially promoted cell senescence of both human and murine lung epithelial cells, reflected by decreased cell proliferation and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, G0/G1 cell fraction, senescence marker, and oxidative and DNA damage marker expression. IUI decreased the methylation level of the Serpine1 promoter, and methylation of the promoter led to transcriptional repression of Serpine1. Furthermore, IUI promoted the expression of Tet1 potentially through TNF-α, while Tet1 facilitated the demethylation of Serpine1 promoter. DNA pull-down and ChIP assays revealed that the Serpine1 promoter was regulated by Rela and Hdac2. DNA demethylation increased the recruitment of Rela to the Serpine1 promoter and induced the release of Hdac2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Increased Serpine1 expression mediated by DNA demethylation causes lung injury in neonatal mice with IUI. Therefore, therapeutic interventions targeting Serpine1 may effectively prevent IUI-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblast growth factor 10 attenuates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by protecting against glycocalyx impairment and endothelial apoptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36183124/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The defects and imbalance in lung repair and structural maintenance contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), yet the molecular mechanisms that regulate lung repair process are so far incompletely understood. We hypothesized that cigarette smoking causes glycocalyx impairment and endothelial apoptosis in COPD, which could be repaired by the stimulation of fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10)/FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used immunostaining (immunohistochemical [IHC] and immunofluorescence [IF]) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the levels of glycocalyx components and endothelial apoptosis in animal models and in patients with COPD. We used the murine emphysema model and in vitro studies to determine the protective and reparative role of FGF10/FGFR1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Exposure to cigarette smoke caused endothelial glycocalyx impairment and emphysematous changes in murine models and human specimens. Pretreatment of FGF10 attenuated the development of emphysema and the shedding of glycocalyx components induced by CSE &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. However, FGF10 did not attenuate the emphysema induced by endothelial-specific killing peptide CGSPGWVRC-GG-&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;(KLAKLAK)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Mechanistically, FGF10 alleviated smoke-induced endothelial apoptosis and glycocalyx repair through FGFR1/ERK/SOX9/HS6ST1 signaling &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. FGF10 was shown to repair pulmonary glycocalyx injury and endothelial apoptosis, and attenuate smoke-induced COPD through FGFR1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results suggest that FGF10 may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy against COPD via endothelial repair and glycocalyx reconstitution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hedgehog pathway and its inhibitors in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COPD affects millions of people and is now ranked as the third leading cause of death worldwide. This largely untreatable chronic airway disease results in irreversible destruction of lung architecture. The small lung hypothesis is now supported by epidemiological, physiological and clinical studies. Accordingly, the early and severe COPD phenotype carries the most dreadful prognosis and finds its roots during lung growth. Pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood and implicate individual susceptibility (genetics), a large part of environmental factors (viral infections, tobacco consumption, air pollution) and the combined effects of those triggers on gene expression. Genetic susceptibility is most likely involved as the disease is severe and starts early in life. The latter observation led to the identification of Mendelian inheritance via disease-causing variants of SERPINA1 - known as the basis for alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and TERT. In the last two decades multiple genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with COPD. High significance SNPs are located in 4q31 near HHIP which encodes an evolutionarily highly conserved physiological inhibitor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (HH). HHIP is critical to several in utero developmental lung processes. It is also implicated in homeostasis, injury response, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor resistance to apoptosis. A few studies have reported decreased HHIP RNA and protein levels in human adult COPD lungs. HHIP+/- murine models led to emphysema. HH pathway inhibitors, such as vismodegib and sonidegib, are already validated in oncology, whereas other drugs have evidenced in vitro effects. Targeting the Hedgehog pathway could lead to a new therapeutic avenue in COPD. In this review, we focused on the early and severe COPD phenotype and the small lung hypothesis by exploring genetic susceptibility traits that are potentially treatable, thus summarizing promising therapeutics for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important step in tumor progression, which enables tumor cells to acquire migration and invasion characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of biological biochanin A (BCA) in ameliorating fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) lung injury. The results showed that PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; could induce spindle-like changes in cell morphology, causing the ability of migration and invasion. However, they were significantly inhibited by BCA treatment (10/20/30 μm). After BCA treatment, the release and transcription of chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor gene CXCR4 were inhibited, and the release of growth inducer TGF-β1 was significantly reduced. In addition, BCA promoted the transcription of E-cadherin and β-catenin, inhibiting the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin, and down-regulated the expression of MMP-2/9. We found that BCA effectively interfered with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activated by PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;. In conclusion, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; can induce EMT in lung cancer cells, and BCA may reverse this process by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polysaccharides from &lt;em&gt;Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum&lt;/em&gt; Diels et Gilg (SYQP) attenuated LPS-induced ALI in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYQP exerted anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYQP alleviated ALI by inhibiting TLR4/COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum&lt;/em&gt; Diels et Gilg (Sanyeqing, SYQ), a traditional herb native to China, has been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, febrile convulsions and dysentery. Previous studies have demonstrated the hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects of polysaccharides from SYQ (SYQP). However, the role of SYQP in acute lung injury (ALI) remained unknown. Our present study aimed to explore the protective effects of SYQP in ALI and explained its underlying mechanism. In vivo, Balb/c mice were intragastrically administered with SYQP and dexamethasone (DXMS) for 14 days which were intratracheally instilled (IT) with LPS at the last day. In vitro, A549 cells were pretreated with SYQP, DXMS or TAK-242, following by LPS stimulation for 24 h. The histopathological results showed that SYQP remarkably alleviated pulmonary macrophage infiltration and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels. Additionally, SYQP evidently suppressed wet/dry (W/D) ratio of lung and white blood cells (WBC) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Moreover, SYQP markedly reduced TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and COX-2 levels both in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, SYQP significantly attenuated oxidative stress through upregulating the levels of SOD and GSH-Px and downregulating the expressions of MDA and LDH in vivo, which was confirmed by in vitro results that SYQP could increase SOD activity and decrease MDA and NO contents. Importantly, a decline in protein expressions of TLR4, COX-2, NF-κB p50, phospho-NF-κB p65 and phospho-IκB-α was detected in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our results demonstrated that SYQP ameliorated LPS-induced ALI by alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress via attenuating TLR4/COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chlorogenic acid enhances alveolar macrophages phagocytosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome by activating G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR 37)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36194973/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impaired alveolar macrophages phagocytosis can contribute to pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and negatively impacts clinical outcomes. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound with potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant bioactivities. Studies have shown that CGA plays a protective role in ARDS, however, the precise protective mechanism of CGA against ARDS, is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate whether CGA enhances alveolar macrophages phagocytosis to attenuate lung injury during ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (100 μg/ml for 24 h) and treated with CGA (100, 200, and 400 μM CGA for 1 h) to measure pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, GPR37 expression and macrophages phagocytosis. Mouse models of ARDS induced by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) surgery were treated with CGA (100 or 200 mg/kg) to investigate lung inflammatory injury and alveolar macrophages phagocytosis. Computational modeling was performed to examine potential binding sites of G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) with CGA, and the results were validated by interfering with the binding sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Result&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, CGA notably ameliorated inflammatory response and increased phagocytosis in lipopolysaccharides-induced RAW264.7 cells. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, CGA administration significantly alleviated lung inflammatory injury, decreased the bacteria load in the lung, promoted alveolar macrophages phagocytosis and improved the survival rate in mice with CLP-induced ARDS. Moreover, CGA markedly upregulated the expression of GPR37 &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. However, the protective effect of CGA against ARDS were reversed after silencing the expression of GPR37.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CGA has a protective effect against ARDS and may enhance alveolar macrophages phagocytosis and attenuate lung inflammatory injury by upregulating GPR37 expression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibiting ALK-TOPK signaling pathway promotes cell apoptosis of ALK-positive NSCLC</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-LAK cell-oriented protein kinase (TOPK) is a potential therapeutic target in tumors. However, its role in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been reported. Here, we found that TOPK was highly expressed in ALK-positive NSCLC. Additionally, ALK was identified as another upstream kinase of TOPK by in vitro kinase assay screening. Then, it was proven that ALK phosphorylated TOPK at Y74 in vitro and ex vivo, and the pathways downstream of ALK-TOPK were explored by phosphoproteomic analysis. Subsequently, we demonstrated that inhibiting TOPK enhanced tumor sensitivity to alectinib (an ALK inhibitor). The combination of alectinib and HI-032 (a TOPK inhibitor) suppressed the growth and promoted the apoptosis of ALK-positive NSCLC cells ex vivo and in vivo. Our findings reveal a novel ALK-TOPK signaling pathway in ALK-positive NSCLC. The combination of alectinib and HI-032 might be a promising therapeutic strategy for improving the sensitivity of ALK-positive NSCLC to targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating Myeloid Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles as Mediators of Indirect Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150169/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood-borne myeloid cells, neutrophils and monocytes, play a central role in the development of indirect acute lung injury (ALI) during sepsis and non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). By contrast, the contribution of circulating myeloid cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) to ALI is unknown, despite acute increases in their numbers during sepsis and SIRS. Here, we investigated the direct role of circulating myeloid-EVs in ALI using a mouse isolated perfused lung system and a human cell coculture model of pulmonary vascular inflammation consisting of lung microvascular endothelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Total and immunoaffinity-isolated myeloid (CD11b+) and platelet (CD41+) EVs were prepared from the plasma of i.v. LPS-injected endotoxemic donor mice and transferred directly into recipient lungs. Two-hour perfusion of lungs with unfractionated EVs from a single donor induced pulmonary edema formation and increased perfusate levels of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), consistent with lung injury. These responses were abolished in the lungs of monocyte-depleted mice. The isolated myeloid- but not platelet-EVs produced a similar injury response and the acute intravascular release of proinflammatory cytokines and endothelial injury markers. In the in vitro human coculture model, human myeloid (CD11b+) but not platelet (CD61+) EVs isolated from LPS-stimulated whole blood induced acute proinflammatory cytokine production and endothelial activation. These findings implicate circulating myeloid-EVs as acute mediators of pulmonary vascular inflammation and edema, suggesting an alternative therapeutic target for attenuation of indirect ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal Microbiota-derived Propionic Acid Protects against Zinc Oxide Nanoparticle-induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150095/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of nanotechnology, the risks of accidental and/or occupational exposure to zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) are increasing. Inhalation of ZnONPs induces metal fume fever in humans and acute lung injury (ALI) in animal models. Although the intestinal microbiota is considered an important modulator of various diseases, the role and mechanism of intestinal microbiota in the pathology of ZnONP-induced ALI are unclear. Herein, we established an intratracheal instillation of a ZnONP-induced ALI mouse model and found that the inhalation of ZnONPs caused ALI along with a perturbation of intestinal flora. Antibiotic cocktail treatment-mediated depletion of intestinal microbiota aggravated ZnONP-induced ALI, and in contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation-mediated restoration of intestinal microbiota exerted the opposite effects. A decrease in short-chain fatty acids, the intestinal microbiota-derived metabolites in the plasma-in particular, acetic acid and propionic acid-occurred after exposure to ZnONPs. It is important to note that supplementation with propionic acid, but not acetic acid, ameliorated ZnONP-induced ALI. We also showed that the source of inflammatory cytokines might partially be the infiltration of macrophages. Supplementation with propionic acid was found to act on macrophages through the receptor GPR43, because knockdown of GPR43 sharply reversed the protective effects of propionic acid during the ZnONP-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress in both primary alveolar macrophages and RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines. Altogether, a novel gut-lung axis mechanism is revealed in which intestinal microbiota and their derived metabolite propionic acid play protective roles against ZnONP-induced ALI and suggest that fecal microbiota transplantation and supplementation with propionic acid are potential remedy strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chitinase 3 like 1 contributes to the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling in pulmonary hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35951428/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1) is the prototypic chitinase-like protein mediating inflammation, cell proliferation, and tissue remodeling. Limited data suggest CHI3L1 is elevated in human pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and is associated with disease severity. Despite its importance as a regulator of injury/repair responses, the relationship between CHI3L1 and pulmonary vascular remodeling is not well understood. We hypothesize that CHI3L1 and its signaling pathways contribute to the vascular remodeling responses that occur in pulmonary hypertension (PH). We examined the relationship of plasma CHI3L1 levels and severity of PH in patients with various forms of PH, including group 1 PAH and group 3 PH, and found that circulating levels of serum CHI3L1 were associated with worse hemodynamics and correlated directly with mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. We also used transgenic mice with constitutive knockout and inducible overexpression of CHI3L1 to examine its role in hypoxia-, monocrotaline-, and bleomycin-induced models of pulmonary vascular disease. In all 3 mouse models of pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary hypertensive responses were mitigated in CHI3L1-null mice and accentuated in transgenic mice that overexpress CHI3L1. Finally, CHI3L1 alone was sufficient to induce pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation, inhibit pulmonary vascular endothelial cell apoptosis, induce the loss of endothelial barrier function, and induce endothelial-mesenchymal transition. These findings demonstrate that CHI3L1 and its receptors play an integral role in pulmonary vascular disease pathobiology and may offer a target for the treatment of PAH and PH associated with fibrotic lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selenium-enriched soybean peptides pretreatment attenuates lung injury in mice induced by fine particulate matters (PM2.5) through inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB/IκBα signaling pathway and inflammasome generation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35979800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to identify and prepare peptides from selenium (Se)-enriched soybeans and determine whether dietary Se-enriched soybean peptides (Se-SPep) could inhibit lung injury in mice induced by fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups. The mice in the prevention groups were pretreated with 378 mg kg-1 of Se-SPep, soybean peptides (SPep), and Se-enriched soybean protein (Se-SPro), respectively, for four weeks. The mice in the PM2.5 exposure group received concentrated PM2.5 (15 μg per day mice) for 1 h daily from the third week for two weeks. The results showed that the leukocyte and cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the PM2.5 exposure group were higher than those in the control group. Se-SPep pretreatment decreased the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels compared with the PM2.5 exposure group. Additionally, Se-SPep pretreatment inhibited TLR4/NF-κB/IκBα and NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 protein expression in the lungs. In conclusion, Se-SPep pretreatment may protect the lungs of the mice against PM2.5-induced inflammation, suggesting that Se-SPep represents a potential preventative agent to inhibit PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses exploit host cell machinery to support their replication. Defining the cellular proteins and processes required for a virus during infection is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of virally induced disease and designing host-directed therapeutics. Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screening in lung epithelial cells infected with the PR/8/NS1-GFP virus and use GFPhi cell as a unique screening marker to identify host factors that inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We discovered that APOE affects influenza virus infection both in vitro and in vivo. Cell deficiency in APOE conferred substantially increased susceptibility to IAV; mice deficient in APOE manifested more severe lung pathology, increased virus load, and decreased survival rate. Mechanistically, lack of cell-produced APOE results in impaired cell cholesterol homeostasis, enhancing influenza virus attachment. Thus, we identified a previously unrecognized role of APOE in restraining IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Csf2ra deletion attenuates acute lung injuries induced by intratracheal inoculation of aerosolized ricin in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36203597/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific therapeutics are not available for acute lung injury (ALI) induced by ricin toxin (RT). Inhibiting the host immune response in the course of pulmonary ricinosis is hypothesized to be of benefit and can be achieved by impairing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling, thereby reducing the pro-inflammatory response to exogenous foreign body invasion. However, it is unknown whether mice with impaired GM-CSF signaling can survive after RT inhalation. To test this, colony stimulating factor 2 receptor alpha (&lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt;) knockout (KO) mice that lack GM-CSF signaling and wild-type (WT) mice models of intratracheal exposure to a lethal dose (2× LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of RT were established. Survival was greater in &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice 21 days after RT inhalation compared with WT mice. Highly co-expressed genes that probably attenuated the pro-inflammatory response in the lung of &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice were identified. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that transcriptome changes involved mostly inflammation-related genes after RT exposure in both &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice and WT mice. However, the activity levels of pro-inflammatory pathways, such as the TNF signaling pathway and NF-κB signaling pathway, in &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice were significantly decreased and the degree of neutrophil chemotaxis and recruitment inhibited after RT-exposure relative to WT mice. RT-qPCR and flow cytometry validated results of RNA-Seq analysis. This work provides potential avenues for host-directed therapeutic applications that can mitigate the severity of ALI-induced by RT.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition Is Protective in Hyperoxia-Induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36193076/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Studies have linked severe hyperoxia, or prolonged exposure to very high oxygen levels, with worse clinical outcomes. This study investigated the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in hyperoxia-induced lung injury at very high oxygen levels (&amp;gt;95%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Effects of severe hyperoxia (100% oxygen) were studied in mice with genetically inhibited EGFR and wild-type littermates. Despite the established role of EGFR in lung repair, EGFR inhibition led to improved survival and reduced acute lung injury, which prompted an investigation into this protective mechanism. Endothelial EGFR genetic knockout did not confer protection. EGFR inhibition led to decreased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) and decreased terminal dUTP nick end labeling- (TUNEL-) positive staining in alveolar epithelial cells and reduced ERK activation, which suggested reduced apoptosis in vivo. EGFR inhibition decreased hyperoxia (95%)-induced apoptosis and ERK in murine alveolar epithelial cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and CRISPR-mediated EGFR deletion reduced hyperoxia-induced apoptosis and ERK in human alveolar epithelial cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In conditions of severe hyperoxia (&amp;gt;95% for &amp;gt;24 h), EGFR inhibition led to improved survival, decreased lung injury, and reduced cell death. These findings further elucidate the complex role of EGFR in acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work defines a protective role of EGFR inhibition to decrease apoptosis in lung injury induced by 100% oxygen. This further characterizes the complex role of EGFR in acute lung injury and outlines a novel hyperoxia-induced cell death pathway that warrants further study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFN-γ transforms the transcriptomic landscape and triggers myeloid cell hyperresponsiveness to cause lethal lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36203588/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory disease that is associated with high mortality but no specific treatment. Our understanding of initial events that trigger ARDS pathogenesis is limited. We have developed a mouse model of inflammatory lung injury by influenza and methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) coinfection plus daily antibiotic therapy. Using this pneumonic ARDS model, here we show that IFN-γ receptor signaling drives inflammatory cytokine storm and lung tissue damage. By single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, we demonstrate that IFN-γ signaling induces a transcriptional shift in airway immune cells, particularly by upregulating macrophage and monocyte expression of genes associated with inflammatory diseases. Further evidence from conditional knockout mouse models reveals that IFN-γ receptor signaling in myeloid cells, particularly CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mononuclear phagocytes, directly promotes TNF-α hyperproduction and inflammatory lung damage. Collectively, the findings from this study, ranging from cell-intrinsic gene expression to overall disease outcome, demonstrate that influenza-induced IFN-γ triggers myeloid cell hyperresponsiveness to MRSA, thereby leading to excessive inflammatory response and lethal lung damage during coinfection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protease-activated receptor 2 promotes clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection by inducing cAMP-Rac1 signaling in alveolar macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36204227/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient phagocytosis of pathogens by the innate immune system during infectious injury is vital for restoring tissue integrity. Impaired phagocytosis, such as in the case of infection with &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, a broad-spectrum antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterium, can lead to a life threatening lung disorder, acute lung injury (ALI). Evidence indicates that loss of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) impaired &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; clearance leading to non-resolvable ALI, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we focused on the alveolar macrophages (AMs), the predominant population of lung-resident macrophages involved in sensing bacteria, to understand their role in PAR2-mediated phagocytosis of &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. We found that upon binding &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, PAR2-expressing but not PAR2-null AMs had increased cAMP levels, which activated Rac1 through protein kinase A. Activated Rac1 increased actin-rich protrusions to augment the phagocytosis of &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. Administration of liposomes containing constitutively active Rac1 into PAR2-null mice lungs rescued phagocytosis and enhanced the survival of PAR2-null mice from pneumonia. These studies showed that PAR2 drives the cAMP-Rac1 signaling cascade that activates &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; phagocytosis in AMs, thereby preventing death from bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Review of Non-Invasive Drug Delivery through Respiratory Routes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36145722/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With rapid and non-invasive characteristics, the respiratory route of administration has drawn significant attention compared with the limitations of conventional routes. Respiratory delivery can bypass the physiological barrier to achieve local and systemic disease treatment. A scientometric analysis and review were used to analyze how respiratory delivery can contribute to local and systemic therapy. The literature data obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection database showed an increasing worldwide tendency toward respiratory delivery from 1998 to 2020. Keywords analysis suggested that nasal and pulmonary drug delivery are the leading research topics in respiratory delivery. Based on the results of scientometric analysis, the research hotspots mainly included therapy for central nervous systems (CNS) disorders (Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease, depression, glioblastoma, and epilepsy), tracheal and bronchial or lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, acute lung injury or respiratory distress syndrome, lung cancer, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), and systemic diseases (diabetes and COVID-19). The study of advanced preparations contained nano drug delivery systems of the respiratory route, drug delivery barriers investigation (blood-brain barrier, BBB), and chitosan-based biomaterials for respiratory delivery. These results provided researchers with future research directions related to respiratory delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFN- γ Is Protective in Cytokine Release Syndrome-associated Extrapulmonary Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36125351/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms by which excessive systemic activation of adaptive T lymphocytes, as in cytokine release syndrome (CRS), leads to innate immune cell-mediated acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome, often in the absence of any infection, remains unknown. Here, we investigated the roles of IFN-γ and IL-17A, key T-cell cytokines significantly elevated in patients with CRS, in the immunopathogenesis of CRS-induced extrapulmonary ALI. CRS was induced in wild-type (WT), IL-17A- and IFN-γ knockout (KO) human leukocyte antigen-DR3 transgenic mice with 10 μg of the superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, given intraperitoneally. Several ALI parameters, including gene expression profiling in the lungs, were studied 4, 24, or 48 hours later. Systemic T-cell activation with staphylococcal enterotoxin B resulted in robust upregulation of several chemokines, S100A8/A9, matrix metalloproteases, and other molecules implicated in tissue damage, granulocyte as well as agranulocyte adhesion, and diapedesis in the lungs as early as 4 hours, which was accompanied by subsequent neutrophil/eosinophil lung infiltration and severe ALI in IFN-γ KO mice. These pathways were significantly underexpressed in IL-17A KO mice, which manifested mildest ALI and intermediate in WT mice. Neutralization of IFN-γ worsened ALI in WT and IL-17A KO mice, whereas neutralizing IL-17A did not mitigate lung injury in IFN-γ KO mice, suggesting a dominant protective role for IFN-γ in ALI and that IL-17A is dispensable. Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, increased ALI severity in WT mice. Thus, our study identified novel mechanisms of ALI in CRS and its differential modulation by IFN-γ and IL-17A.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of tocilizumab and dexamethasone on the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of antioxidants in the lungs in oleic acid-induced ARDS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36115998/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening disease caused by the induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs. There is a dearth of drug applications that can be used to prevent cytokine storms in ARDS treatment. This study was designed to investigate the effects of tocilizumab and dexamethasone on oxidative stress, antioxidant parameters, and cytokine storms in acute lung injury caused by oleic acid in rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Adult male rats were divided into five groups: the CN (healthy rats, n = 6), OA (oleic acid administration, n = 6), OA + TCZ-2 (oleic acid and tocilizumab at 2 mg/kg, n = 6), OA + TCZ-4 (oleic acid and tocilizumab at 4 mg/kg, n = 6), and OA + DEX-10 (oleic acid and dexamethasone at 10 mg/kg, n = 6) groups. All animals were euthanized after treatment for histopathological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, PCR, and SEM analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 cytokines in rats with acute lung injury induced by oleic acid were downregulated in the TCZ and DEX groups compared to the OA group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The MDA level in lung tissues was statistically lower in the OA + TCZ-4 group compared to the OA group. It was further determined that SOD, GSH, and CAT levels were decreased in the OA group and increased in the TCZ and DEX groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Histopathological findings such as thickening of the alveoli, hyperemia, and peribronchial cell infiltration were found to be similar when lung tissues of the TCZ and DEX groups were compared to the control group. With SEM imaging of the lung tissues, it was found that the alveolar lining layer had become indistinct in the OA, OA + TCZ-2, and OA + TCZ-4 groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In this model of acute lung injury caused by oleic acid, tocilizumab and dexamethasone were effective in preventing cytokine storms by downregulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. Against the downregulation of antioxidant parameters such as SOD and GSH in the lung tissues caused by oleic acid, tocilizumab and dexamethasone upregulated them and showed protective effects against cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liang-Ge decoction ameliorates acute lung injury in septic model rats through reducing inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and modulating host metabolism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36188538/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liang-Ge decoction (LG) has been used in the treatment of early stage of spesis and can ameliorate sepsis-associated lung injury. However, the mechanism of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury remains unknown. In this study, we established a rat model of sepsis-associated lung injury using the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method, and investigated the therapeutic effects of LG on lung injury in rats with sepsis. In addition, the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury model rats were evaluated. Besides, untargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the regulation of metabolites in rats with sepsis-associated lung injury after LG treatment. Our results showed that LG could decrease the wet/dry (W/D) ratio in lung and the total cell count and total protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in septic model rats. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining showed that LG reduced the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells in lung. In addition, LG treatmment down-regulated the gene and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokins in lung tissue and BALF. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were increased and the level of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) was decreased in lung tissue homogenate in septic model rats after LG treament. Moreover, the numbers of apoptotic cells in lung were reduced and the activity of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) in BALF was decreased in septic model rats after LG treament. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that LG treatment affected the levels of 23 metabolites in lung in septic model rats such as citric acid, methionine, threonine, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, and inositol, these metabolites were associated with the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism and citrate cycle (TCA cycle) pathways. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the therapeutic effetcts of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury model rats. Moreover, LG could inhibit the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis and regulate metabolites related to glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism and TCA cycle in lung in sepsis-associated lung injury model rats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;NKA α1 interacts with TLR4 and SFKs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1 restricts LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice injected with LPS show more lung injury and lower survival rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na/K-ATPase (NKA), besides its ion transporter function, is a signal transducer by regulating Src family kinases (SFK). The signaling NKA contributes to oxidized LDL-induced macrophage foam cell formation and interacts with TLR4. However, its role in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced signaling and glycolytic switch in macrophages remains unclear. Using peritoneal macrophages from NKA α1 haploinsufficient mice (NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;), we found that NKA α1 haploinsufficiency led to enhanced LPS-stimulated NF-κB pathway, ROS signaling, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS resulted in more severe lung inflammation and injury with lower survival rate in NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Additionally, LPS induced a higher extent of the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Mechanistically, NKA α1 interacted with TLR4 and Lyn. The presence of NKA α1 in this complex attenuated Lyn activation by LPS, which subsequently restricted the downstream ROS and NF-κB signaling. In conclusion, we demonstrated that NKA α1 suppresses LPS-induced macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling through Lyn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rectal administration of butyrate ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis in mice through induction of hepatocyte growth factor in the colon via the HDAC-PPARγ pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36116532/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butyrate, given by oral administration or in drinking water, has been shown to improve experimental pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in mice despite of very low bioavailability. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics disconnection attracts us to explore its anti-PF mechanism in view of the intestinal expression of anti-PF factors. In bleomycin-induced PF in mice, rectal administration of butyrate (500 mg/kg) exhibited a significant anti-PF effect, with a maximum plasma concentration largely lower than the minimum effective concentration (1 mM) at which butyrate inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory factors by lung epithelial cells and the production of extracellular matrix by lung fibroblasts. The rectal administration of butyrate significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the colons of PF mice, but showed no significant effect on the mRNA expression of HGF in the small intestines, lungs and livers. In colon epithelial cells, the monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHC) abrogated butyrate-induced expression of HGF, indicating that butyrate functions through entering into cells. Butyrate showed no significant effect on the histone acetylation in the promoter region of HGF, suggesting that it promotes HGF expression not by directly affecting the histone deacetylation of HGF but by other pathways. GW9662, the inhibitor of PPARγ, significantly attenuated the effect of butyrate to promote the mRNA expression of HGF. Butyrate was able to enhance the acetylation of PPARγ, and a targeted mutation of lysine at the position 240 (K240) of PPARγ markedly diminished the induction of butyrate on HGF expression, suggesting that butyrate promoted HGF expression in colon epithelial cells by upregulating PPARγ K240 acetylation. In summary, rectal administration of butyrate promotes the expression of HGF in colonic epithelial cells through upregulating PPARγ acetylation via inhibition of HDAC activity. The findings of the present study provide a reasonable explanation for the anti-PF action mode of butyrate based on the &amp;rsquo;lung-gut axis&amp;rsquo;, and found that intestine-derived butyrate and HGF may be involved in the modulation of the occurrence and progression of PF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A potential new pathway for heparin treatment of sepsis-induced lung injury: inhibition of pulmonary endothelial cell pyroptosis by blocking hMGB1-LPS-induced caspase-11 activation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a significant cause of mortality in critically ill patients. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a leading cause of death in these patients. Endothelial cells exposed to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can progress into pyroptosis, a programmed lysis of cell death triggered by inflammatory caspases. It is characterized by lytic cell death induced by the binding of intracellular LPS to caspases 4/5 in human cells and caspase-11 in mouse cells. In mice,caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis plays an important role in endotoxemia. HMGB1 released into the plasma binds to LPS and is internalized into lysosomes in endothelial cells via the advanced glycation end product receptor. In the acidic lysosomal environment, HMGB1 permeates the phospholipid bilayer, which is followed by the leakage of LPS into the cytoplasm and the activation of caspase-11. Heparin is an anticoagulant widely applied in the treatment of thrombotic disease. Previous studies have found that heparin could block caspase-11-dependent inflammatory reactions, decrease sepsis-related mortality, and reduce ALI, independent of its anticoagulant activity. Heparin or modified heparin with no anticoagulant property could inhibit the alarmin HMGB1-LPS interactions, minimize LPS entry into the cytoplasm, and thus blocking caspase-11 activation. Heparin has been studied in septic ALI, but the regulatory mechanism of pulmonary endothelial cell pyroptosis is still unclear. In this paper, we discuss the potential novel role of heparin in the treatment of septic ALI from the unique mechanism of pulmonary endothelial cell pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astragaloside IV regulates the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to inhibit PM2.5-mediated lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36115280/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5-induced lung injury was associated with the ferroptosis and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV pre-treatment attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury by inhibiting ferroptosis via Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV is a potential drug for prevention of PM2.5-induced respiratory disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Exposure to PM2.5 will increase the risk of respiratory disease and increase the burden of social health care. Astragaloside Ⅳ (Ast-IV) is one of the main biologically active substances form Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus, which owns various pharmacological effects. Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by accumulation of iron-dependent lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is not clear whether there are typical features of ferroptosis in PM2.5-induced lung injury. This study investigates whether PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice has a special form of ferroptosis and the specific protective mechanism of Ast-IV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjects and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Forty-two male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 7 per group): NS group (normal saline), Ast group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg), PM2.5 group, Ast-L group (Ast-IV 50 mg/kg + PM2.5), Ast-H group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + PM2.5) and Era group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + erastin 20 mg/kg + PM2.5). Mice were pre-treated with Ast-IV intraperitoneally for three days. Then, PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) was given by non-invasive tracheal instillation to induce lung injury. The ferroptosis&amp;rsquo; agonist erastin was used to verify the mechanism of Ast-IV anti-ferroptosis. 12 h after PM2.5 stimulation, the mice were euthanized. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum were collected for oxidative stress and cytokine determination. Lung tissues were collected for glutathione (GSH), tissue iron content, histology, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Ast-IV reduced the lung wet-dry ratio and the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in serum. Ast-IV could also improve the oxidative stress level in BALF, restore the GSH level in the lung tissue, and reduce the iron content in the lung tissue. Western blot outcomes revealed that Ast-IV regulated the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to protect PM2.5-mediated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The protective effect of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice might be related to the inhibition of ferroptosis in lung tissue. Anti-ferroptosis might be a new mechanism of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>D-tagatose protects against oleic acid-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in rats by activating PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36189316/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier, resulting in severe alveolar edema and inflammation. D-tagatose (TAG) is a low-calorie fructose isomer with diverse biological activities whose role in ARDS has never been explored. We found that TAG protects lung tissues from injury in the oleic acid-induced rat model of ARDS. Seventeen male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups: Sham (n = 5), ARDS (n = 6), and TAG + ARDS (n = 6). The treatment groups were injected with oleic acid to induce ARDS, and the TAG + ARDS group was given TAG 3 days before the induction. After the treatments, the effect of TAG was evaluated by blood gas analysis and observing the gross and histological structure of the lung. The results showed that TAG significantly improved the oxygenation function, reduced the respiratory acidosis and the inflammatory response. TAG also improved the vascular permeability in ARDS rats and promoted the differentiation of alveolar type II cells, maintaining the stability of the alveolar structure. This protective effect of TAG on the lung may be achieved by activating the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, TAG protects against oleic acid-induced ARDS in rats, suggesting a new clinical strategy for treating the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin ameliorates LPS-induced acute lung injury by maintenance of pulmonary microvascular barrier via activating the Epac1/AKT pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin alleviates LPS-induced pulmonary injury and edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin protects against PMVECs hyperpermeability via preventing the loss of adherens junctions and tight junctions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress by regulating mitochondrial function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin attenuates PMVECs barrier dysfunction via activating the Epac1/AKT signaling axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) barrier dysfunction is a main pathophysiological feature of sepsis-related acute lung injury (ALI). This study aimed to investigate whether the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor linagliptin could protect against LPS-induced PMVECs barrier disruption and its underlying molecular mechanisms. A classical ALI animal model and LPS-treated PMVECs were applied and all were treated with or without linagliptin. Cellular experiments demonstrated that linagliptin could mitigate LPS-induced PMVECs hyperpermeability and intercellular junction (VE-cadherin, β-catenin, and ZO-1) disruption in a dose-dependent manner. Correspondingly, it was observed that linagliptin pretreatment distinctly relieved LPS-induced lung injury, oxidative stress, and pulmonary edema in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of oxidative stress by linagliptin may be achieved by reversing impaired mitochondrial function. Mechanistically, linagliptin administration promoted the activation of the Epac1 pathway and its downstream AKT pathway, while inhibition of the Epac1/Akt signaling pathway significantly alleviated the above-mentioned protective effect of linagliptin on the PMVECs barrier. Taken together, these data suggest that linagliptin can effectively reserve PMVECs barrier dysfunction and inhibit oxidative stress to protect against ALI via activating the Epac1/AKT signaling pathway, and thus may become a potential clinical therapeutic strategy for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chromatin remodeler Znhit1 controls bone morphogenetic protein signaling in embryonic lung tissue branching</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36115458/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branching morphogenesis is a key process essential for lung and other organ development in which cellular and tissue architecture branch out to maximize surface area. While this process is known to be regulated by differential gene expression of ligands and receptors, how chromatin remodeling regulates this process remains unclear. Znhit1 (zinc finger HIT-type containing 1), acting as a chromatin remodeler, has previously been shown to control the deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z. Here, we demonstrate that Znhit1 also plays an important role in regulating lung branching. Using Znhit1 conditional KO mice, we show that Znhit1 deficiency in the embryonic lung epithelium leads to failure of branching morphogenesis and neonatal lethality, which is accompanied by reduced cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis of the epithelium. The results from the transcriptome and the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay reveal that this is partially regulated by the derepression of Bmp4, encoding bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4, which is a direct target of H2A.Z. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of BMP signaling by the protein inhibitor Noggin rescues the lung branching defects of Znhit1 mutants ex vivo. Taken together, our study identifies the critical role of Znhit1/H2A.Z in embryonic lung morphogenesis via the regulation of BMP signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Probiotics ameliorates pulmonary inflammation via modulating gut microbiota and rectifying Th17/Treg imbalance in a rat model of PM2.5 induced lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 exposure altered gut microbiome and influences the balance of Th17/Treg cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The changes of gut microbiome and the imbalance of Th17/Treg cell are critical mechanism of PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The administration of Probiotics regulating Th17/Treg cell balance and gut microbiome attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imbalance of intestinal microbiota and inflammatory response is crucial in the development of lung injury induced by PM2.5. In recent years, probiotics have attracted great attention for their health benefits in inflammatory diseases and regulating intestinal balance, but their intricate mechanisms need further experiments to elucidate. In our research, a rat lung damage model induced by PM2.5 exposure in real environment was established to explore the protective properties of probiotics on PM2.5 exposure injury and its related mechanism. The results indicated that compared with the AF control group, rats in the PM2.5 group gained weight slowly, ate less and had yellow hair. The results of pathological and immunohistochemical examinations showed that the inflammatory infiltration of lung tissue was alleviated after probiotic treatment. The Lung function results also showed the improvement effects of probiotics administration. In addition, probiotics could promote the balance of Th17 and Treg cells, inhibit cytokines expression (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17A), and increase the concentration of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10, TGF-β). In addition, 16 S rRNA sequence analysis showed that probiotic treatment could reduce microbiota abundance and diversity, increase the abundance of possible beneficial bacteria, and decrease the abundance of bacteria associated with inflammation. In general, probiotic intervention was found to have preventive effects on the occurrence of PM2.5 induced pathological injury, and the mechanism was associate with to the inhibition of inflammatory response, regulation of Th17/Treg balance and maintenance of intestinal internal environment stability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by aberrant activation of the alveolar epithelium, the expansion of the fibroblast population, and the accumulation of extracellular matrix. Global gene expression of human lung fibroblasts stimulated with TGFβ-1, a strong fibrotic mediator revealed the overexpression of ZNF365, a zinc finger protein implicated in cell cycle control and telomere stabilization. We evaluated the expression and localization of ZNF365 in IPF lungs and in the fibrotic response induced by bleomycin in WT and deficient mice of the orthologous gene &lt;em&gt;Zfp365&lt;/em&gt;. In IPF, ZNF365 was overexpressed and localized in fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and alveolar epithelium. Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis showed an upregulation of Zfp365 localized in lung epithelium and stromal cell populations. &lt;em&gt;Zfp365&lt;/em&gt; KO mice developed a significantly higher fibrotic response compared with WT mice by morphology and hydroxyproline content. Silencing &lt;em&gt;ZNF365&lt;/em&gt; in human lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells induced a significant reduction of growth rate and increased senescence markers, including Senescence Associated β Galactosidase activity, p53, p21, and the histone variant γH2AX. Our findings demonstrate that ZNF365 is upregulated in IPF and experimental lung fibrosis and suggest a protective role since its absence increases experimental lung fibrosis mechanistically associated with the induction of cell senescence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of radiation biodosimetry has changed recently, and a paradigm shift for using molecular technologies of omic platforms in addition to cytogenetic techniques has been observed. In our study, we have used a nonhuman primate model to investigate the impact of a supralethal dose of 12 Gy radiation on alterations in the lung transcriptome. We used 6 healthy and 32 irradiated animal samples to delineate radiation-induced changes. We also used a medical countermeasure, γ-tocotrienol (GT3), to observe any changes. We demonstrate significant radiation-induced changes in the lung transcriptome for total-body irradiation (TBI) and partial-body irradiation (PBI). However, no major influence of GT3 on radiation was noted in either comparison. Several common signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, GADD45, and p53, were upregulated in both exposures. TBI activated DNA-damage-related pathways in the lungs, whereas PTEN signaling was activated after PBI. Our study highlights the various transcriptional profiles associated with γ- and X-ray exposures, and the associated pathways include LXR/RXR activation in TBI, whereas pulmonary wound-healing and pulmonary fibrosis signaling was repressed in PBI. Our study provides important insights into the molecular pathways associated with irradiation that can be further investigated for biomarker discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formyl peptide receptor (FPR) 2 is known to play a critical role in regulating inflammation, including either the pro-inflammatory or pro-resolving effects. However, its role in neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury has not been delineated. In this study, we investigate whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attenuate hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury by regulating FPR2 activity. We observed a significant increase in FPR2 levels in alveolar macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) after H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced stress, which decreased after MSC treatment. In the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induction model, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α and TNF-α) were significantly reduced in RAW264.7 cells after treatment with WRW4, an inhibitor of FPR2, or MSCs. Viability of lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells was significantly improved when cultured in the conditioned media of RAW264.7 cells treated with WRW4 or MSCs, compared to when cultured in the conditioned media of control RAW265.7 cells exposed to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For the in vivo study, wild-type and FPR2 knockout (FPR2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) C57/BL6 mouse pups were randomly exposed to 80% oxygen or room air from postnatal day (P) 1 to P14. At P5, 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; MSCs were transplanted intratracheally. MSCs reduced the elevated FPR2 activity at P7 and improved the decreased FPR2 activity as well as the increased immuno-stained FPR2 activity in alveolar macrophages in hyperoxic lungs at P14. Both FPR&lt;sup&gt;2-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and MSCs similarly attenuated impaired alveolarization and angiogenesis, and increased apoptosis and inflammation of hyperoxic lungs without synergistic effects. Our findings suggest that the protective effects of MSCs in hyperoxic lung injury might be related to indirect modulation of FPR2 activity, at least of alveolar macrophages in neonatal mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Systemic interleukin-6 inhibition ameliorates acute neuropsychiatric phenotypes in a murine model of acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute neuropsychiatric impairments occur in over 70% of patients with acute lung injury. Mechanical ventilation is a well-known precipitant of acute lung injury and is strongly associated with the development of acute delirium and anxiety phenotypes. In prior studies, we demonstrated that IL-6 mediates neuropathological changes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of animals with mechanical ventilation-induced brain injury; however, the effect of systemic IL-6 inhibition on structural and functional acute neuropsychiatric phenotypes is not known. We hypothesized that a murine model of mechanical ventilation-induced acute lung injury (VILI) would induce neural injury to the amygdala and hippocampus, brain regions that are implicated in diverse neuropsychiatric conditions, and corresponding delirium- and anxiety-like functional impairments. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these structural and functional changes would reverse with systemic IL-6 inhibition. VILI was induced using high tidal volume (35 cc/kg) mechanical ventilation. Cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) expression was quantified as a neural injury marker and found to be significantly increased in the VILI group compared to spontaneously breathing or anesthetized and mechanically ventilated mice with 10 cc/kg tidal volume. VILI mice treated with systemic IL-6 inhibition had significantly reduced amygdalar and hippocampal CC3 expression compared to saline-treated animals and demonstrated amelioration in acute neuropsychiatric behaviors in open field, elevated plus maze, and Y-maze tests. Overall, these data provide evidence of a pathogenic role of systemic IL-6 in mediating structural and functional acute neuropsychiatric symptoms in VILI and provide preclinical justification to assess IL-6 inhibition as a potential intervention to ameliorate acute neuropsychiatric phenotypes following VILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Interplay between Aquaporin-1 and the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α in a Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Lung Injury Model in Human Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36142499/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquaporin-1 (AQP1), a water channel, and the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A) are implicated in acute lung injury responses, modulating among others pulmonary vascular leakage. We hypothesized that the AQP1 and HIF1A systems interact, affecting mRNA, protein levels and function of AQP1 in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, the role of AQP1 in apoptosis and wound healing progression was examined. Both AQP1 mRNA and protein expression levels were higher in HPMECs exposed to LPS compared to untreated HPMECs. However, in the LPS-exposed &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt;-silenced cells, the mRNA and protein expression levels of AQP1 remained unaltered. In the permeability experiments, a statistically significant volume increase was observed at the 360 s time-point in the LPS-exposed HPMECs, while LPS-exposed &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt;-silenced HPMECs did not exhibit cell swelling, implying a dysfunctional AQP1. AQP1 did not seem to affect cell apoptosis yet could interfere with endothelial migration and/or proliferation. Based on our results, it seems that &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt; silencing negatively affects AQP1 mRNA and protein expression, as well as AQP1 function, in the setting of lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wnt5a/β-catenin axis is involved in the downregulation of AT2 lineage by PAI-1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to regenerate injured alveoli functionally and promptly causes a high incidence of fatality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). How elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) regulates the lineage of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells for re-alveolarization has not been studied. This study aimed to examine the role of PAI-1-Wnt5a-β catenin cascades in AT2 fate. Dramatic reduction in AT2 yield was observed in &lt;em&gt;Serpine1&lt;sup&gt;Tg&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Elevated PAI-1 level suppressed organoid number, development efficiency, and total surface area in vitro. Anti-PAI-1 neutralizing antibody restored organoid number, proliferation and differentiation of AT2 cells, and β-catenin level in organoids. Both Wnt family member 5A (Wnt5a) and Wnt5a-derived N-butyloxycarbonyl hexapeptide (Box5) altered the lineage of AT2 cells. This study demonstrates that elevated PAI-1 regulates AT2 proliferation and differentiation via the Wnt5a/β catenin cascades. PAI-1 could serve as autocrine signaling for lung injury repair.

      <title>Pretreatment with rosavin attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats through antiferroptosis via PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36097321/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation and oxidative stress caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increase the incidence and mortality rates of respiratory disorders. Rosavin is the main chemical component of Rhodiola plants, which exerts anti-oxidative and antiinflammatory effects. In this research, the potential therapeutic effect of rosavin was investigated by the PM2.5-induced lung injury rat model. Rats were instilled with PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) suspension intratracheally, while rosavin (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) was delivered by intraperitoneal injection before the PM2.5 injection. It was observed that rosavin could prevent lung injury caused by PM2.5. PM2.5 showed obvious ferroptosis-related ultrastructural alterations, which were significantly corrected by rosavin. The pretreatment with rosavin downregulated the levels of tissue iron, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal, and increased the levels of glutathione. The expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was upregulated by rosavin, together with other ferroptosis-related proteins. RSL3, a specific ferroptosis agonist, reversed the beneficial impact of rosavin. The network pharmacology approach predicted the activation of rosavin on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. LY294002, a potent PI3K inhibitor, decreased the upregulation of Nrf2 induced by rosavin. In conclusion, rosavin prevented lung injury induced by PM2.5 stimulation and suppressed ferroptosis via upregulating PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tanshinone IIA loaded bioactive nanoemulsion for alleviation of lipopolysaccharide induced acute lung injury via inhibition of endothelial glycocalyx shedding</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36099790/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSIIA showed evident protective effects in acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nanoemulsion with bioactive excipients enhanced TSIIA activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSIIA alleviates endothelial glycocalyx shedding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endothelial glycocalyx is an important therapeutic target for acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSIIA effect may be attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more serious form; acute respiratory distress syndrome are major causes of COVID-19 related mortality. Finding new therapeutic targets for ALI is thus of great interest. This work aimed to prepare a biocompatible nanoformulation for effective pulmonary delivery of the herbal drug; tanshinone-IIA (TSIIA) for ALI management. A nanoemulsion (NE) formulation based on bioactive natural ingredients; rhamnolipid biosurfactant and tea-tree oil, was developed using a simple ultrasonication technique, optimized by varying oil concentration and surfactant:oil ratio. The selected TSIIA-NE formulation showed 105.7 nm diameter and a PDI ∼ 0.3. EE exceeded 98 % with biphasic sustained drug release and good stability over 3-months. In-vivo efficacy was evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model. TSIIA-NE (30 µg/kg) was administered once intratracheally 2 h after LPS instillation. Evaluation was performed 7days post-treatment. Pulmonary function assessment, inflammatory, oxidative stress and glycocalyx shedding markers analysis in addition to histopathological examination of lung tissue were performed. When compared to untreated rats, in-vivo efficacy study demonstrated 1.4 and 1.9-fold increases in tidal volume and minute respiratory volume, respectively, with 32 % drop in wet/dry lung weight ratio and improved levels of arterial blood gases. Lung histopathology and biochemical analysis of different biomarkers in tissue homogenate and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid indicated that treatment may ameliorate LPS-induced ALI symptoms thorough anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory effects and inhibition of glycocalyx degradation. TSIIA-NE efficacy was superior to free medication and blank-NE. The enhanced efficacy of TSIIA bioactive nanoemulsion significantly suggests the pharmacotherapeutic potential of bioactive TSIIA-NE as a promising nanoplatform for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An anticomplement homogeneous polysaccharide from Hedyotis diffusa attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury and inhibits neutrophil extracellular trap formation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36116199/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Owing to the involvement of the overactivated complement system in acute lung injury (ALI) development, anticomplement components may attenuate ALI. Hedyotis diffusa is a traditional Chinese medicine for treating lung heat and its crude polysaccharides (HDP) exhibit significant anticomplement activity in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; To obtain an anticomplement homogeneous polysaccharide from HDP and verify its therapeutic effect and mechanism on ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Diethylaminoethyl-52 (DEAE-52) cellulose and gel permeation columns were used to isolate a homogeneous polysaccharide HD-PS-3, which was then characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and methylation analysis. In vitro, the anticomplement activities of HD-PS-3 through classical and alternative pathways were determined using a hemolytic test. The therapeutic effects of HDP and HD-PS-3 on ALI were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intratracheal instilled mice. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunohistochemical staining were used to assess histological changes, measure cytokine levels, and evaluate the degree of complement component 3c (C3c) deposition and neutrophil infiltration, respectively. ELISA, western blotting, and immunofluorescence were used to analyze neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; From HDP, 1.5 g of the homogeneous polysaccharide HD-PS-3 was obtained. HD-PS-3 was an acidic heteropolysaccharide with an acetyl group, which was composed of →4,6)-α-Glcp-(1→, →3,4)-α-Glcp-(1→, →4)-α-Glcp-(1→, →4,6)-α-Galp-(1→, →5)-α-Araf-(1→, α-Rhap-(1→, α-Araf-(1→, α-GlcpA-(1→, →4)-β-Manp-(1→, β-Manp-(1→ and →3)-β-Manp-(1→. The in vitro results suggest that HD-PS-3 exhibited anticomplement activity with CH50 and AP50 values of 115 ± 12 μg/ml and 307 ± 11 μg/ml, respectively. After confirming the efficacy of HDP (200 mg/kg) in attenuating lung injury, the effect of HD-PS-3 on ALI was also investigated. HD-PS-3 (75 and 150 mg/kg) attenuated LPS-induced ALI as well, evidenced by lung pathology, lung injury scores, protein concentration, leukocyte counts, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) contents in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Mechanistically, HD-PS-3 inhibited complement activation, manifested in reduced pulmonary C3c deposition in lung tissue and complement component 3a (C3a) content in BALF. Neutrophil recruitment was also reduced by HD-PS-3, with significantly reduced pulmonary neutrophil infiltration and lower levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in BALF. In addition, HD-PS-3 reduced the levels of MPO-DNA complex in BALF, decreased citrullinated histone H3 (Cit H3) expression and NET formation (colocalization of MPO, Cit H3, and DNA) in lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; An anticomplement homogeneous polysaccharide HD-PS-3 was isolated from H. diffusa. HD-PS-3 exhibited a therapeutic effect against ALI, and the mechanism might be related to its inhibitory effects on complement activation, neutrophil recruitment, and NET formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USP13 Deficiency Impairs Autophagy and Facilitates Age-related Lung Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150040/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an age-related disease. Failure of the proteostasis network with age, including insufficient autophagy, contributes to the pathology of IPF. Mechanisms underlying autophagy disruption in IPF are unclear and may involve regulation of USP (ubiquitin-specific protease) by post-translational modifications. To expand our previous observation of low USP13 expression in IPF, this study evaluated the role of USP13 in age-related lung fibrosis. Here, we demonstrated that &lt;em&gt;Usp13&lt;/em&gt;-deficient aged mice exhibited impaired autophagic activity and increased vulnerability to bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Mechanistically, USP13 interacted with and deubiquitinated Beclin 1, and Beclin 1 overexpression abolished the effects of USP13 disruption. In addition, Beclin 1 inhibition resulted in insufficient autophagy and more severe lung fibrosis after bleomycin injury, consistent with the phenotype of aged &lt;em&gt;Usp13&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice. Collectively, we show a protective role of USP13 in age-related pulmonary fibrosis. Aging-mediated USP13 loss impairs autophagic activity and facilitates lung fibrosis through Beclin 1 deubiquitination. Our findings support the notion that age-dependent dysregulation of autophagic regulators enhances vulnerability to lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FOXO3 mutation predicting gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity in NSCLC patients through regulation of autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36176901/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatotoxicity is a common side effect for patients treated with gefitinib, but the related pathogenesis is unclear and lacks effective predictor and management strategies. A multi-omics approach integrating pharmacometabolomics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics was employed in non-small cell lung cancer patients to identify the effective predictor for gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity and explore optional therapy substitution. Here, we found that patients with rs4946935 AA, located in Forkhead Box O3 (&lt;em&gt;FOXO3&lt;/em&gt;) which is a well-known autophagic regulator, had a higher risk of hepatotoxicity than those with the GA or GG variant (OR = 18.020, 95%CI = 2.473 to 459.1784, P = 0.018) in a gefitinib-concentration dependent pattern. Furthermore, functional experiments identified that rs4946935_A impaired the expression of &lt;em&gt;FOXO3&lt;/em&gt; by inhibiting the promotor activity, increasing the threshold of autophagy initiation and inhibiting the autophagic activity which contributed to gefitinib-induced liver injury. In contrast, erlotinib-induced liver injury was independent on the variant and expression levels of &lt;em&gt;FOXO3&lt;/em&gt;. This study reveals that &lt;em&gt;FOXO3&lt;/em&gt; mutation, leading to autophagic imbalance, plays important role in gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity, especially for patients with high concentration of gefitinib. In conclusion, &lt;em&gt;FOXO3&lt;/em&gt; mutation is an effective predictor and erlotinib might be an appropriately and well-tolerated treatment option for patients carrying rs4946935 AA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>H1N1 influenza virus dose dependent induction of dysregulated innate immune responses and STAT1/3 activation are associated with pulmonary immunopathological damage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infection poses a substantial challenge and causes high morbidity and mortality. Exacerbated pulmonary inflammatory responses are the major causes of extensive diffuse alveolar immunopathological damage. However, the relationship between the extent of cytokine storm, neutrophils/macrophages infiltration, and different IAV infection dose and time still needs to be further elucidated, and it is still unclear whether the signal transduction and transcriptional activator 1/3 (STAT1/3) signalling pathway plays a beneficial or detrimental role. Here, we established a mouse model of high- and low-dose pH1N1 infection. We found that pH1N1 infection induced robust and early pathological damage and cytokine storm in an infection dose- and time-dependent manner. High-dose pH1N1 infection induced massive and sustained recruitment of neutrophils as well as a higher ratio of M1:M2, which may contribute to severe lung immunopathological damage. pH1N1 infection activated dose- and time-dependent STAT1 and STAT3. Inhibition of STAT1 and/or STAT3 aggravated low-dose pH1N1 infection, induced lung damage, and decreased survival rate. Appropriate activation of STAT1/3 provided survival benefits and pathological improvement during low-dose pH1N1 infection. These results demonstrate that high-dose pH1N1 infection induces robust and sustained neutrophil infiltration, imbalanced macrophage polarization, excessive and earlier cytokine storm, and STAT1/3 activation, which are associated with pulmonary dysregulated proinflammatory responses and progress of acute lung injury. The severe innate immune responses may be the threshold at which protective functions give way to immunopathology, and assessing the magnitude of host innate immune responses is necessary in adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy for alleviating influenza-induced pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Injury-induced pulmonary tuft cells are heterogenous, arise independent of key Type 2 cytokines, and are dispensable for dysplastic repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36073526/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the lung bears significant regenerative capacity, severe viral pneumonia can chronically impair lung function by triggering dysplastic remodeling. The connection between these enduring changes and chronic disease remains poorly understood. We recently described the emergence of tuft cells within Krt5+ dysplastic regions after influenza injury. Using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, we characterized and delineated multiple distinct tuft cell populations that arise following influenza clearance. Distinct from intestinal tuft cells which rely on Type 2 immune signals for their expansion, neither IL-25 nor IL-4ra signaling are required to drive tuft cell development in dysplastic/injured lungs. In addition, tuft cell expansion occurred independently of type I or type III interferon signaling. Furthermore, tuft cells were also observed upon bleomycin injury, suggesting that their development may be a general response to severe lung injury. While intestinal tuft cells promote growth and differentiation of surrounding epithelial cells, in the lungs of tuft cell deficient mice, Krt5+ dysplasia still occurs, goblet cell production is unchanged, and there remains no appreciable contribution of Krt5+ cells into more regionally appropriate alveolar Type 2 cells. Together, these findings highlight unexpected differences in signals necessary for murine lung tuft cell amplification and establish a framework for future elucidation of tuft cell functions in pulmonary health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal microbiota metabolizing Houttuynia cordata polysaccharides in H1N1 induced pneumonia mice contributed to Th17/Treg rebalance in gut-lung axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36084869/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus is intricately linked to dysregulation of gut microbiota and host immunity. Previous study revealed that Houttuynia cordata polysaccharides (HCP) exert the therapeutic effect on influenza A virus inducing lung and intestine damage via regulating pulmonary and intestinal mucosal immunity. However, whether this result was due to the regulation of gut microbiota in the gut-lung axis remains unclear. Here, we firstly found that the elimination of gut microbiota using antibiotic cocktails led to both loss of the protective effect of HCP on intestine and lung injury, and reduction of the efficacy on regulating Th17/Treg balance in gut-lung axis. Fecal microbiota transplantation study confirmed that the gut microbiota fermented with HCP under pathological conditions (H1N1 infection) was responsible for reducing pulmonary and intestinal injury. Moreover, the interaction of HCP and gut microbiota under pathological conditions exhibited not only much more abundant gut microbial diversity, but also higher content of the acetate. Our results demonstrated that the underlying mechanism to ameliorate viral pneumonia in mice involving Th17/Treg rebalance via the gut microbiota and HCP metabolite (acetate) metabolized in pneumonia mice. Our results provided a new insight for macromolecular polysaccharides through targeting intestinal microenvironment reducing distant pulmonary infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections can compromise the physical and biological functionalities of humans and pose a huge economical and psychological burden on infected patients. Nitric oxide (NO) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, whose mechanism of action is not affected by bacterial resistance. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an endogenous donor and carrier of NO, has gained increasing attention because of its potent antibacterial activity and efficient biocompatibility. Significant breakthroughs have been made in the application of GSNO in biomaterials. This review is based on the existing evidence that comprehensively summarizes the progress of antimicrobial GSNO applications focusing on their anti-infective performance, underlying antibacterial mechanisms, and application in anti-infective biomaterials. We provide an accurate overview of the roles and applications of GSNO in antibacterial biomaterials and shed new light on the avenues for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosome from BMMSC Attenuates Cardiopulmonary Bypass-Induced Acute Lung Injury Via YAP/β-Catenin Pathway: Downregulation of Pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36063391/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) accompanied with systemic inflammatory response is an important complication after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Pyroptosis, which is induced by the secretion of inflammatory factors, has been implicated in ALI. However, recent studies have suggested that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMMSC-Exo) can ameliorate ALI, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Therefore, we aim to examine the effects of BMMSC-Exo in CPB-induced ALI, and its underlying mechanism. CPB rat models (male Sprague-Dawley rats) were administered BMMSC-Exo intravenously before induction of ALI. Lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and alveolar macrophage (AM) were collected after the treatments for further analysis, and rat AM NR8383 cells were used for in vitro study. HE staining was performed to detect macrophage infiltration. Western blot was used to detect related proteins expression. And ELISA assay was performed to investigate secretion of inflammatory factors. These results showed that BMMSC-Exo treatment ameliorated macrophage infiltration and oxidative stress, and downregulated expression of pyroptosis-related proteins, including NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, and GSDMD-N, in the lung tissue and AM, as well as decreased the secretion of IL-18 and IL-1β in BALF. Moreover, BMMSC-Exo activated YAP/β-catenin signaling pathway. Overall, these findings of this study indicated that BMMSC-Exo suppressed CPB-induced pyroptosis in ALI by activating YAP/β-catenin axis, which could be a novel strategy for lung protection during CPB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the cGAS-STING Pathway Attenuates Lung Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via Regulating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Alveolar Epithelial Type II Cells of Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36091334/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosol dsDNA sensor, coupling with downstream stimulator of interferon genes (STING) located in the ER, which involves innate immune responses. The aim of our present study was to investigate the effects of cGAS on lung I/R injury via regulating ERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used Sprague-Dawley rats to make the lung I/R model by performing left hilum occlusion-reperfusion surgery. cGAS-specific inhibitor RU.521, STING agonist SR-717, and 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), the ERS inhibitor, were intraperitoneally administered in rats. Double immunofluorescent staining was applied to detect the colocalization of cGAS or BiP, an ERS protein, with alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECIIs) marker. We used transmission electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructure of ER and mitochondria. Apoptosis and oxidative stress in the lungs were assessed, respectively. The profiles of pulmonary edema and lung tissue injury were evaluated. And the pulmonary ventilation function was measured using a spirometer system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In lung I/R rats, the cGAS-STING pathway was upregulated, which implied they were activated. After cGAS-STING pathway was inhibited or activated in lung I/R rats, the ERS was alleviated after cGAS was inhibited, while when STING was activated after lung I/R, ERS was aggravated in the AECIIs, these results suggested that cGAS-STING pathway might trigger ERS responses. Furthermore, activation of cGAS-STING pathway induced increased apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress via regulating ERS and therefore resulted in pulmonary edema and pathological injury in the lungs of I/R rats. Inhibition of cGAS-STING pathway attenuated ERS, therefore attenuated lung injury and promoted pulmonary ventilation function in I/R rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway attenuates lung ischemia/reperfusion injury via alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress in alveolar epithelial type II cells of rats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ischemia and reperfusion injury combined with cisplatin induces immunogenic cell death in lung cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36057637/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first-line chemotherapeutic drug for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), cisplatin (CDDP), fails to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) because it fails to induce calreticulin (CRT) exposure on the cell surface. We investigated the potential of ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R) combined with CDDP to induce ICD in lung cancer cells. The in vitro model of I/R, oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R), effectively induced CRT exposure, ATP secretion, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release and eIF2α phosphorylation in both Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and A549 cells when combined with CDDP. By using a vaccine assay and coculture with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), we showed that OGD/R restored the immunogenicity of CDDP by phosphorylating eIF2α and demonstrated that OGD/R + CDDP (O + C) is an ICD inducer. Using the inguinal tumor model, we found that I/R significantly enhanced the tumor-killing effect of CDDP and Mitomycin C, and this effect relied on adaptive antitumor immunity. Consistently, I + C altered the ratio of interferon-gamma-secreting T lymphocytes, thus overcoming the immunosuppressive effect induced by CDDP. In conclusion, our research presents a new combination strategy and indicates that I/R is a potential anticancer immunogenic modality when combined with nonimmunogenic chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CLEC5A is critical in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced NET formation and acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36048544/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most common nosocomial infections worldwide, and it frequently causes ventilator-associated acute pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Abundant neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to acute lung injury, thereby aggravating ventilator-induced lung damage. While pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) TLR4 and TLR5 are required for host defense against &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; invasion, the PRR responsible for &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced NET formation, proinflammatory cytokine release, and acute lung injury remains unclear. We found that myeloid C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A) interacts with LPS of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; and is responsible for &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced NET formation and lung inflammation. &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; activates CLEC5A to induce caspase-1-dependent NET formation, but it neither causes gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage nor contributes to &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced neutrophil death. Blockade of CLEC5A attenuates &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced NETosis and lung injury, and simultaneous administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb with ciprofloxacin increases survival rate and decreases collagen deposition in the lungs of mice challenged with a lethal dose of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, CLEC5A is a promising therapeutic target to reduce ventilator-associated lung injury and fibrosis in &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms of Zedoary Turmeric Oil Injection against lipopolysaccharides-induced acute lung injury in rats elucidated by network pharmacology combined with transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36099655/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Prospects for the drug treatment of acute lung injury (ALI) is unpromising. Managing inflammation can prevent ALI from progressing and minimize further deterioration. Zedoary turmeric oil injection (ZTOI), a patented traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that has been used against ALI, has shown significant anti-inflammatory effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism by which ZTOI acts against ALI in rats using an ingredients-targets-pathways (I-T-P) interaction network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design and methods:&lt;/em&gt; The key ingredients of ZTOI were characterized using UPLC-MS/MS combined with literature mining. The target profiles of each ingredient were established using drug-target databases. The anti-inflammatory activity of ZTOI against lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced rat ALI was validated using histopathology and inflammatory factor assessments. The therapeutic targets of ZTOI were screened by integrating transcriptomic results of lung tissues with protein-protein interaction (PPI) expansion. Using KEGG pathway enrichment, an I-T-P network was established to determine the essential interactions among ingredients, targets, and pathways of ZTOI against lung inflammation in ALI. Molecular docking and immunofluorescence staining were utilized to confirm the accuracy of the I-T-P network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 11 sesquiterpenes, whose target profiles may characterize the potential function of ZTOI, were identified as key ingredients. In the ALI rat model, ZTOI can alleviate lung inflammation by decreasing the levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α both in serum and lung tissues. Based on our biological samples, transcriptomics, PPI network expansion, and KEGG pathway enrichment, 11 ingredients, 174 targets, and 8 signaling pathways were linked in the I-T-P networks. From these results, ZTOI could be inferred to exert multiple anti-inflammatory effects against ALI through Toll-like receptor, NF-kappa B, RIG-I-like receptor, TNF, NOD-like receptor, IL-17, MAPK, and the Toll and Imd signaling pathways. In addition, two significantly regulated targets in the transcriptome, Usp18 and Map3k7, could be the essential anti-inflammatory targets of ZTOI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; By integrating network pharmacology with ingredient identification and transcriptomics, we show the multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms by which ZTOI acts against ALI on an I-T-P level. This work also provides a methodological reference for related research into TCM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phenotypic drug screen uncovers the metabolic GCH1/BH4 pathway as key regulator of EGFR/KRAS-mediated neuropathic pain and lung cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36044597/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) generated in injured sensory neurons contributes to increased pain sensitivity and its persistence. GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo BH4 synthetic pathway, and human single-nucleotide polymorphism studies, together with mouse genetic modeling, have demonstrated that decreased GCH1 leads to both reduced BH4 and pain. However, little is known about the regulation of &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression upon nerve injury and whether this could be modulated as an analgesic therapeutic intervention. We performed a phenotypic screen using about 1000 bioactive compounds, many of which are target-annotated FDA-approved drugs, for their effect on regulating &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression in rodent injured dorsal root ganglion neurons. From this approach, we uncovered relevant pathways that regulate &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression in sensory neurons. We report that EGFR/KRAS signaling triggers increased &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression and contributes to neuropathic pain; conversely, inhibiting EGFR suppressed GCH1 and BH4 and exerted analgesic effects, suggesting a molecular link between EGFR/KRAS and pain perception. We also show that GCH1/BH4 acts downstream of KRAS to drive lung cancer, identifying a potentially druggable pathway. Our screen shows that pharmacologic modulation of GCH1 expression and BH4 could be used to develop pharmacological treatments to alleviate pain and identified a critical role for EGFR-regulated GCH1/BH4 expression in neuropathic pain and cancer in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poldip2 knockdown protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via Nox4/Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymerase δ-interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) has been reported to mediate acute lung injury (ALI); however, the underlying mechanism is not fully explored. Male C57BL/6 mice and A549 cells were used to establish the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model, then the expression of Poldip2 and its effect on oxidative stress and the resulting inflammation were detected. Adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) mediated Poldip2 knockdown was transfected into mice via intratracheal atomization. And A549 cells stimulated with LPS was used to further confirm our hypothesis in vitro. ML385, specifically inhibited the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Our data suggested that LPS stimulation remarkably increased protein levels of Nox4 and p-P65, activities of NADPH and MPO, and generation of ROS, TNF-α, and IL-1β while decreased protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 compared with those in NC shRNA + Saline group, which were obviously reversed by Poldip2 knockdown. Concomitantly, Poldip2 knockdown dramatically reduced contents of MDA and enhanced activities of SOD and GSH-Px compared to NC shRNA + LPS group. In vitro, we found that knockdown of Poldip2 significantly reversed LPS-induced increase protein levels of Nox4 and p-P65, activity of NADPH, and generation of ROS, TNF-α, and IL-1β, and decrease protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1, ML385 pretreatment reversed the effects of Poldip2 knockdown mentioned above. Our study indicated that Poldip2 knockdown alleviates LPS-induced ALI via inhibiting Nox4/Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diacerein attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ER stress and apoptosis: Impact on the crosstalk between SphK1/S1P, TLR4/NFκB/STAT3, and NLRP3/IL-1β signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36055546/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening clinical problem with high mortality rate and limited treatments or preventive options that represents a major challenge for clinicians. Diacerein (DIA) is a multi-target anthraquinone derivative with potent anti-inflammatory action. The aim of this study is to assess the protective effect of DIA and its potential molecular targets against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administrated DIA (50 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (5mg/kg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; DIA mitigated oxidative lung injury in LPS-challenged rats via significantly decreasing lung wet/dry (W/D) ratio, inflammatory cells infiltration, and lipid peroxidation, with concomitant elevation in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels in lung tissue. Likewise, DIA alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress and markedly halted inflammation triggered by LPS challenge in pulmonary tissue by suppressing NLRP3/IL-1β and TLR4/NF-κB signaling with parallel decrease in proinflammatory cytokine levels. Interestingly, DIA down regulated Sphk1/S1P axis, reduced GSK-3β and STAT3 proteins expression, and markedly decreased caspase-3 besides increasing Bcl-2 levels in lung tissue of LPS-challenged animals. These biochemical findings was simultaneously associated with marked improvement in histological alterations of lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; These findings verify the protective effect of DIA against LPS-induced ALI through targeting oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis. Importantly, DIA halted the hyperinflammatory state triggered by LPS via multi-faceted inhibitory effect on different signaling pathways, hence DIA could potentially reduce mortality in patients with ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel Requirement for Staphylococcal Cell Wall-Anchored Protein SasD in Pulmonary Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36040164/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; can complicate preceding viral infections, including influenza virus. A bacterial infection combined with a preceding viral infection, known as superinfection, leads to worse outcomes than a single infection. Most of the pulmonary infection literature focuses on the changes in immune responses to bacteria between homeostatic and virally infected lungs. However, it is unclear how much of an influence bacterial virulence factors have in single or superinfection. Staphylococcal species express a broad range of cell wall-anchored proteins (CWAs) that have roles in host adhesion, nutrient acquisition, and immune evasion. We screened the importance of these CWAs using mutants lacking individual CWAs in vivo in both bacterial pneumonia and influenza superinfection. In bacterial pneumonia, the lack of individual CWAs leads to various decreases in bacterial burden, lung damage, and immune infiltration into the lung. However, the presence of a preceding influenza infection partially abrogates the requirement for CWAs. In the screen, we found that the uncharacterized CWA &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; surface protein D (SasD) induced changes in both inflammatory and homeostatic lung markers. We further characterized a SasD mutant (sasD A50.1) in the context of pneumonia. Mice infected with sasD A50.1 have decreased bacterial burden, inflammatory responses, and mortality compared to wild-type &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;. Mice also have reduced levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), likely derived from macrophages. Reductions in IL-1β transcript levels as well as increased macrophage viability point at differences in cell death pathways. These data identify a novel virulence factor for &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; that influences inflammatory signaling within the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; is a common commensal bacterium that can cause severe infections, such as pneumonia. In the lung, viral infections increase the risk of staphylococcal pneumonia, leading to combined infections known as superinfections. The most common virus associated with &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; pneumonia is influenza, and superinfections lead to worse patient outcomes than either infection alone. While there is much known about how the immune system differs between healthy and virally infected lungs, the role of bacterial virulence factors in single and superinfection is less understood. The significance of our research is identifying bacterial components that play a role in the initiation of lung injury, which could lead to future therapies to prevent pulmonary single or superinfection with &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of immune response in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: far beyond the Th1/Th2 imbalance</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35983984/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease of unknown origin characterized by progressive scarring of the lung leading to irreversible loss of function. Despite the availability of two drugs that are able to slow down disease progression, IPF remains a deadly disease. The pathogenesis of IPF is poorly understood, but a dysregulated wound healing response following recurrent alveolar epithelial injury is thought to be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Areas covered:&lt;/em&gt; In the last few years, the role of the immune system in IPF pathobiology has been reconsidered; indeed, recent data suggest that a dysfunctional immune system may promote and unfavorable interplay with pro-fibrotic pathways thus acting as a cofactor in disease development and progression. In this article, we review and critically discuss the role of T cells in the pathogenesis and progression of IPF in the attempt to highlight ways in which further research in this area may enable the development of targeted immunomodulatory therapies for this dreadful disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expert opinion:&lt;/em&gt; A better understanding of T cell interactions has the potential to facilitate the development of immune modulators targeting multiple T cell-mediated pathways, thus halting disease initiation and progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcriptome analysis identifies IL24 as an autophagy modulator in PM2.5 caused lung dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36049333/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36049333/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transcriptome analysis revealed the relationship between PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; exposure and autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; exposure led to lung pathological changes in mouse model via autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL24 was identified as a potential target associated with PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;-induced autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L24 was regulated by inhibition of mTOR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Evidence suggests that exposure to PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; increased hospitalization and mortality rates of respiratory diseases. However, the potential biomarkers and targets associated with PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;-induced lung dysfunction are not fully discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and HALLMARK enrichment analysis of the RNA-seq data (Beas-2B cells treated with PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;) were applied. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify the biological processes correlated with autophagy. Three gene expression profile datasets (GSE158954, GSE155616 and GSE182199) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify the potential targets. PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;-exposed mice were constructed. Real-time qPCR, siRNA transfection, western blot, immunofluorescence, and pathological staining were applied for validation both in vitro and in vivo studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; GO, KEGG and HALLMARK enrichment based on RNA-seq data showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were associated with autophagy like lysosome and macroautophagy. GSEA analysis revealed that PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; was positively correlated with autophagy-related biological processes compared with control group. Venn diagrams identified IL24 was upregulated in our data as well as in these three datasets (GSE158954, GSE155616 and GSE182199) after PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; exposure. Consistent with the analysis, activation of autophagy by PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; was validated in vivo and in vitro. In PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;-exposed mice, lung pathological changes were observed, including airway inflammation and mucus secretion. The mRNA and protein levels of the key gene, IL24, were significantly increased. Moreover, Bafilomycin A1, the inhibitor of autophagy, inhibited the autophagy and ameliorated lung injury induced by PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, downregulation of IL24 decreased autophagy activity. Meanwhile, IL24 was regulated by mTOR signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, we discovered a potential relationship between IL24 and autophagy during PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; exposure. IL24 might be a novel potential biomarker or therapeutic target in PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; caused lung dysfunction through regulation of autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung-Targeted Delivery of Cepharanthine by an Erythrocyte-Anchoring Strategy for the Treatment of Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36145566/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the most frequent complications of critical illness, acute lung injury (ALI) carries a high risk of clinical morbidity and mortality. Cepharanthine (CPA) has significant anti-inflammatory activity, however, due to poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and short half-life, it fails to provide effective clinical management measures. Here, we explored the flexibility of an erythrocyte-anchoring strategy using CPA-encapsulated chitosan-coating nanoparticles (CPA-CNPs) anchored onto circulating erythrocytes for the treatment of ALI. CPA-CNPs adhered to erythrocytes successfully (E-CPA-CNPs) and exhibited high erythrocyte adhesion efficiency (&amp;gt;80%). Limited toxicity and favorable biocompatibility enabled further application of E-CPA-CNPs. Next, the reticuloendothelial system evasion features were analyzed in RAW264.7 macrophages and Sprague-Dawley rats. Compared with bare CPA-CNPs, erythrocyte-anchored CNPs significantly decreased cellular uptake in immune cells and prolonged circulation time in vivo. Notably, the erythrocyte-anchoring strategy enabled CNPs to be delivered and accumulated in the lungs (up to 6-fold). In the ALI mouse model, E-CPA-CNPs attenuated the progression of ALI by inhibiting inflammatory responses. Overall, our results demonstrate the outstanding advantages of erythrocyte-anchored CPA-CNPs in improving the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of CPA, which offers great promise for a lung-targeted drug delivery system for the effective treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-217-5p inhibits smog (PM2.5)-induced inflammation and oxidative stress response of mouse lung tissues and macrophages through targeting STAT1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36040387/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To explore the roles of macrophages&amp;rsquo; miR-217-5p in the process of PM2.5 induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; GEO database and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis as well as GSEA were used to predicted the miRNA and associated target signals. And then mice and RAW246.7 macrophages treated with PM2.5 to imitate PM2.5 induced acute lung injury environment and then transfected with miR-217-5p NC or miR-217-5p mimic. The levels of inflammatory factors TNF-α and anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 of mice serum were tested by ELISA. And the pathological changes and ROS level of mouse lung tissues were stained by HE and DHE staining. The proteins expression of phosphorylated-STAT1, total-STAT1, TNF-α, IFN-γ as well as p47, gp91, NOX4 in mice or RAW264.7 cells were tested by western blot or immunofluorescence of RAW264.7 cell slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results of bioinformatics analysis indicated the miR-217 as well as STAT1 were involved PM2.5 associated lung injury. After exposure to PM2.5, the decreased levels of serum TNF-α but not IL-10, consistent with reduced macrophages&amp;rsquo; accumulation as well as decreased ROS levels in lung tissues in miR-217-5p mimic group vs miR-217-5p NC group mice, and moreover, the protein expression levels of phosphorylated&amp;ndash;STAT1, total-STAT1, TNF-α, IFN-γ, p47, gp91 and NOX4 in mouse lung tissues and RTAW246.7 macrophages cells were all significantly reduced with miR-217-5p mimic administration. The above phenomena were reversed by specific STAT1-inhibitor HY-N8107.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; miR-217-5p suppressed the activated STAT1-signal induced inflammation and oxidative stress trigged by PM2.5 in macrophages and resulted in the decreased lung injure caused by PM2.5.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myeloid- and Epithelial-derived Heparin-Binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like Growth Factor Promotes Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36036796/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a poorly understood, progressive lethal lung disease with no known cure. In addition to alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injury and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, chronic inflammation is a hallmark of IPF. Literature suggests that the persistent inflammation seen in IPF primarily consists of monocytes and macrophages. Recent work demonstrates that monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (moAMs) drive lung fibrosis, but further characterization of critical moAM cell attributes is necessary. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is an important epidermal growth factor receptor ligand that has essential roles in angiogenesis, wound healing, keratinocyte migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Our past work has shown HB-EGF is a primary marker of profibrotic M2 macrophages, and this study seeks to characterize myeloid-derived HB-EGF and its primary mechanism of action in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis using &lt;em&gt;Hbegf&lt;sup&gt;f/f&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Lyz2Cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Here, we show that patients with IPF and mice with pulmonary fibrosis have increased expression of HB-EGF and that lung macrophages and transitional AECs of mice with pulmonary fibrosis and humans all express HB-EGF. We also show that &lt;em&gt;Hbegf&lt;sup&gt;f/f&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Lyz2Cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice are protected from bleomycin-induced fibrosis and that this protection is likely multifactorial, caused by decreased CCL2-dependent monocyte migration, decreased fibroblast migration, and decreased contribution of HB-EGF from AEC sources when HB-EGF is removed under the Lyz2Cre promoter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicosis is one of the severest occupational diseases worldwide, manifesting as infiltration of inflammatory cells, excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and pulmonary diffuse fibrosis. Macrophages polarization to M2 is one of the major strategies that attenuates inflammatory response. Our previous study found that vitamin D could protect against silica-induced lung injury by damping the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here we further identified that vitamin D attenuated silica particles-induced lung inflammation by regulating macrophage polarization in a KLF4-STAT6 manner. Myeloid-specific Stat6 knockout (cKO) mice were generated for in vivo studies. Primary macrophages purified from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of wildtype or Stat6 cKO mice and differentiated THP-1 cells were used for in vitro studies. Vitamin D was found to promote alveolar macrophage polarizing to M2 phenotype through the STAT6 signaling pathway, as demonstrated by worse lung inflammation and ablated protection of vitamin D in silica particles-instilled Stat6 cKO mice. Mechanismly, vitamin D upregulated KLF4 expression in the alveolar macrophage, which synergistically activated STAT6. Additionally, KLF4 was found to upregulate macrophages autophagy, which protected them from silica particles-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. The protective effects of vitamin D were dismissed by silencing KLF4. Our study demonstrates the potential mechanism of vitamin D-mediated macrophage polarization and reveals the therapeutic application of vitamin D in inflammatory disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anti-Fibrotic Effect of SDF-1β Overexpression in Bleomycin-Injured Rat Lung</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36145551/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rational:&lt;/em&gt; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease and is associated with high mortality due to a lack of effective treatment. Excessive deposition of the extracellular matrix by activated myofibroblasts in the alveolar space leads to scar formation that hinders gas exchange. Therefore, selectively removing activated myofibroblasts with the aim to repair and remodel fibrotic lungs is a promising approach. Stromal-derived growth factor (SDF-1) is known to stimulate cellular signals which attract stem cells to the site of injury for tissue repair and remodeling. Here, we investigate the effect of overexpression of SDF-1β on lung structure using the bleomycin-injured rat lung model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Intratracheal administration of bleomycin was performed in adult male rats (F344). Seven days later, in vivo electroporation-mediated gene transfer of either SDF-1β or the empty vector was performed. Animals were sacrificed seven days after gene transfer and histology, design-based stereology, flow cytometry, and collagen measurement were performed on the tissue collected. For in vitro experiments, lung fibroblasts obtained from IPF patients were used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Seven days after SDF-1β gene transfer to bleomycin-injured rat lungs, reduced total collagen, reduced collagen fibrils, improved histology and induced apoptosis of myofibroblasts were observed. Furthermore, it was revealed that TNF-α mediates SDF-1β-induced apoptosis of myofibroblasts; moreover, SDF-1β overexpression increased alveolar epithelial cell numbers and proliferation in vivo and also induced their migration in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study demonstrates a new antifibrotic mechanism of SDF-1β overexpression and suggests SDF-1β as a potential new approach for the treatment of lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil extracellular traps-triggered impaired autophagic flux via METTL3 underlies sepsis-associated acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36030287/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) assist pathogen clearance, while excessive NETs formation is associated with exacerbated inflammatory responses and tissue injury in acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Autophagy is generally considered to be a protective process, but autophagy dysfunction is harmful. Whether and how NETs affect autophagic flux during sepsis-induced ALI are currently unknown. Here, we confirmed that the level of NETs was increased in ARDS patients and mice models, which led to impairment of autophagic flux and deterioration of the disease. Mechanistically, NETs activated METTL3 mediated m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation of Sirt1 mRNA in alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in abnormal autophagy. These findings provide new insights into how NETs contribute to the development of sepsis-associated ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plasma Cell-Free DNA Predicts Survival and Maps Specific Sources of Injury in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36004627/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a noninvasive marker of cellular injury. Its significance in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Plasma cfDNA was measured in 2 PAH cohorts (A, n=48; B, n=161) and controls (n=48). Data were collected for REVEAL 2.0 (Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management) scores and outcome determinations. Patients were divided into the following REVEAL risk groups: low (≤6), medium (7-8), and high (≥9). Total cfDNA concentrations were compared among controls and PAH risk groups by 1-way analysis of variance. Log-rank tests compared survival between cfDNA tertiles and REVEAL risk groups. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were estimated from logistic regression models. A sample subset from cohort B (n=96) and controls (n=16) underwent bisulfite sequencing followed by a deconvolution algorithm to map cell-specific cfDNA methylation patterns, with concentrations compared using t tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In cohort A, median (interquartile range) age was 62 years (47-71), with 75% female, and median (interquartile range) REVEAL 2.0 was 6 (4-9). In cohort B, median (interquartile range) age was 59 years (49-71), with 69% female, and median (interquartile range) REVEAL 2.0 was 7 (6-9). In both cohorts, cfDNA concentrations differed among patients with PAH of varying REVEAL risk and controls (analysis of variance _P_≤0.002) and were greater in the high-risk compared with the low-risk category (_P_≤0.002). In cohort B, death or lung transplant occurred in 14 of 54, 23 of 53, and 35 of 54 patients in the lowest, middle, and highest cfDNA tertiles, respectively. cfDNA levels stratified as tertiles (log-rank: &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.0001) and REVEAL risk groups (log-rank: &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) each predicted transplant-free survival. The addition of cfDNA to REVEAL improved discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.72-0.78; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.02). Compared with controls, methylation analysis in patients with PAH revealed increased cfDNA originating from erythrocyte progenitors, neutrophils, monocytes, adipocytes, natural killer cells, vascular endothelium, and cardiac myocytes (Bonferroni adjusted &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). cfDNA concentrations derived from erythrocyte progenitor cells, cardiac myocytes, and vascular endothelium were greater in patients with PAH with high-risk versus low-risk REVEAL scores (_P_≤0.02).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Circulating cfDNA is elevated in patients with PAH, correlates with disease severity, and predicts worse survival. Results from cfDNA methylation analyses in patients with PAH are consistent with prevailing paradigms of disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cephalosporins-induced intestinal dysbiosis exacerbated pulmonary endothelial barrier disruption in streptococcus pneumoniae-infected mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36093187/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic abuse is growing more severe in clinic, and even short-term antibiotic treatment can cause long-term gut dysbiosis, which may promote the development and aggravation of diseases. Cephalosporins as the broad-spectrum antibiotics are widely used for prevention and treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in children. However, their potential consequences in health and disease have not been fully elaborated. In this study, the effects of cefaclor, cefdinir and cefixime on intestinal microbiota and lung injury were investigated in &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; (Spn)-infected mice. The results showed that the proportion of coccus and bacillus in intestinal microbiota were changed after oral administration with cefaclor, cefdinir and cefixime twice for 10 days, respectively. Compared with the Spn-infected group, the proportion of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; in intestine were significantly reduced, while Enterococcus and Candida was increased after cephalosporin treatment. Furthermore, 3 cephalosporins could obviously increase the number of total cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes in BALF as well as the serum levels of endotoxin, IL-2, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Mechanically, cephalosporins accelerated Spn-induced pulmonary barrier dysfunction via mediating the mRNA expressions of endothelial barrier-related proteins (Claudin 5, Occludin, and ZO-1) and inflammation-related proteins (TLR4, p38 and NF-κB). However, all of those consequences could be partly reversed by &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium bifidum&lt;/em&gt; treatment, which was closely related to the elevated acetate production, indicating the protective effects of probiotic against antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that oral administration with cephalosporins not only disrupted intestinal microecological homeostasis, but also increased the risk of Spn infection, resulting in severer respiratory inflammation and higher bacterial loads in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intermittent fasting attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice by modulating macrophage polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028098/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a spectrum of acute and life-threatening pulmonary inflammatory conditions. Treatment of ALI remains a clinical challenge. Recently, intermittent fasting (IF) has been shown to improve health and alleviate many diseases. In this study, we tested whether IF attenuated ALI and investigated the mechanism underlying this process. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, the effects of IF on ALI were evaluated in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine ALI model. We found that two times of 24-h fasting in a week before ALI efficiently ameliorated LPS-induced lung injury in mice, characterized by alleviated lung lesions, wet-to-dry weight ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde content, and lower levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, functional assays were conducted to assess IF on the inflammatory response and macrophage polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with LPS or IL-4. And PPARγ antagonist GW9662 and AMPK siRNA were used to test the role of PPARγ and AMPK in the IF-mediated improvement of ALI. The results showed that IF (serum deprivation) suppressed macrophage M1 activation and promoted M2 activation in LPS-treated BMDMs. While, IF also augmented macrophage M2 polarization in IL-4-treated BMDMs. Further mechanistic studies showed that the promotive effect of IF on M2 polarization was related to the activation of the PPARγ and AMPK pathways. In conclusion, this study suggests that IF enhances M2 polarization by activating the AMPK and PPARγ pathways, thus facilitating anti-inflammatory response and ameliorating ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obesity reprograms the pulmonary polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived lipidome, transcriptome, and gene-oxylipin networks</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028048/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity exacerbates inflammation upon lung injury; however, the mechanisms by which obesity primes pulmonary dysregulation prior to external injury are not well studied. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that obesity dysregulates pulmonary PUFA metabolism that is central to inflammation initiation and resolution. We first show that a high-fat diet (HFD) administered to C57BL/6J mice increased the relative abundance of pulmonary PUFA-containing triglycerides and the concentration of PUFA-derived oxylipins (particularly prostaglandins and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids), independent of an increase in total pulmonary PUFAs, prior to onset of pulmonary inflammation. Experiments with a genetic model of obesity (ob/ob) generally recapitulated the effects of the HFD on the pulmonary oxylipin signature. Subsequent pulmonary next-generation RNA sequencing identified complex and unique transcriptional regulation with the HFD. We found the HFD increased pathways related to glycerophospholipid metabolism and immunity, including a unique elevation in B cell differentiation and signaling. Furthermore, we conducted computational integration of lipidomic with transcriptomic data. These analyses identified novel HFD-driven networks between glycerophospholipid metabolism and B cell receptor signaling with specific PUFA-derived pulmonary oxylipins. Finally, we confirmed the hypothesis by demonstrating that the concentration of pulmonary oxylipins, in addition to inflammatory markers, were generally increased in mice consuming a HFD upon ozone-induced acute lung injury. Collectively, these data show that a HFD dysregulates pulmonary PUFA metabolism prior to external lung injury, which may be a mechanism by which obesity primes the lungs to respond poorly to infectious and/or inflammatory challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is a pathological process that occurs in numerous organs throughout the human body and is frequently associated with severe cellular damage and death. Puerarin is an isoflavone compound extracted from the root of Pueraria lobata and has pharmacological effects such as dilating cerebral vessels and anti-free radical generation in cerebral ischemic tissues. With the deepening of experimental research and clinical research on puerarin, it has been found that puerarin has a protective effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of the heart, brain, spinal cord, lung, intestine and other organs. In summary, puerarin has a vast range of pharmacological effects and significant protective effects, and it also has obvious advantages in the clinical protection of patients with organ IRI. With the deepening of experimental pharmacological research and clinical research, it is expected to be an effective drug for IRI treatment. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the protective effect of puerarin on I/R organ injury and its possible underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pyrogallol enhances therapeutic effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells against LPS-mediated inflammation and lung injury via activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028178/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenges in clinical applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attributed to their heterogeneity. It is believed that preconditioning of MSCs with active compounds may enhance the expression of potentially therapeutic molecules and thus achieve stable and effective therapeutic outcomes. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which pyrogallol increased the therapeutic efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) against LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI). hUCMSCs with pyrogallol treatment increased expression of HO-1 at both mRNA and protein levels, accompanied by Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1 (Keap1) degradation, and upregulation of the Nrf2 protein levels as well as nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Moreover, the modulation of Keap1 and Nrf2 as well as HO-1 upregulation by pyrogallol was reversed by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and a P38 kinase inhibitor (SB203580). Whereas, NAC pretreatment abrogated pyrogallol-mediated activation of P38 kinase, indicating that pyrogallol-derived ROS led to P38 kinase activation, thus promoting Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Additionally, we found that the induction of p62 by the pyrogallol-mediated ROS/P38/Nrf2 axis interacted with Keap1 and resulted in autophagic degradation of Keap1, which created a positive feedback loop to further release of Nrf2. Furthermore, the increased expression of HO-1 in pyrogallol-pretreated hUCMSCs led to enhanced inhibitory effects on LPS-mediated TLR4/P-P65 signaling in BEAS-2B cells, resulting in increasing suppression of LPS-indued expression of a series of pro-inflammatory mediators. Compared to untreated hUCMSCs, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with pyrogallol-primed hUCMSCs transplantation showed enhanced improvements in LPS-mediated lung pathological alterations, the increased lung index (lung/body ratio), apoptosis of epithelial cells, the activation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling as well as the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Together, these results suggested that hUCMSCs with pyrogallol pretreatment enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSCs, which may provide a promising therapeutic strategy to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSC-based therapy for treating LPS-associated ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antibiotic-resistant &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; (Kp) has become a significant crisis in treating pneumonia. Low-frequency ultrasound (LFU) is promising to overcome the obstacles. Mice were infected with bioluminescent Kp Xen39 by intratracheal injection to study the therapeutic effect of LFU in combination with antibiotics. The counts per second (CPS) were assessed with an animal biophoton imaging system. Bacterial clearance, histopathology, and the concentrations of cytokines were determined to evaluate the therapeutic effect. LC-MS/MS was used to detect the distribution of antibiotics in the lung and plasma. LFU in combination with meropenem (MEM) or amikacin (AMK) significantly improved the behavioural state of mice. The CPS of the LFU combination group were more significantly decreased compared with those of the antibiotic alone groups. The average colony-forming units of lung tissue in the LFU combination groups were also lower than those of the antibiotic groups. Although no significant changes of cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were observed, LFU in combination with antibiotics showed less inflammatory damage from histopathological results compared with the antibiotic-alone groups. Moreover, 10 min of LFU treatment promoted the distribution of MEM and AMK in mouse lung tissue at 60 and 30 min, respectively, after dosage. LFU could enhance the effectiveness of MEM and AMK in the treatment of Kp-induced pneumonia, which might be attributed to the fact that LFU could promote the distribution of antibiotics in lung tissue and reduce inflammatory injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generation of Plvap-CreER and Car4-CreER for genetic targeting of distinct lung capillary populations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028133/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been reported recently that there are two distinct subpopulations of capillary endothelial cells in the mammalian lungs: gCap (general capillary) and aCap (aerocyte). They are identified by two unique markers, respectively: plasmalemmal vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP) and carbonic anhydrase IV (CAR4). Here, we report two novel knock-in mouse lines Plvap-CreER and Car4-CreER, which genetically target gCap and aCap, respectively. Induced by tamoxifen, the Plvap-CreER and Car4-CreER alleles mediate specific and efficient Cre-loxP recombinations in PLVAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gCap and CAR4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; aCap, respectively, in the lungs. These two mouse lines are useful genetic tools to investigate cell fates and functions of PLVAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CAR4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in lung homeostasis, injury and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simultaneous Monitoring of HOCl and Viscosity with Drug-Induced Pyroptosis in Live Cells and Acute Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis is a newly identified form of cell death that is closely correlated with many diseases. Recent studies have indicated that the inflammation in pyroptosis would accelerate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, intracellular viscosity is another key microenvironmental parameter that reflects many physiological and pathological states in the early stage, hypochlorous acid (HOCl), as an important ROS, also plays significant roles in a variety of pathologies. However, the fluctuation of viscosity and HOCl in the process of pyroptosis is still unknown. Herein, we present a dual-responsive fluorescent probe (Lyso-VH) for simultaneously detecting viscosity and HOCl. Lyso-VH was successfully used to image the fluctuation of HOCl and viscosity in the lysosome of three kinds of cells with dependent and independent channels. Moreover, Lyso-VH can be employed to investigate the changes of HOCl and viscosity during the process of pyroptosis in living cells and acute lung injury (ALI). Thus, this work can not only serve as a powerful tool to simultaneously visualize the fluctuation of HOCl and viscosity in lysosomes, but also provide a new insight into drug-induced pyroptosis in living cells and acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effect of invasive mechanical ventilation on the diversity of the pulmonary microbiota</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary microbial diversity may be influenced by biotic or abiotic conditions (e.g., disease, smoking, invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), etc.). Specially, invasive MV may trigger structural and physiological changes in both tissue and microbiota of lung, due to gastric and oral microaspiration, altered body posture, high O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation-induced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; toxicity in hypoxemic patients, impaired airway clearance and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which in turn reduce the diversity of the pulmonary microbiota and may ultimately lead to poor prognosis. Furthermore, changes in (local) O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration can reduce the diversity of the pulmonary microbiota by affecting the local immune microenvironment of lung. In conclusion, systematic literature studies have found that invasive MV reduces pulmonary microbiota diversity, and future rational regulation of pulmonary microbiota diversity by existing or novel clinical tools (e.g., lung probiotics, drugs) may improve the prognosis of invasive MV treatment and lead to more effective treatment of lung diseases with precision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Increased expression and accumulation of GDF15 in IPF extracellular matrix contribute to fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35993367/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease of unmet medical need. It is characterized by formation of scar tissue leading to a progressive and irreversible decline in lung function. IPF is associated with repeated injury, which may alter the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we demonstrate that IPF patient-derived pulmonary ECM drives profibrotic response in normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) in a 3D spheroid assay. Next, we reveal distinct alterations in composition of the diseased ECM, identifying potentially novel associations with IPF. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) was identified among the most significantly upregulated proteins in the IPF lung-derived ECM. In vivo, GDF15 neutralization in a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model led to significantly less fibrosis. In vitro, recombinant GDF15 (rGDF15) stimulated α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression in NHLF, and this was mediated by the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) receptor. Furthermore, in the presence of rGDF15, the migration of NHLF in collagen gel was reduced. In addition, we observed a cell type-dependent effect of GDF15 on the expression of cell senescence markers. Our data suggest that GDF15 mediates lung fibrosis through fibroblast activation and differentiation, implicating a potential direct role of this matrix-associated cytokine in promoting aberrant cell responses in disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct exposure to formaldehyde can cause lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircRNAs involvement in formaldehyde-induced lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rno_circRNA_008646 contributed to formaldehyde induced lung injury through rno-miR-224 mediated FOXI1/CFTR axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formaldehyde (FA) serves as a prevailing air pollutant, which has seriously threatened public health in recent years. Of all the known health effects, lung injury is one of the most severe risks. However, little is known about the circRNAs related molecular mechanism in the development of lung injury induced by FA. This study was designed to explore the potential roles of dysregulated circRNAs as well as its mechanism in FA-induced lung injury. In the present study, 24 male SD rats were exposed to formaldehyde (control, 0.5, 2.46 and 5 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for 8 h per day for 8 weeks to induce lung injury. We used H&amp;amp;E staining to evaluate the histopathological changes of lung injury indifferent groups. The expression of circRNAs in lung tissue was detected by real-time PCR. Meanwhile, circRNA/miRNA/mRNA interaction networks were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Our study revealed that formaldehyde exposure resulted in abnormal histopathological changes in lung tissues. Moreover, the expression of rno_circRNA_008646 was significantly higher in lung tissues of formaldehyde exposure rats than in control. Bioinformatics analysis showed that one potential target miRNA/mRNA for rno_circRNA_008646 was rno-miR-224/Forkhead Box I1 (FOXI1). Besides, luciferase report gene confirmed that there was targeted binding relationship between rno_circRNA_008646 and rno-miR-224, rno-miR-224 and FOXI1. Further verification experiments indicated that the expression of rno_circRNA_008646 was negatively correlated rno-miR-224, while it was positively correlated with FOXI1. JASPAR database showed transcription factor FOXI1 located in promotor of CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). Both FOXI1 and CFTR were up-regulated in lung tissues after formaldehyde exposure. In conclusion, our findings suggested that formaldehyde may induce lung injury, and this may be caused by up-regulatedrno_circRNA_008646, which medicated rno-miR-224/FOXI1/CFTR axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acteoside attenuates RSV-induced lung injury by suppressing necroptosis and regulating metabolism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36059973/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Necroptosis and inflammation are closely related to the pathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Acteoside (AC), a natural phenylpropanoid glycoside from Kuding Tea, has significant anti-RSV effect. However, the roles of AC on RSV-induced lung necroptosis and inflammation are yet to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The effects of AC were investigated in BALB/c mice and A549 cells. Lung histopathology was observed through H&amp;amp;E staining. The viral titer was assessed via plaque assay. The RSV-F expression was determined by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry assay. The levels of cytokines were detected by ELISA and RT-qPCR. The necroptosis rate and mitochondrial membrane potential were evaluated via flow cytometry. The expressions of HMGB1/NF-κB and RIP1/RIP3/MLKL/PGAM5/DRP1 were detected by western blot. Additionally, untargeted metabolomics was conducted to investigate the metabolic profiles and related metabolic pathways via Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that compared with the RSV-infected group, AC treatment significantly attenuated lung pathological damage, virus replication, and cytokines levels. AC also alleviated RSV-induced necroptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Moreover, AC treatment down-regulated the expression of HMGB1, p-Iκbα/Iκbα, p-p65/p65, RIP1, RIP3, MLKL, PGAM5, and DRP1. Furthermore, metabolomic analyses suggested that the perturbations in major metabolites of AC therapy were related to variations in amino acid and energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings validated the beneficial effects of AC in suppressing necroptosis and regulating metabolism, suggesting AC may be a new drug candidate for RSV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antioxidant mitoquinone ameliorates EtOH-LPS induced lung injury by inhibiting mitophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36059543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic ethanol abuse is a systemic disorder and a risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. One explanation is that ethanol produces damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disturbs the balance of mitochondria within the lungs to promote a pro-injury environment. We hypothesized that targeting an antioxidant to the mitochondria would prevent oxidative damage and attenuate EtOH-LPS-induced lung injury. To test this, we investigated the effects of mitochondria-targeted ubiquinone, Mitoquinone (MitoQ) on ethanol-sensitized lung injury induced by LPS. Lung inflammation, ROS, mitochondria function, and mitophagy were assessed. We demonstrated that chronic ethanol feeding sensitized the lung to LPS-induced lung injury with significantly increased reactive oxygen species ROS level and mitochondrial injury as well as lung cellular NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These deleterious effects were attenuated by MitoQ administration in mice. The protective effects of MitoQ are associated with decreased cellular mitophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Taken together, our results demonstrated that ethanol aggravated LPS-induced lung injury, and antioxidant MitoQ protects from EtOH-LPS-induced lung injury, probably through reducing mitophagy and protecting mitochondria, followed by NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results will provide the prevention and treatment of ethanol intake effects with new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oxypeucedanin relieves LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the inflammation and maintaining the integrity of the lung air-blood barrier</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35985771/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is commonly accompanied by a severe inflammatory reaction process, and effectively managing inflammatory reactions is an important therapeutic approach for alleviating ALI. Macrophages play an important role in the inflammatory response, and this role is proinflammatory in the early stages of inflammation and anti-inflammatory in the late stages. Oxypeucedanin is a natural product with a wide range of pharmacological functions. This study aimed to determine the effect of oxypeucedanin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the following experiments were performed based on LPS-induced models &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Using myeloperoxidase activity measurement, ELISA, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting, we found that oxypeucedanin modulated the activity of myeloperoxidase and decreased the expression levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, MPO, COX-2 and iNOS in LPS-induced inflammation models. Meanwhile, oxypeucedanin inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT and its downstream NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, oxypeucedanin significantly decreased the pulmonary vascular permeability, which was induced by LPSs, and the enhanced expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin and Claudin 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of oxypeucedanin is associated with the inhibition of the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways and the maintenance of the integrity of the lung air-blood barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that poses a major challenge in critical care medicine. The development of ALI/ARDS involves excessive inflammatory response, and macrophage autophagy plays an important role in regulating the inflammatory response in ALI/ARDS. In this paper, we review the effects of autophagy in regulating macrophage function, discuss the roles of macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS, and highlight drugs and other interventions that can modulate macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS to improve the understanding of the mechanism of macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS and provide new ideas and further research directions for the treatment of ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We commenced to analyze putative anti-pyroptosis effects of puerarin (PU) as mediated by the PP2A-HDAC1-NLRP3 pathway in acute lung injury (ALI). ALI animal and cell models were constructed, followed by treatment of PU. Then, the effect of HDAC1, PP2A, and NLRP3 on cell inflammation and pyroptosis was explored. The interaction between HDAC1 and PP2A as well as between PP2A and NLRP3 was analyzed. Our findings suggested that PU downregulated HDAC1 expression to alleviate symptoms of ALI. HDAC1 overexpression promoted inflammation induced by LPS, which reversed the inhibitory effect of PU on ALI. HDAC1 overexpression also decreased PP2A expression, suggesting that PP2A was involved in the effects of HDAC1 on LPS-induced inflammation. PP2A exerted inhibitory effects on NLRP3. Meanwhile, PU hindered the progression of ALI by silencing HDAC1 or overexpressing PP2A both in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, PU restrained pyroptosis of cells induced by NLRP3 inflammasome to abate ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor Progression Locus 2 Protects against Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Influenza A Virus-Infected Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35980186/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation in patients with severe influenza disease may lead to acute lung injury that results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is associated with alveolar damage and pulmonary edema that severely impair gas exchange, leading to hypoxia. With no existing FDA-approved treatment for ARDS, it is important to understand the factors that lead to virus-induced ARDS development to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We have previously shown that mice deficient in the serine-threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase, Tpl2 (MAP3K8 or COT), succumb to infection with a typically low-pathogenicity strain of influenza A virus (IAV; HKX31, H3N2 [x31]). The goal of the current study was to evaluate influenza A virus-infected &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice clinically and histopathologically to gain insight into the disease mechanism. We hypothesized that &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice succumb to IAV infection due to development of ARDS-like disease and pulmonary dysfunction. We observed prominent signs of alveolar septal necrosis, hyaline membranes, pleuritis, edema, and higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the lungs of IAV-infected &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice from 7 to 9 days postinfection (dpi). Notably, WT mice showed signs of regenerating epithelium, indicative of repair and recovery, that were reduced in &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Furthermore, biomarkers associated with human ARDS cases were upregulated in &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice at 7 dpi, demonstrating an ARDS-like phenotype in &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice in response to IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the protective role of the serine-threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase, Tpl2, in influenza virus pathogenesis and reveals that host Tpl2 deficiency is sufficient to convert a low-pathogenicity influenza A virus infection into severe influenza disease that resembles ARDS, both histopathologically and transcriptionally. The IAV-infected &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mouse thereby represents a novel murine model for studying ARDS-like disease that could improve our understanding of this aggressive disease and assist in the design of better diagnostics and treatments.

      <title>Vitamin-D ameliorates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via augmenting miR-149-5p and downregulating ER stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35988833/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury is a life-threatening medical problem induced by sepsis or endotoxins and may be associated with enhanced Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Vitamin-D (Vit-D) possesses an anti-inflammatory effect; however, this specific mechanism on acute lung injury is still unknown. Here we scrutinize the mechanism of Vit-D on Acute lung injury (ALI) models and explored the Vit-D augmented miRNA&amp;rsquo;s role in regulating the ER stress pathway in ALI. Sepsis was induced by CLP, and Endotoxemia was caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that Vit-D alleviates pulmonary edema, improves lung histoarchitecture, infiltration of neutrophils, endothelial barrier in mice, and improves ER stress markers Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) and CHOP (C/EBP Homologous Protein) expression elevated by CLP/LPS induce ALI. Vit-D decreases the nitric oxide production and ATF6 in macrophages induced by LPS. Vit-D augments miR (miR-149-5p) in LPS-induce macrophages, CLP, and LPS-induced ALI models. Vit-D enhanced miRNA-149-5p when overexpressed, inhibited ER-specific ATF6 inflammatory pathway in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and improved histoarchitecture of the lung in LPS/CLP-induced mice models. This vitro and vivo studies demonstrate that Vit-D could improve ALI induced by CLP/LPS. In this regard, miR-149-5p may play a crucial role in vitamin-D inhibiting LPS/CLP induce ALI. The mechanism might be an association of increased miR-149-5p and its regulated gene target ATF6, and downstream CHOP proteins were suppressed. Thus, these findings demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory effect of Vit-D is achieved by augmentation of miRNA-149-5p expression, which may be a key physiologic mediator in the prevention and treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acadesine alleviates acute pancreatitis-related lung injury by mediating the barrier protective function of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35987144/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretreatment with acadesine shows therapeutic potential SAP-ALI in vivo and vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endothelial injury is critical for the initiation and progression of severe acute pancreatitis-related acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The beneficial effects of acadesine may involve reducing ROS accumulation and inhibiting apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acadesine inhibits the impairment of SAP-ALI by activating the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a condition characterized by highly fatal acute inflammation and is usually associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Acute lung injury (ALI) is the most common complications of SAP, which is the accelerator of other organ dysfunction caused by SAP and the primary cause of early death due to SAP. Acadesine, an adenosine analog and an AMPK activator, has been discovered to modulate glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS. However, its role in SAP-ALI and its mechanism remains unclear and need to be explored. Herein, we discovered that acadesine mitigated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), alleviated apoptosis and recovered barrier integrity, thereby contributing to anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Nrf2 deficiency partially eliminated the effects of acadesine-induced antioxidant effects and thus weakened the protective effects on cells and Nrf2-knockout (Nrf2&lt;Sup&gt;-/-&lt;/Sup&gt;) mice. This study demonstrates that acadesine attenuated SAP-ALI associated inflammation and tissue damage by modulating the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway by triggering AMPK. These findings are of great significance for the treatment of SAP-related lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion improves LPS-induced acute lung injury via gut-lung axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35981631/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute inflammatory disorder. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathology of ALI remain elusive. An increasing evidence suggests the role of the gut-microbiota axis in the pathology of lung injury. This study aimed to investigate whether antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion could affect ALI in mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; The effects of antibiotic cocktail (ABX) on ALI in the mice after intratracheally administration of LPS (5 mg/kg) were examined. Furthermore, 16s rRNA analysis and measurement of short-chain fatty acids in feces samples and metabolomics analysis of blood samples were performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; LPS significantly increased the interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of water-treated mice. Interestingly, an ABX significantly attenuated the LPS-induced increase in IL-6 in BALF and lung injury scores. Furthermore, ABX and/or LPS treatment markedly altered the α- and β-diversity of the gut microbiota. There were significant differences in the α- and β-diversity of the water + LPS group and ABX + LPS group. LEfSe analysis identified &lt;em&gt;Enterococusfaecalis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Clostriumtertium&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroidescaecimyris&lt;/em&gt; as potential microbial markers for ABX + LPS group. Untargeted metabolomics analysis identified several plasma metabolites responsible for discriminating water + LPS group from ABX + LPS group. There were correlations between the relative abundance of the microbiome and plasma metabolites. Integrative network analysis showed correlations between IL-6 levels in BALF and several gut microbes (or plasma metabolites).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; These data suggest that ABX-induced microbiome depletion could protect against LPS-induced ALI via the gut-microbiota-lung axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>miR-141 exacerbates lung ischemia-reperfusion injury by targeting EGFR/β-catenin axis-mediated autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35972910/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) injury. Here, this study aimed to examine whether miR-141 was related to lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) via regulating autophagy and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and to explore the underlying signal transduction pathways. To this end, we constructed the LIRI cell model and mouse models, separately. According to RT-qPCR and Western blotting (WB) analysis results, miR-141 up-regulation together with β-catenin and EGFR down-regulation within mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) or lung tissues was related to lung IRI. Besides, we conducted dual-luciferase reporter assay, which suggested the binding of EGFR to miR-141. In addition, we carried out TUNEL staining, HE staining, and flow cytometric analysis to assess the apoptosis of PMVECs and the injury to mouse lung tissues. Furthermore, we performed light-chain immunofluorescence assay to examine autophagosomes within PMVECs. According to our results, miR-141 suppressed β-catenin level through reducing EGFR level. Besides, the miR-141/EGFR/β-catenin axis enhanced autophagy to aggravate LIRI. To sum up, miR-141 suppresses EGFR expression to inhibit β-catenin level, which subsequently aggravates autophagy and complicates LIRI. The above results offer the candidate therapeutic target for the treatment of lung IRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protection against influenza-induced Acute Lung Injury (ALI) by enhanced induction of M2a macrophages: possible role of PPARγ/RXR ligands in IL-4-induced M2a macrophage differentiation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36052067/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many respiratory viruses cause lung damage that may evolve into acute lung injury (ALI), a cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and ultimately, death. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) family of transcription factors, regulates transcription by forming heterodimers with another NHR family member, Retinoid X Receptor (RXR). Each component of the heterodimer binds specific ligands that modify transcriptional capacity of the entire heterodimer by recruiting different co-activators/co-repressors. However, the role of PPARγ/RXR ligands in the context of influenza infection is not well understood. PPARγ is associated with macrophage differentiation to an anti-inflammatory M2 state. We show that mice lacking the IL-4Rα receptor, required for M2a macrophage differentiation, are more susceptible to mouse-adapted influenza (A/PR/8/34; &amp;ldquo;PR8&amp;rdquo;)-induced lethality. Mice lacking &lt;em&gt;Ptgs2&lt;/em&gt;, that encodes COX-2, a key proinflammatory M1 macrophage mediator, are more resistant. Blocking the receptor for COX-2-induced Prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was also protective. Treatment with pioglitazone (PGZ), a PPARγ ligand, increased survival from PR8 infection, decreased M1 macrophage gene expression, and increased PPARγ mRNA in lungs. Conversely, conditional knockout mice expressing PPARγ-deficient macrophages were significantly more sensitive to PR8-induced lethality. These findings were extended in cotton rats: PGZ blunted lung inflammation and M1 cytokine gene expression after challenge with non-adapted human influenza. To study mechanisms by which PPARγ/RXR transcription factors induce canonical M2a genes, WT mouse macrophages were treated with IL-4 in the absence or presence of rosiglitazone (RGZ; PPARγ ligand), LG100754 (LG; RXR ligand), or both. IL-4 dose-dependently induced M2a genes &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chil3&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Retnla&lt;/em&gt;. Treatment of macrophages with IL-4 and RGZ and/or LG differentially affected induction of &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;Chil3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Retnla&lt;/em&gt; gene expression. In PPARγ-deficient macrophages, IL-4 alone failed to induce &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; gene expression; however, concurrent treatment with LG or RGZ + LG enhanced IL-4-induced &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; expression, but to a lower level than in WT macrophages, findings confirmed in the murine alveolar macrophage cell line, MH-S. These findings support a model in which PPARγ/RXR heterodimers control IL-4-induced M2a differentiation, and suggest that PPARγ/RXR agonists should be considered as important tools for clinical intervention against influenza-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Qinbaohong Zhike Oral Liquid Attenuates LPS-Induced Acute Lung Injury in Immature Rats by Inhibiting OLFM4</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36035204/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a common public safety threat with high morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients worldwide. Qinbaohong Zhike oral liquid (QBH), a marketed traditional Chinese medicine product, has been widely used to cure respiratory diseases. QBH is reported to have antitussive, expectorant, and antiasthmatic properties. However, its treatment effect against ARIs is not elucidated. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic efficacy of QBH in the treatment of ARIs-induced pneumonia. Network pharmacology was used to predict the possible targets of QBH against ARIs. Next, the tracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS-)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) immature rat model was constructed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of QBH. Tandem mass tag (TMT-)-based quantitative proteomics was then used to screen the in-depth disease targets of QBH. QBH exerted a protective effect against LPS-induced ALI by inhibiting pulmonary pathological damage. QBH also reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the serum and IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF in the lung tissue. Based on proteomic data, olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) related to immunity and inflammation was selected as a potential target. Western blot analysis further confirmed the moderating effect of QBH downregulation on OLFM4 in the lung tissue. Our findings demonstrated that QBH alleviated lung tissue damage and inflammatory reaction via inhibiting OLFM4 expression in LPS-challenged immature rats. Our research indicates that QBH may have therapeutic potential for treating ARIs-related ALI in pediatric patients, which also serves as a candidate target for drug therapy of ALI by intervening OLFM-related signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanisms of pulmonary endothelial permeability and inflammation caused by extracellular histone subunits H3 and H4</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35969180/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular DNA-binding proteins such as histones are danger-associated molecular pattern released by the injured tissues in trauma and sepsis settings, which trigger host immune response and vascular dysfunction. Molecular events leading to histone-induced endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction remain poorly understood. This study performed comparative analysis of H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histone subunits effects on human pulmonary EC permeability and inflammatory response. Analysis of transendothelial electrical resistance and EC monolayer permeability for macromolecues revealed that H3 and H4, but not H1, H2A, or H2B caused dose-dependent EC permeability accompanied by disassembly of adherens junctions. At higher doses, H3 and H4 activated nuclear factor kappa B inflammatory cascade leading to upregulation EC adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1, E-selectin, and release of inflammatory cytokines. Inhibitory receptor analysis showed that toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 but not TLR1/2 or receptor for advanced glycation end inhibition significantly attenuated deleterious effects of H3 and H4 histones. Inhibitor of Rho-kinase was without effect, while inhibition of Src kinase caused partial preservation of cell-cell junctions, H3/H4-induced permeability and inflammation. Deleterious effects of H3/H4 were blocked by heparin. Activation of Epac-Rap1 signaling restored EC barrier properties after histone challenge. Intravenous injection of histones in mice caused elevation of inflammatory markers and increased vascular leak. Post-treatment with pharmacological Epac/Rap1 activator suppressed injurious effects of histones in vitro and in vivo. These results identify H3 and H4 as key histone subunits exhibiting deleterious effects on pulmonary vascular endothelium via TLR4-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, elevation of circulating histones may represent a serious risk of exacerbated acute lung injury (ALI) and multiple organ injury during severe trauma and infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macrophage SAMSN1 protects against sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35981417/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the progression of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). SAM domain, SH3 domain and nuclear localization signals 1 (SAMSN1) is a signaling adaptor protein, and mainly regulates inflammatory response of various immune cells. The present study generates macrophage-specific SAMSN1-knockout (Samsn1MKO) and SAMSN1-transgenic (Samsn1MTG) mice to investigate its role and mechanism in sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Samsn1&lt;sup&gt;MKO&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Samsn1&lt;sup&gt;MTG&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instillation or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery to induce sepsis-induced ALI. Bone marrow transplantation, cellular depletion and non-invasive adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were performed to validate the role of macrophage SAMSN1 in sepsis-induced ALI in vivo. Meanwhile, BMDMs were isolated from Samsn1MKO or Samsn1MTG mice to further clarify the role of SAMSN1 in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Macrophage SAMSN1 expression was increased in response to LPS stimulation, and negatively correlated with LPS-induced ALI in mice. Macrophage SAMSN1 deficiency exacerbated, while macrophage SAMSN1 overexpression ameliorated LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and ALI in mice and in BMDMs. Mechanistically, we found that macrophage SAMSN1 overexpression prevented LPS-induced ALI though activating AMP-activated protein kinase α2 (AMPKα2) &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Further studies revealed that SAMSN1 directly bound to growth factor receptor bound protein 2-associated protein 1 (GAB1) to prevent its protein degradation, and subsequently enhanced protein kinase A (PKA)/AMPKα2 activation in a protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11, also known as SHP2)-dependent manner. Moreover, we observed that macrophage SAMSN1 overexpression diminished CLP-induced ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study documents the protective role of macrophage SAMSN1 against sepsis-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and ALI through activating AMPKα2 in a GAB1/SHP2/PKA pathway, and defines it as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target to treat sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upregulating carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 attenuates hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and persistent lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35964084/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease in premature infants that may cause long-term lung dysfunction. Accumulating evidence supports the vascular hypothesis of BPD, in which lung endothelial cell dysfunction drives this disease. We recently reported that endothelial carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a) is reduced by hyperoxia, and that endothelial cell-specific Cpt1a knockout mice are more susceptible to developing hyperoxia-induced injury than wild type mice. Whether Cpt1a upregulation attenuates hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and lung injury remains unknown. We hypothesized that upregulation of Cpt1a by baicalin or L-carnitine ameliorates hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and persistent lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Lung endothelial cells or newborn mice (&amp;lt; 12 h old) were treated with baicalin or L-carnitine after hyperoxia (50% and 95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) followed by air recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that incubation with L-carnitine (40 and 80 mg/L) and baicalin (22.5 and 45 mg/L) reduced hyperoxia-induced apoptosis, impaired cell migration and angiogenesis in cultured lung endothelial cells. This was associated with increased Cpt1a gene expression. In mice, neonatal hyperoxia caused persistent alveolar and vascular simplification in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with L-carnitine (150 and 300 mg/kg) and baicalin (50 and 100 mg/kg) attenuated neonatal hyperoxia-induced alveolar and vascular simplification in adult mice. These effects were diminished in endothelial cell-specific Cpt1a knockout mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Upregulating Cpt1a by baicalin or L-carnitine ameliorates hyperoxia-induced lung endothelial cell dysfunction, and persistent alveolar and vascular simplification. These findings provide potential therapeutic avenues for using L-carnitine and baicalin as Cpt1a upregulators to prevent persistent lung injury in premature infants with BPD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zanubrutinib ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via regulating macrophage polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35973369/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35973369/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zanubrutinib could relieve LPS induced lung injuries in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway is involved in Zanubrutinib -mediated M1 macrophage polarization in RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zanubrutinib promotes M2 macrophage activation through regulating JAK/STAT6 and PI3K/AKT pathway in RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a disease characterized by pulmonary diffusion dysfunction and its exacerbation stage is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may develop to multiple organ failure and seriously threatens human health. ALI has high mortality rates and few effective treatments, thus effective protection measures for ALI are becoming increasingly important. Macrophages play a key regulatory role in the pathogenesis of ALI, and the degree of macrophage polarization is closely related to the severity and prognosis of ALI. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Zanubrutinib (ZB), a BTK small molecule inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of cell lymphoma, on macrophage polarization and acute lung injury. In the in vivo study, we constructed a mouse model of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury and found that ZB could improve the acute injury of mouse lungs by inhibiting the secretion of proinflammatory factors and promoting the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, reduce the number of inflammatory cells in alveolar lavage fluid, and then alleviate the inflammatory response. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that ZB could inhibit the M1 macrophage polarization and promote the M2 macrophage polarization. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that ZB could inhibit the macrophage M1 polarization via targeting BTK activation and inhibiting JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways, and promote the macrophage M2 polarization by promoting the activation of STAT6 and PI3K / Akt signaling pathways. In summary, ZB has shown therapeutic effect in LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, which provides a potential candidate drug to treat acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of the key ferroptosis-related genes involved in sepsis progression and experimental validation in vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36188533/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36188533/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ferroptosis has a vital role in sepsis, but the mechanism is not known. Understanding the mechanism of ferroptosis during sepsis will aid in developing improved therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used the Gene Expression Omnibus database and FerrDb database to obtain ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between sepsis patients and healthy volunteers (HVs). Analyses of PPI networks, functional enrichment, as well as use of the MCODE algorithm were used to identify key ferroptosis-related DEGs. Expression of key ferroptosis-related DEGs was verified using: GSE57065 and GSE65682 datasets; rats in which ferroptosis was induced with erastin; sepsis-induced acute lung injury (siALI) rats. The effects of acupoint catgut embedding (ACE) on ferroptosis and expression of key ferroptosis-related DEGs in the lungs of siALI rats were also observed. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to verify the effect of key ferroptosis-related DEGs on the survival of sepsis patients. Cytoscape was used to construct ceRNA networks and gene-transcription factor networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Between sepsis patients and HVs, we identified 33 ferroptosis-related DEGs. According to analyses of PPI networks and the MCODE algorithm, we obtained four modules, of which the most significant module contained nine ferroptosis-related DEGs. Functional-enrichment analyses showed that four of the nine DEGs were enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway: &lt;em&gt;MAPK14&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;VEGFA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TGFBR1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DUSP1&lt;/em&gt;. We verified expression of these four genes in GSE57065 and GSE65682 datasets and ferroptosis rats. In addition, expression of these four genes and that of the oxidative-stress indicators GSSG and MDA was upregulated, and glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4) expression was downregulated, in siALI rats, but ACE reversed these changes. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that survival of sepsis patients in the high-risk group was shorter than that in the low-risk group. We found that the XIST-hsa-let-7b-5p-TGFBR1/DUSP1 ceRNA network and transcription factor E2F1 may be important regulators of these four DEGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results suggest that &lt;em&gt;MAPK14&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;VEGFA,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;TGFBR1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DUSP1&lt;/em&gt; may be key regulatory targets of ferroptosis in sepsis, and that ACE pretreatment may be antioxidant treatment for sepsis and alleviate ferroptosis. These findings provide a basis for further ferroptosis-related study in sepsis and provide new targets for its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Repair effect of photobiomodulation combined with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells on rats with acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36029758/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) impaired the function of blood oxygen exchange function, resulting in tissue hypoxia and patient death. Recently, human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) are thought to mitigate the effects of ALI, which boosts researchers&amp;rsquo; interest in employing stem cell-based therapies to manage ALI. However, as a novel therapy, hUCMSCs still face various limitations such as migrating weakly and insufficient proliferation in vivo. Photobiomodulation (PBM) effciently promotes cell proliferation, migration and homing, which presents a promising strategy for overcoming above limitations. In this study, PBM was emerged to intervene hUCMSCs through detecting cell proliferation, oxidative stress-related factors and inflammatory factors. These results assuredly confirmed that PBM enhanced the antioxidant capacity of cells and improved cell survival in vitro experiments. In vivo, PBM-intervened hUCMSCs intuitively reduce thickness of alveolar septum, excessive secretion of inflammatory factors, relieves bleeding, edema and fibrosis. As a physical intervention, PBM further strengthens the therapeutic effect of hUCMSCs and depicted a hopeful therapy in ALI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antioxidant Biodegradable Covalent Cyclodextrin Frameworks as Particulate Carriers for Inhalation Therapy against Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35948492/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug therapies for acute lung injury (ALI) are far from satisfactory, primarily because drugs cannot specifically target the lungs. Direct delivery of drugs to the deep alveolar regions by inhalation administration is crucial for the treatment of ALI. However, conventional inhalable carriers such as lactose and mannitol are generally inactive. Therefore, the use of a novel pharmacologically active carrier for pulmonary delivery may produce synergetic effects in treating ALI. Considering the pathophysiological environment of ALI, which typically featured excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acute inflammation, we synthesized a novel kind of biodegradable and ROS-sensitive cross-linked covalent cyclodextrin frameworks (OC-COF) with uniform inhalable particle size to treat ALI. OC-COF was devised to incorporate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-scavenging peroxalate ester linkages, which could hydrolyze and eliminate ROS generated in inflammatory sites. Ligustrazine (LIG), an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory natural compound, was loaded into OC-COF and evaluated as a dry powder inhaler (LIG@OC-COF) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, showing favorable aerodynamic properties and prominent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities for the synergistic effects of OC-COF and LIG. In ALI rats, inhalation of LIG@OC-COF with a one-fifth LIG dose significantly alleviated the inflammation, oxidant stress, and lung damage. Western blot analysis demonstrated that LIG@OC-COF protected the lungs by regulating the Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway. In summary, this study provides a novel ROS-responsive material as an inhalable particulate carrier for the improved treatment of ALI and other medical conditions.reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autoinducer-2 promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36033859/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that causes various acute and chronic lung infections in immunocompromised patients. We previously found that a quorum sensing (QS) signal, namely, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), facilitates the pathogenicity of the wild-type (WT) &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 strain &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. However, the immunological mechanism that leads to pulmonary injury remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of AI-2 on interleukin-17A (IL-17A) production during acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 lung infection using a mouse model, with an emphasis on the underlying immunological mechanism. Compared to infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 alone, infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 combined with AI-2 treatment resulted in significantly increased levels of IL-17A, numbers of Th17 cells and levels of STAT3 in the lung tissues of WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), as well as more serious lung damage. In contrast, the concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and the chemokine keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) were significantly reduced during &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infection in IL-17A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and no effects were observed after AI-2 treatment (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the level of IL-17A in the lungs of WT mice was significantly reduced following infection with a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; strain harboring mutations in the QS genes &lt;em&gt;lasR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rhlR&lt;/em&gt; compared with the level of IL-17A following infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1. Our data suggest that AI-2 promotes &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway by interfering with the QS systems of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. IL-17A may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infections in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal stromal cells-derived extracellular vesicles reprogramme macrophages in ARDS models through the miR-181a-5p-PTEN-pSTAT5-SOCS1 axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35948417/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; A better understanding of the mechanism of action of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) is needed to support their use as novel therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Macrophages are important mediators of ARDS inflammatory response. Suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins are key regulators of the macrophage phenotype switch. We therefore investigated whether SOCS proteins are involved in mediation of the MSC effect on human macrophage reprogramming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or plasma samples from patients with ARDS (these samples were previously classified into hypo-inflammatory and hyper-inflammatory phenotype) and treated with MSC conditioned medium (CM) or EVs. Protein expression was measured by Western blot. EV micro RNA (miRNA) content was determined by miRNA sequencing. In vivo: LPS-injured C57BL/6 mice were given EVs isolated from MSCs in which miR-181a had been silenced by miRNA inhibitor or overexpressed using miRNA mimic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; EVs were the key component of MSC CM responsible for anti-inflammatory modulation of human macrophages. EVs significantly reduced secretion of tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-8 by LPS-stimulated or ARDS plasma-stimulated MDMs and this was dependent on SOCS1. Transfer of miR-181a in EVs downregulated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and subsequently activated phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5) leading to upregulation of SOCS1 in macrophages. In vivo, EVs alleviated lung injury and upregulated pSTAT5 and SOCS1 expression in alveolar macrophages in a miR181-dependent manner. Overexpression of miR-181a in MSCs significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy of EVs in this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; miR-181a-PTEN-pSTAT5-SOCS1 axis is a novel pathway responsible for immunomodulatory effect of MSC EVs in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oridonin attenuates lung inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis via covalent targeting iNOS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oridonin alleviates the progression of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oridonin inhibits silica-induced alveolar macrophage injury and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oridonin covalently targets iNOS and inhibits its level and activity, thereby providing a new potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of silicosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicosis, the most common type of pneumoconiosis, exhibits a high incidence in workers who are chronically exposed to crystalline silica (CS). No specific remedy for cure as yet. The terpenoid oridonin exerts multiple modulatory functions in neoplasms and inflammations as a natural compound. In this study, we explored the effect of oridonin on silicosis and revealed the underlying molecular mechanism. An experimental silicosis mouse model was established to evaluate the effects of oridonin on pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, the impact of oridonin on alveolar macrophages (AMs) was examined in the MH-S cell line. Its molecular target, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), was identified by chemobiological means, and virus-mediated gene overexpression systems confirmed that oridonin directly restrained iNOS protein levels. Oridonin alleviated pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis in silicosis mice with no obvious systemic toxicity. These effects were partially related to oridonin inhibition of CS-induced AMs injury and inflammation. Furthermore, oridonin suppressed iNOS enzymatic expression and activity by covalently binding to the Thr109 residue of the iNOS target. Thus, our results indicate oridonin as a potential iNOS enzymatic suppressor in experimental silicosis that attenuates pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis progression, which provides a therapeutic avenue for silicosis prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salvianolactone acid A isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice by regulating PPAR-γ</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35985183/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Severe inflammation of the lungs results from acute lung injury (ALI), a common life-threatening lung disease with a high mortality rate. The ligand-activated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ plays essential roles in diverse biological processes including inflammation, metabolism, development, and immune response. Salvianolactone acid A (SA) is a terpenoid derived from the herb Salvia miltiorrhiza. However, there is a scarcity of experimental evidence indicating whether the effect of SA on ALI occurs via PPAR-γ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; SA (20 or 40 mg/kg, i.g., 1 time/day) was administered to mice for 3 d, followed by the induction of ALI by intranasal lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg). The lung function and levels of inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), immune cells, apoptosis, and PPAR-γ were examined. The antagonistic activity of GW9662 (GW, 1 µM, specific PPAR-γ blocker) and PPAR-γ transfection silencing against SA (10 μM) in BEAS-2B cells induced by LPS (10 μg/ml, 24 h) was also investigated to assess whether the observed effects caused by SA were mediated by PPAR-γ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that lung histopathological injury, the B-line, the fluorescence intensity of live small animal, and the biomarkers in BALF or lung in the treatment of SA could regulate significantly. In addition, SA obviously decreased the levels of ROS and apoptosis in the primary lung cells, and MDA, increased the levels of GSH-Px and SOD. SA reduced levels of macrophages and neutrophils. Furthermore, SA reduced the protein levels of Keap-1, Cleaved-caspase-3, Cleaved-caspase-9, p-p65/p65, NLRP3, IL-1β, and upregulated the levels of p-Nrf2/Nrf2, HO-1, Bcl-2/Bax, PPAR-γ, p-AMPK/AMPK in lung tissue. In addition, silencing and inhibition of PPAR-γ effectively decreased the protective effects of SA in BEAS-2B cells induced by LPS, which might indicate that the active molecules of SA regulate ALI via mediation by PPAR-γ, which exhibited that the effect of SA related to PPAR-γ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The anti-ALI effects of SA were partially mediated through PPAR-γ signaling. These data provide the molecular justification for the usage of SA in treating ALI and can assist in increasing the comprehensive utilization rate of Salvia miltiorrhiza.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advances in the use of exosomes for the treatment of ALI/ARDS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36016948/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality. Currently, the primary treatment for ALI/ARDS is mainly symptomatic therapy such as mechanical ventilation and fluid management. Due to the lack of effective treatment strategies, most ALI/ARDS patients face a poor prognosis. The discovery of exosomes has created a promising prospect for the treatment of ALI/ARDS. Exosomes can exert anti-inflammatory effects, inhibit apoptosis, and promote cell regeneration. The microRNA contained in exosomes can participate in intercellular communication and play an immunomodulatory role in ALI/ARDS disease models. This review discusses the possible mechanisms of exosomes in ALI/ARDS to facilitate the development of innovative treatments for ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Erythropoietin mediates re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages through PI3K/AKT signaling and protects mice against secondary infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016936/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure leads to a hypo-responsive state by macrophages to a secondary stimulation of LPS, known as endotoxin tolerance. However, recent findings show that functions of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages are not completely suppressed, whereas they undergo a functional re-programming process with upregulation of a panel of molecules leading to enhanced protective functions including antimicrobial and tissue-remodeling activities. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), exerts anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective activities. Nevertheless, the potential effects of EPO on functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages have not been investigated yet. Here, we found that initial LPS exposure led to upregulation of HIF-1α/EPO in macrophages and that EPO enhanced tolerance in tolerized macrophages and mice as demonstrated by suppressed proinflammatory genes such as &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; after secondary LPS stimulation. Moreover, we showed that EPO improved host protective genes in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages and mice, such as the anti-bacterial genes coding for cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (&lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;) and macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (&lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;), and the tissue-repairing gene vascular endothelial growth factor C (&lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;). Therefore, our findings indicate that EPO mediates the functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages. Mechanistically, we found that PI3K/AKT signaling contributed to EPO-mediated re-programming through upregulation of &lt;em&gt;Irak3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wdr5&lt;/em&gt; expression. Specifically, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK3) was responsible for inhibiting proinflammatory genes &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; in tolerized macrophages after LPS rechallenge, whereas WDR5 contributed to the upregulation of host beneficial genes including &lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;. In a septic model of mice, EPO pretreatment significantly promoted endotoxin-tolerant re-programming, alleviated lung injury, enhanced bacterial clearance, and decreased mortality in LPS-tolerized mice after secondary infection of &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;. Collectively, our results reveal a novel role for EPO in mediating functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages; thus, targeting EPO appears to be a new therapeutic option in sepsis and other inflammatory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histopathological, physiological and biochemical assessment of resveratrol nanocapsules efficacy in bleomycin-induced acute and chronic lung injury in rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35945895/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening illness which may progress to chronic pulmonary fibrosis (CPF). Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenol, is known to exert several pharmacological effects on lung injury. However, its physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic profile limit its clinical applications. In this study, RSV was loaded into lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) aiming to overcome these limitations. RSV-LNCs were prepared by phase inversion method and showed small uniform particle size (∼55 nm, PdI 0.04) with high entrapment efficiency &amp;gt;99%. The efficacy of RSV-LNCs in the prophylaxis against ALI and treatment of CPF was investigated in bleomycin-induced lung injury. For assessment of ALI, rats were administered a single oral dose of RSV (10 mg/kg) either free or as RSV-LNCs 4 h before bleomycin and euthanized 3 days later. For CPF, treatments in the same dose were given daily from days 10-20 after bleomycin and rats were euthanized on day-21. Results showed enhanced beneficial role for RSV-LNCs, compared to RSV, in the prevention of ALI as demonstrated by preservation of pulmonary microscopic and ultrastructural architecture and improvement of pulmonary functions. Analysis of BALF revealed reduction in oxidative stress markers, IL-6 level, leukocytosis and neutrophilia. iNOS and c-caspase 3 immunohistochemical expression and CD68+ cells immunofluorescence were inhibited. However, RSV-LNCs failed to show any improvement in oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, apoptosis and collagen deposition in CPF. In conclusion, RSV-LNCs are promising nanoplatforms for mitigating ALI detrimental effects. Future research investigating higher doses and longer durations of treatment is recommended to evaluate RSV-LNCs anti-fibrotic potential in CPF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD-L1 maintains neutrophil extracellular traps release by inhibiting neutrophil autophagy in endotoxin-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016930/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is not only an important molecule in mediating tumor immune escape, but also regulates inflammation development. Here we showed that PD-L1 was upregulated on neutrophils in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Neutrophil specific knockout of PD-L1 reduced lung injury in ARDS model induced by intratracheal LPS injection. The level of NET release was reduced and autophagy is elevated by PD-L1 knockout in ARDS neutrophils both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Inhibition of autophagy could reverse the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 knockout on NET release. PD-L1 interacted with p85 subunit of PI3K at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in neutrophils from ARDS patients, activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. An extrinsic neutralizing antibody against PD-L1 showed a protective effect against ARDS. Together, PD-L1 maintains the release of NETs by regulating autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in ARDS. Anti-PD-L1 therapy may be a promising measure in treating ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Allyl methyl trisulfide protected against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice via inhibition of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36003507/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allyl methyl trisulfide (AMTS) is one major lipid-soluble organosulfur compound of garlic. Previous studies have reported the potential therapeutic effect of garlic on acute lung injury (ALI) or its severe condition acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the specific substances that exert the regulatory effects are still unclear. In this study, we investigate the protective effects of AMTS on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice and explored the underlying mechanisms. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments, ICR mice were pretreated with 25-100 mg/kg AMTS for 7 days and followed by intratracheal instillation of LPS (1.5 mg/kg). The results showed that AMTS significantly attenuated LPS-induced deterioration of lung pathology, demonstrated by ameliorative edema and protein leakage, and improved pulmonary histopathological morphology. Meanwhile, the expression of inflammatory mediators and the infiltration of inflammation-regulation cells induced by LPS were also inhibited. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments also revealed that AMTS could alleviate inflammation response and inhibit the exaggeration of macrophage M1 polarization in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, we identified that AMTS treatment could attenuate the LPS-induced elevation of protein expression of p-IκBα, nuclear NF-κB-p65, COX2, iNOS, p-P38, p-ERK1/2, and p-JNK. Collectively, these data suggest that AMTS could attenuate LPS-induced ALI and the molecular mechanisms should be related to the suppression of the NF-κB and MAPKs pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cangma Huadu granules attenuate H1N1 virus-induced severe lung injury correlated with repressed apoptosis and altered gut microbiome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36090063/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe influenza A virus infection leads to overwhelming inflammatory responses and cellular apoptosis, which causes lung injury and contributes to high mortality and morbidity. The gut microbiome altered in response to the infection might influence the disease progression and the treatment outcome. Cangma Huadu (CMHD) granules, an in-hospital preparation of traditional Chinese medicine, have been shown to be favorable in the clinical treatment of influenza. However, the effects and mechanisms of CMHD granules on severe influenza pneumonia and its mechanisms are not well-known. In this study, a lethal influenza A (H1N1) A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (PR8)-infected mice model was established, and the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) V3-V4 region sequencing of the intestinal microbiome was conducted. We revealed that the oral administration of CMHD granules protects mice against higher mortality, enhanced weight loss, overwhelmed interferon-γ concentration, lung viral titers, and severe lung pathological injury in PR8-infected mice. CMHD granules&amp;rsquo; administration downregulated the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and malondialdehyde, while it upregulated the levels of IL-10, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. Subsequently, it decreased the protein ratio of B-cell lymphoma-2/Bcl-2-associated X and the expression of cleaved caspase-3. The diversity and compositions of the gut microbes were altered profoundly after the administration of CMHD granules in PR8-infected mice. A higher abundance of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parasutterella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Faecalibaculum&lt;/em&gt; was observed in the CMHD group, and a higher abundance of &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/em&gt; was observed in the positive drug Ribavirin group. The linear discriminant analysis effect size also revealed a higher proportion of &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium_pseudolongum&lt;/em&gt; characterized in the CMHD group. These results demonstrated that CMHD granules are a promising strategy for managing severe influenza and attenuating severe lung damage via reducing viral titer, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress. The mechanisms are involved in repressed Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis and altered composition and diversity of the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Galectin-3 inhibitor GB0139 protects against acute lung injury by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment and activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36003515/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Galectin-3 (Gal-3) drives fibrosis during chronic lung injury, however, its role in acute lung injury (ALI) remains unknown. Effective pharmacological therapies available for ALI are limited; identifying novel concepts in treatment is essential. GB0139 is a Gal-3 inhibitor currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We investigate the role of Gal-3 in ALI and evaluate whether its inhibition with GB0139 offers a protective role. The effect of GB0139 on ALI was explored &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The pharmacokinetic profile of intra-tracheal (i.t.) GB0139 was investigated in C57BL/6 mice to support the daily dosing regimen. GB0139 (1-30 µg) was then assessed following acute i.t. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bleomycin administration. Histology, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALf) analysis, and flow cytometric analysis of lung digests and BALf were performed. The impact of GB0139 on cell activation and apoptosis was determined &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; using neutrophils and THP-1, A549 and Jurkat E6 cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; GB0139 decreased inflammation severity via a reduction in neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and neutrophil activation. GB0139 reduced LPS-mediated increases in interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, GB0139 inhibited Gal-3-induced neutrophil activation, monocyte IL-8 secretion, T cell apoptosis and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes encoding for IL-8, TNFα, IL-6 in alveolar epithelial cells in response to mechanical stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These data indicate that Gal-3 adopts a pro-inflammatory role following the early stages of lung injury and supports the development of GB0139, as a potential treatment approach in ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent evidence for toxic effects of NH3 exposure on lung injury: Protective effects of L-selenomethionine</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35999759/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ammonia is a typical air pollutant, which has a strong toxic effect on respiratory system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ammonia exposure causes lung damage by oxidative stress and energy metabolism disorder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROS-mediated excessive autophagy is important mechanisms of ammonia toxicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L-selenomethionine can mitigate the toxic effect of ammonia exposure on lungs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a common air pollutant, which poses a serious threat to farm animals. L-selenomethionine is organic selenium (Se), which can inhibit intracellular ROS generation, block ROS-dependent autophagy, promote mitochondrial energy metabolism, and enhance the body&amp;rsquo;s immunity. Lung, as an important organ of the respiratory system, is highly susceptible to the toxic effects of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. However, there were few studies on the mechanism of toxic effects of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on lung tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on the lungs in pigs and the alleviating effect of L-selenomethionine. Twenty-four Large White-Duroc-Min pigs were randomly assigned to 4 groups: control group, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group, Se group, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +Se group. The results showed that exposure to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; caused damage and inflammation in lung tissues and significantly increased blood NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; concentration. NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; induced changes of oxidative stress indexes (GSH, GSH-Px, SOD, MDA, Keap1, Nrf2, and HO-1) and expressions of energy metabolism related genes (HK1, HK2, PFK, PK, LDHA, and HIF-1α). Ultrastructure showed that mitochondrial damage and autophagosome increased significantly, and the expression levels of autophagy related genes (Beclin1, ATG5, ATG7, ATG10, and p62) changed. However, the addition of L-selenomethionine alleviated the above changes, but there was still a significant difference compared with the control group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). This finding can provide a new evidence for mitigation of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Total flavonoids of Inula japonica alleviated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting the sEH activity: Insights from lipid metabolomics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150346/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe respiratory disease characterized by diffuse lung interstitial and respiratory distress and pulmonary edema with a mortality rate of 35%-40%. Inula japonica Thunb., known as &amp;ldquo;Xuan Fu Hua&amp;rdquo; in Chinese, is a traditional Chinese medicine Inulae Flos to use for relieving cough, eliminating expectorant, and preventing bacterial infections in the clinic, and possesses an anti-pulmonary fibrosis effect. However, the effect and action mechanism of I. japonica on ALI is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanism of total flavonoids of I. japonica (TFIJ) in the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design and methods:&lt;/em&gt; A mouse ALI model was established through administration of LPS by the intratracheal instillation. Protective effects of TFIJ in the inflammation and oxidative stress were studied in LPS-induced ALI mice based on inflammatory and oxidative stress factors, including MDA, MPO, SOD, and TNF-α. Lipid metabolomics, bioinformatics, Western blot, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry were performed to reveal the potential mechanism of TFIJ in the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; TFIJ significantly alleviated the interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells and the collapse of the alveoli in LPS-induced ALI mice. Lipid metabolomics demonstrated that TFIJ could significantly affect the CYP2J/sEH-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism, such as 11,12-EET, 14,15-EET, 8,9-DHET, 11,12-DHET, and 14,15-DHET, revealing that sEH was the potential target of TFIJ, which was further supported by the recombinant sEH-mediated the substrate hydrolysis in vitro (IC50 = 1.18 μg/ml). Inhibition of sEH by TFIJ alleviated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress via the MAPK, NF-κB, and Nrf2 signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These results demonstrated that TFIJ could suppress the sEH activity to stabilize the level of EETs, allowing the alleviation of the pathological course of lung injury in LPS-treated mice, which suggested that TFIJ could serve as the potential agents in the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phosgene-Induced acute lung injury: Approaches for mechanism-based treatment strategies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35983054/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosgene (COCl2) gas is a chemical intermediate of high-volume production with numerous industrial applications worldwide. Due to its high toxicity, accidental exposure to phosgene leads to various chemical injuries, primarily resulting in chemical-induced lung injury due to inhalation. Initially, the illness is mild and presents as coughing, chest tightness, and wheezing; however, within a few hours, symptoms progress to chronic respiratory depression, refractory pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, which may contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even death in severe cases. Despite rapid advances in medicine, effective treatments for phosgene-inhaled poisoning are lacking. Elucidating the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of acute inhalation toxicity caused by phosgene is necessary for the development of appropriate therapeutics. In this review, we discuss extant literature on relevant mechanisms and therapeutic strategies to highlight novel ideas for the treatment of phosgene-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>YAP1 alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35979359/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a phospholipid peroxidation-mediated and iron-dependent cell death form, involved in sepsis-induced organ injury and other lung diseases. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a key regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, could target multiple ferroptosis regulators. Herein, this study aimed to explore the involvement of ferroptosis in the etiopathogenesis of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and demonstrate that YAP1 could disrupt ferritinophagy and moderate sepsis-induced ALI. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models were constructed in wild-type (WT) and pulmonary epithelium-conditional knockout (YAP1f/f) mice to induce ALI, while MLE-12 cells with or without YAP1 overexpression were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. In-vivo modes showed that YAP1 knockout aggravated CLP-induced ALI and also accelerated pulmonary ferroptosis, as presented by the downregulated expression of GPX4, FTH1, and SLC7A11, along with the upregulated expression of SFXN1 and NCOA4. Transcriptome research identified these key genes and ferroptosis pathways involved in sepsis-induced ALI. In-vitro modes consistently verified that YAP1 deficiency boosted the ferrous iron accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction in response to LPS. Furthermore, the co-IP assay revealed that YAP1 overexpression could prevent the degradation of ferritin to a mass of Fe2+ (ferritinophagy) via disrupting the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction, which blocked the transport of cytoplasmic Fe2+ into the mitochondria via the mitochondrial membrane protein (SFXN1), further reducing the generation of mitochondrial ROS. Therefore, these findings revealed that YAP1 could inhibit ferroptosis in a ferritinophagy-mediated manner, thus alleviating sepsis-induced ALI, which may provide a new approach to the therapeutic orientation for sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of neutrophil extracellular traps in acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35967320/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a heterogeneous inflammatory condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. Neutrophils play a key role in the development of different forms of ALI, and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is emerging as a common pathogenic mechanism. NETs are essential in controlling pathogens, and their defective release or increased degradation leads to a higher risk of infection. However, NETs also contain several pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic molecules than can exacerbate thromboinflammation and lung tissue injury. To reduce NET-mediated lung damage and inflammation, DNase is frequently used in preclinical models of ALI due to its capability of digesting NET DNA scaffold. Moreover, recent advances in neutrophil biology led to the development of selective NET inhibitors, which also appear to reduce ALI in experimental models. Here we provide an overview of the role of NETs in different forms of ALI discussing existing gaps in our knowledge and novel therapeutic approaches to modulate their impact on lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The EGFR/ErbB inhibitor neratinib modifies the neutrophil phosphoproteome and promotes apoptosis and clearance by airway macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35967296/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulated neutrophilic inflammation can be highly destructive in chronic inflammatory diseases due to prolonged neutrophil lifespan and continual release of histotoxic mediators in inflamed tissues. Therapeutic induction of neutrophil apoptosis, an immunologically silent form of cell death, may be beneficial in these diseases, provided that the apoptotic neutrophils are efficiently cleared from the tissue. Previous research in our group identified ErbB inhibitors as able to induce neutrophil apoptosis and reduce neutrophilic inflammation both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Here, we extend that work using a clinical ErbB inhibitor, neratinib, which has the potential to be repurposed in inflammatory diseases. We show that neratinib reduces neutrophilic migration o an inflammatory site in zebrafish larvae. Neratinib upregulates efferocytosis and reduces the number of persisting neutrophil corpses in mouse models of acute, but not chronic, lung injury, suggesting that the drug may have therapeutic benefits in acute inflammatory settings. Phosphoproteomic analysis of human neutrophils shows that neratinib modifies the phosphorylation of proteins regulating apoptosis, migration, and efferocytosis. This work identifies a potential mechanism for neratinib in treating acute lung inflammation by upregulating the clearance of dead neutrophils and, through examination of the neutrophil phosphoproteome, provides important insights into the mechanisms by which this may be occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Study on the Radiosensitivity of Radiation-Induced Lung Injury at the Acute Phase Based on Single-Cell Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35967301/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is the most common complication associated with chest tumors, such as lung and breast cancers, after radiotherapy; however, the pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing has laid the foundation for studying RILI at the cellular microenvironmental level. This study focused on changes during the acute pneumonitis stage of RILI at the cellular microenvironmental level and investigated the interactions between different cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; An acute RILI model in mice and a single-cell transcriptional library were established. Intercellular communication networks were constructed to study the heterogeneity and intercellular interactions among different cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A single-cell transcriptome map was established in a mouse model of acute lung injury. In total, 18,500 single-cell transcripts were generated, and 10 major cell types were identified. The heterogeneity and radiosensitivity of each cell type or subtype in the lung tissues during the acute stage were revealed. It was found that immune cells had higher radiosensitivity than stromal cells. Immune cells were highly heterogeneous in terms of radiosensitivity, while some immune cells had the characteristics of radiation resistance. Two groups of radiation-induced Cd8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Mki67&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and Cd4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cxcr6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; helper T cells were identified. The presence of these cells was verified using immunofluorescence. The ligand-receptor interactions were analyzed by constructing intercellular communication networks. These explained the origins of the cells and revealed that they had been recruited from endothelial cells to the inflammatory site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study revealed the heterogeneity of &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; radiosensitivity of different cell types in the lung at the initial stage post irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oral IRAK4 inhibitor BAY-1834845 prevents acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36076574/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRAK4 inhibition is a potentially feasible treatment for ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BAY-1834845 shows unexpectedly discrepant efficacy in vivo with PF-06650833.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BAY-1834845 inhibits natural immunity signaling stronger than dexamethasone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lethal clinical entity that has become an emergency event with the outbreak of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no well-proven pharmacotherapies except dexamethasone. This study is aimed to evaluate IRAK4 inhibitors as a potential treatment for ARDS-cytokine release syndrome (CRS). We applied two IRAK4 inhibitors, BAY-1834845 and PF-06650833 to an inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS mouse model with control of high dose dexamethasone (10 mg/kg). Unexpectedly, although both compounds had excellent IC50 on IRAK4 kinase activity, only BAY-1834845 but not PF-06650833 or high dose dexamethasone could significantly prevent lung injury according to a blinded pathology scoring. Further, only BAY-1834845 and BAY-1834845 combined with dexamethasone could effectively improve the injury score of pre-existed ARDS. Compared with PF-06650833 and high dose dexamethasone, BAY-1834845 remarkably decreased inflammatory cells infiltrating lung tissue and neutrophil count in BALF. BAY-1834845, DEX, and the combination of the two agents could decrease BALF total T cells, monocyte, and macrophages. In further cell type enrichment analysis based on lung tissue RNA-seq, both BAY-1834845 and dexamethasone decreased signatures of inflammatory cells and effector lymphocytes. Interestingly, unlike the dexamethasone group, BAY-1834845 largely preserved the signatures of naïve lymphocytes and stromal cells such as endothelial cells, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells. Differential gene enrichment suggested that BAY-1834845 downregulated genes more efficiently than dexamethasone, especially TNF, IL-17, interferon, and Toll-like receptor signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting ETosis by miR-155 inhibition mitigates mixed granulocytic asthmatic lung inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthma is phenotypically heterogeneous with several distinctive pathological mechanistic pathways. Previous studies indicate that neutrophilic asthma has a poor response to standard asthma treatments comprising inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, it is important to identify critical factors that contribute to increased numbers of neutrophils in asthma patients whose symptoms are poorly controlled by conventional therapy. Leukocytes release chromatin fibers, referred to as extracellular traps (ETs) consisting of double-stranded (ds) DNA, histones, and granule contents. Excessive components of ETs contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma; however, it is unclear how ETs drive asthma phenotypes and whether they could be a potential therapeutic target. We employed a mouse model of severe asthma that recapitulates the intricate immune responses of neutrophilic and eosinophilic airway inflammation identified in patients with severe asthma. We used both a pharmacologic approach using miR-155 inhibitor-laden exosomes and genetic approaches using miR-155 knockout mice. Our data show that ETs are present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with mild asthma subjected to experimental subsegmental bronchoprovocation to an allergen and a severe asthma mouse model, which resembles the complex immune responses identified in severe human asthma. Furthermore, we show that miR-155 contributes to the extracellular release of dsDNA, which exacerbates allergic lung inflammation, and the inhibition of miR-155 results in therapeutic benefit in severe asthma mice. Our findings show that targeting dsDNA release represents an attractive therapeutic target for mitigating neutrophilic asthma phenotype, which is clinically refractory to standard care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress play critical roles in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colchicine (COL) mitigates severe acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury (SAP-ALI) in rats model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colchicine limits inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress in SAP-ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress contribute to the development of severe acute pancreatitis-associated acute lung injury (SAP-ALI). Currently, there is no curative treatment for SAP-ALI in the clinic. This study investigated the potential therapeutic role and mechanisms of colchicine in a rat model of SAP-ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized and administrated intragastrically with vehicle saline or colchicine (0.5 mg/kg/day) for seven days, followed by injecting sodium taurocholate to induce SAP-ALI. Together with a healthy control group of rats, their pancreatic and lung tissues and plasma samples were collected for histology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with the sham controls, the SAP group of rats with vehicle saline treatment displayed severe damages, inflammation with many neutrophil and macrophage infiltrates in pancreatic and lung tissues, accompanied by elevated levels of plasma interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which were significantly mitigated in colchicine-treated SAP + COL group of rats. Furthermore, colchicine treatment significantly attenuated nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)-p65, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 4-Hydroxynonenal expression, ROS production and cell apoptosis by decreasing caspase-3 cleavage, Bax expression, but increasing Bcl-2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in pancreatic and lung tissues, relative to the SAP group of rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Colchicine treatment significantly mitigated the severity of SAP-ALI by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in rats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation promotes alveolar epithelial recovery by activating Hippo/YAP signaling after lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35973885/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The preferred configuration for bridging patients with respiratory failure while awaiting lung transplantation is venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO). However, the protective effect of VV ECMO on the lung, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the role of VV ECMO in preventing lung injury in vivo using a rat model. Additionally, the effects of Hippo/YAP signaling on alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2)-mediated alveolar epithelial recovery in VV ECMO rats were also investigated. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, RNA sequencing, lung injury, edema, and cytokine expression were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; VV ECMO significantly improved severe hypoxemia, reduced lung edema, and inflammatory response, and altered alveolar epithelial function, as indicated by reduced protein concentrations in BALF. This was associated with Hippo/YAP signaling activation, according to RNA sequencing analysis. Furthermore, we discovered that after VV ECMO, AT2 cells proliferated and differentiated, and this increase in AT2 cell activity was correlated to the increased nuclear expression of YAP, which is critical for alveolar epithelial recovery from lung injury. During VV ECMO, verteporfin-induced YAP inhibition and the loss of the oxygenator delayed lung alveolar epithelial recovery and led to a prolonged inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings suggest that VV ECMO protects against lung injury by activating the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. Strategies aimed at increasing YAP activity in AT2 cells could thus aid alveolar epithelial recovery, making VV ECMO easier for lung transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The human lung microbiome—A hidden link between microbes and human health and diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/imt2.33/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once thought to be sterile, the human lung is now well recognized to harbor a consortium of microorganisms collectively known as the lung microbiome. The lung microbiome is altered in an array of lung diseases, including chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and bronchiectasis, acute lung diseases caused by pneumonia, sepsis, and COVID-19, and other lung complications such as those related to lung transplantation, lung cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus. The effects of lung microbiome in modulating host immunity and inflammation in the lung and distal organs are being elucidated. However, the precise mechanism by which members of microbiota produce structural ligands that interact with host genes and pathways remains largely uncharacterized. Multiple unique challenges, both technically and biologically, exist in the field of lung microbiome, necessitating the development of tailored experimental and analytical approaches to overcome the bottlenecks. In this review, we first provide an overview of the principles and methodologies in studying the lung microbiome. We next review current knowledge of the roles of lung microbiome in human diseases, highlighting mechanistic insights. We finally discuss critical challenges in the field and share our thoughts on broad topics for future investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metabolomic fingerprinting of porcine lung tissue during pre-clinical prolonged ex vivo lung perfusion using in vivo SPME coupled with LC-HRMS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36105172/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In vivo SPME monitors metabolic changes in porcine lung during 19-h NEVLP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-site SPME for perfusate sampling monitors metabolite composition during NEVLP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPME-LC-HRMS permits identification of potential metabolic markers of lung function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stored perfusate provides less relevant metabolome information compared to on-site perfusate samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In vivo SPME of the lung provides more metabolomic information than perfusate sampling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normothermic ex vivo lung perfusion (NEVLP) has emerged as a modernized organ preservation technique that allows for detailed assessment of donor lung function prior to transplantation. The main goal of this study was to identify potential biomarkers of lung function and/or injury during a prolonged (19 h) NEVLP procedure using in vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technology followed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). The use of minimally invasive in vivo SPME fibers for repeated sampling of biological tissue permits the monitoring and evaluation of biochemical changes and alterations in the metabolomic profile of the lung. These in vivo SPME fibers were directly introduced into the lung and were also used to extract metabolites (on-site SPME) from fresh perfusate samples collected alongside lung samplings. A subsequent goal of the study was to assess the feasibility of SPME as an in vivo method in metabolomics studies, in comparison to the traditional in-lab metabolomics workflow. Several upregulated biochemical pathways involved in pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, as well as lipid metabolism, were observed during extended lung perfusion, especially between the 11th and 12th hours of the procedure, in both lung and perfusate samples. However, several unstable and/or short-lived metabolites, such as neuroprostanes, have been extracted from lung tissue in vivo using SPME fibers. On-site monitoring of the metabolomic profiles of both lung tissues through in vivo SPME and perfusate samples on site throughout the prolonged NEVLP procedure can be effectively performed using in vivo SPME technology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Few studies reported the therapeutic effect of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) in lung inflammatory diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory role and underlying molecular in cadmium-induced lung injury have been poorly understood, directly linked to chronic lung diseases (CLDs): chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer etc. Therefore, in this study we aim to investigate the therapeutic activities of water extract of KRG (KRG-WE) in mouse cadmium-induced lung injury model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Method:&lt;/em&gt; The anti-inflammatory roles and underlying mechanisms of KRG-WE were evaluated in vitro under cadmium-stimulated lung epithelial cells (A549) and HEK293T cell line and in vivo in cadmium-induced lung injury mouse model using semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), luciferase assay, immunoblotting, and FACS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; KRG-WE strongly ameliorated the symptoms of CdSO4-induced lung injury in mice according to total cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and severity scores as well as cytokine levels. KRG-WE significantly suppressed the upregulation of inflammatory signaling comprising mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and their upstream enzymes. In in vitro study, KRG-WE suppressed expression of interleukin (IL)-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and IL-8 while promoting recovery in CdSO4-treated A549 cells. Similarly, KRG-WE reduced phosphorylation of MAPK and c-Jun/c-Fos in cadmium-exposed A549 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; KRG-WE was found to attenuate symptoms of cadmium-induced lung injury and reduce the expression of inflammatory genes by suppression of MAPK/AP-1-mediated pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circadian clock is the biochemical oscillator with a near 24-h period that is responsible for generating the circadian rhythms in peripheral organs including the lung. Mounting evidence suggests that circadian clock disruption during chronic lung diseases plays an essential role in augmented oxidative stress, inflammatory response, metabolic imbalances, hypoxia/hyperoxia, mucus secretion, dysregulated autophagy, and alters pulmonary function. Here, we review circadian clock disruption and discuss candidate clock genes that are altered at the transcriptional or translational level in chronic pulmonary diseases. This review aims to provide the current knowledge and understanding of the circadian molecular clock disruption in chronic pulmonary diseases which will further advance the development of novel clock-based therapeutics in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KMT2C deficiency promotes small cell lung cancer metastasis through DNMT3A-mediated epigenetic reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35449309/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is notorious for its early and frequent metastases, which contribute to it as a recalcitrant malignancy. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying SCLC metastasis, we generated SCLC mouse models with orthotopically transplanted genome-edited lung organoids and performed multiomics analyses. We found that a deficiency of KMT2C, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase frequently mutated in extensive-stage SCLC, promoted multiple-organ metastases in mice. Metastatic and KMT2C-deficient SCLC displayed both histone and DNA hypomethylation. Mechanistically, KMT2C directly regulated the expression of DNMT3A, a de novo DNA methyltransferase, through histone methylation. Forced DNMT3A expression restrained metastasis of KMT2C-deficient SCLC through repressing metastasis-promoting MEIS/HOX genes. Further, S-(5′-adenosyl)-L-methionine, the common cofactor of histone and DNA methyltransferases, inhibited SCLC metastasis. Thus, our study revealed a concerted epigenetic reprogramming of KMT2C- and DNMT3A-mediated histone and DNA hypomethylation underlying SCLC metastasis, which suggested a potential epigenetic therapeutic vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tidal Volume-Dependent Activation of the Renin-Angiotensin System in Experimental Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35191411/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35191411/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Mechanical damage to the lungs is potentially aggravated by the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This article describes RAS activation profiles in VILI and discusses the effects of angiotensin (Ang) 1-7 supplementation or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril as protective strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design:&lt;/em&gt; Animal study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting:&lt;/em&gt; University research laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjects:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interventions:&lt;/em&gt; Anesthetized mice ( n = 12-18 per group) were mechanically ventilated with low tidal volume (LV T , 6 mL/kg), high tidal volume (HV T , 15 mL/kg), or very high tidal volume (VHV T , 30 mL/kg) for 4 hours, or killed after 3 minutes (sham). Additional VHV T groups received infusions of 60 μg/kg/hr Ang 1-7 or a single dose of 100 mg/kg captopril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and main results:&lt;/em&gt; VILI was characterized by increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of interleukin (IL)-6, keratinocyte-derived cytokine, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP2). The Ang metabolites in plasma measured with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry showed a strong activation of the classical (Ang I, Ang II) and alternative RAS (Ang 1-7, Ang 1-5), with highest concentrations found in the HV T group. Although the lung-tissue ACE messenger RNA expression was unchanged, its protein expression showed a dose-dependent increase under mechanical ventilation. The ACE2 messenger RNA expression decreased in all ventilated groups, whereas ACE2 protein levels remained unchanged. Both captopril and Ang 1-7 led to markedly increased Ang 1-7 plasma levels, decreased Ang II levels, and ACE activity (Ang II/Ang I ratio), and effectively prevented VILI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; VILI is accompanied by a strong activation of the RAS. Based on circulating Ang metabolite levels and tissue expression of RAS enzymes, classical ACE-dependent and alternative RAS cascades were activated in the HV T group, whereas classical RAS activation prevailed with VHV T ventilation. Ang 1-7 or captopril protected from VILI primarily by modifying the systemic RAS profile.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neuropilin-1 mediates lung tissue-specific control of ILC2 function in type 2 immunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are highly heterogeneous tissue-resident lymphocytes that regulate inflammation and tissue homeostasis in health and disease. However, how these cells integrate into the tissue microenvironment to perform tissue-specific functions is unclear. Here, we show neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), which is induced postnatally and sustained by lung-derived transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1), is a tissue-specific marker of lung ILC2s. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of Nrp1 suppresses IL-5 and IL-13 production by ILC2s and protects mice from the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, TGFβ1-Nrp1 signaling enhances ILC2 function and type 2 immunity by upregulating IL-33 receptor ST2 expression. These findings identify Nrp1 as a tissue-specific regulator of lung-resident ILC2s and highlight Nrp1 as a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coal dust exposure triggers heterogeneity of transcriptional profiles in mouse pneumoconiosis and Vitamin D remedies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35057792/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Coal dust particles (CDP), an inevitable by-product of coal mining for the environment, mainly causes coal workers&amp;rsquo; pneumoconiosis (CWP). Long-term exposure to coal dust leads to a complex alternation of biological processes during regeneration and repair in the healing lung. However, the cellular and complete molecular changes associated with pulmonary homeostasis caused by respiratory coal dust particles remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; This study mainly investigated the pulmonary toxicity of respirable-sized CDP in mice using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing. CDP (&amp;lt; 5 μm) collected from the coal mine was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Mass Spectrometer. In addition, western blotting, Elisa, QPCR was used to detect gene expression at mRNA or protein levels. Pathological analysis including HE staining, Masson staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to characterize the structure and functional alternation in the pneumoconiosis mouse and verify the reliability of single-cell sequencing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; SEM image and Mass Spectrometer analysis showed that coal dust particles generated during coal mine production have been crushed and screened with a diameter of less than 5 µm and contained less than 10% silica. Alveolar structure and pulmonary microenvironment were destroyed, inflammatory and death (apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis) pathways were activated, leading to pneumoconiosis in post 9 months coal dust stimulation. A distinct abnormally increased alveolar type 2 epithelial cell (AT2) were classified with a highly active state but reduced the antimicrobial-related protein expression of LYZ and Chia1 after CDP exposure. Beclin1, LC3B, LAMP2, TGF-ß, and MLPH were up-regulated induced by CDP, promoting autophagy and pulmonary fibrosis. A new subset of macrophages with M2-type polarization double expressed MLPH + /CD206 + was found in mice having pneumoconiosis but markedly decreased after the Vitamin D treatment. Activated MLPH + /CD206 + M2 macrophages secreted TGF-β1 and are sensitive to Vitamin D treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This is the first study to reconstruct the pathologic progression and transcriptome pattern of coal pneumoconiosis in mice. Coal dust had obvious toxic effects on lung epithelial cells and macrophages and eventually induced pulmonary fibrosis. CDP-induced M2-type macrophages could be inhibited by VD, which may be related to the alleviation of the pulmonary fibrosis process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RBMS1 regulates lung cancer ferroptosis through translational control of SLC7A11</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34609966/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent nonapoptotic cell death, is a highly regulated tumor suppressing process. However, functions and mechanisms of RNA-binding proteins in regulation of evasion of ferroptosis during lung cancer progression are still largely unknown. Here, we report that the RNA-binding protein RBMS1 participates in lung cancer development via mediating ferroptosis evasion. Through an shRNA-mediated systematic screen, we discovered that RBMS1 is a key ferroptosis regulator. Clinically, RBMS1 was elevated in lung cancer and its high expression was associated with reduced patient survival. Conversely, depletion of RBMS1 inhibited lung cancer progression both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, RBMS1 interacted with the translation initiation factor eIF3d directly to bridge the 3&amp;rsquo;- and 5&amp;rsquo;-UTR of SLC7A11. RBMS1 ablation inhibited the translation of SLC7A11, reduced SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake, and promoted ferroptosis. In a drug screen that targeted RBMS1, we further uncovered that nortriptyline hydrochloride decreased the level of RBMS1, thereby promoting ferroptosis. Importantly, RBMS1 depletion or inhibition by nortriptyline hydrochloride sensitized radioresistant lung cancer cells to radiotherapy. Our findings established RBMS1 as a translational regulator of ferroptosis and a prognostic factor with therapeutic potential and clinical value.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Highway to heal: Influence of altered extracellular matrix on infiltrating immune cells during acute and chronic lung diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36408219/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental insults including respiratory infections, in combination with genetic predisposition, may lead to lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung fibrosis, asthma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Common characteristics of these diseases are infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells and abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, leading to tissue damage and impairments in lung function. The ECM provides three-dimensional (3D) architectural support to the lung and crucial biochemical and biophysical cues to the cells, directing cellular processes. As immune cells travel to reach any site of injury, they encounter the composition and various mechanical features of the ECM. Emerging evidence demonstrates the crucial role played by the local environment in recruiting immune cells and their function in lung diseases. Moreover, recent developments in the field have elucidated considerable differences in responses of immune cells in two-dimensional versus 3D modeling systems. Examining the effect of individual parameters of the ECM to study their effect independently and collectively in a 3D microenvironment will help in better understanding disease pathobiology. In this article, we discuss the importance of investigating cellular migration and recent advances in this field. Moreover, we summarize changes in the ECM in lung diseases and the potential impacts on infiltrating immune cell migration in these diseases. There has been compelling progress in this field that encourages further developments, such as advanced in vitro 3D modeling using native ECM-based models, patient-derived materials, and bioprinting. We conclude with an overview of these state-of-the-art methodologies, followed by a discussion on developing novel and innovative models and the practical challenges envisaged in implementing and utilizing these systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cis-acting lnc-Cxcl2 restrains neutrophil-mediated lung inflammation by inhibiting epithelial cell CXCL2 expression in virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34607953/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemokine production by epithelial cells is important for neutrophil recruitment during viral infection, the appropriate regulation of which is critical for restraining inflammation and attenuating subsequent tissue damage. Epithelial cell expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), RNA-binding proteins, and their functional interactions during viral infection and inflammation remain to be fully understood. Here, we identified an inducible lncRNA in the &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; gene locus, lnc-Cxcl2, which could selectively inhibit &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; expression in mouse lung epithelial cells but not in macrophages. lnc-Cxcl2-deficient mice exhibited increased &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; expression, enhanced neutrophils recruitment, and more severe inflammation in the lung after influenza virus infection. Mechanistically, nucleus-localized lnc-Cxcl2 bound to &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; promoter, recruited a ribonucleoprotein La, which inhibited the chromatin accessibility of chemokine promoters, and consequently inhibited &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; transcription in cis However, unlike mouse lnc-Cxcl2, human lnc-CXCL2-4-1 inhibited multiple immune cytokine expressions including chemokines in human lung epithelial cells. Together, our results demonstrate a self-protecting mechanism within epithelial cells to restrain chemokine and neutrophil-mediated inflammation, providing clues for better understanding chemokine regulation and epithelial cell function in lung viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Biosafety Level 2 Mouse Model for Studying Betacoronavirus-Induced Acute Lung Damage and Systemic Manifestations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34495692/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of life-threatening zoonotic diseases caused by betacoronaviruses, including the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, has highlighted the need for developing preclinical models mirroring respiratory and systemic pathophysiological manifestations seen in infected humans. Here, we showed that C57BL/6J wild-type mice intranasally inoculated with the murine betacoronavirus murine hepatitis coronavirus 3 (MHV-3) develop a robust inflammatory response leading to acute lung injuries, including alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and fibrin thrombi. Although such histopathological changes seemed to resolve as the infection advanced, they efficiently impaired respiratory function, as the infected mice displayed restricted lung distention and increased respiratory frequency and ventilation. Following respiratory manifestation, the MHV-3 infection became systemic, and a high virus burden could be detected in multiple organs along with morphological changes. The systemic manifestation of MHV-3 infection was also marked by a sharp drop in the number of circulating platelets and lymphocytes, besides the augmented concentration of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-12, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), thereby mirroring some clinical features observed in moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. Importantly, both respiratory and systemic changes triggered by MHV-3 infection were greatly prevented by blocking TNF signaling, either via genetic or pharmacologic approaches. In line with this, TNF blockage also diminished the infection-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines and virus replication of human epithelial lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Collectively, results show that MHV-3 respiratory infection leads to a large range of clinical manifestations in mice and may constitute an attractive, lower-cost, biosafety level 2 (BSL2) in vivo platform for evaluating the respiratory and multiorgan involvement of betacoronavirus infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouse models have long been used as valuable in vivo platforms to investigate the pathogenesis of viral infections and effective countermeasures. The natural resistance of mice to the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has launched a race toward the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection in other animals (e.g., hamsters, cats, ferrets, bats, and monkeys), as well as adaptation of the mouse model, by modifying either the host or the virus. In the present study, we utilized a natural pathogen of mice, MHV, as a prototype to model betacoronavirus-induced acute lung injure and multiorgan involvement under biosafety level 2 conditions. We showed that C57BL/6J mice intranasally inoculated with MHV-3 develops severe disease, which includes acute lung damage and respiratory distress that precede systemic inflammation and death. Accordingly, the proposed animal model may provide a useful tool for studies regarding betacoronavirus respiratory infection and related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-1β augments TGF-β inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition of epithelial cells and associates with poor pulmonary function improvement in neutrophilic asthmatics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34344357/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophilic asthmatics (NA) have less response to inhaled corticosteroids. We aimed to find out the predictor of treatment response in NA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthmatics (n = 115) and healthy controls (n = 28) underwent clinical assessment during 6-month follow-up with standardized therapy. Asthmatics were categorized by sputum differential cell count. The mRNA expressions were measured by RT-qPCR for sputum cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-27, FOXP3, IL-17A, and IL-5). The protein of IL-1β in sputum supernatant was detected by ELISA. Reticular basement membranes (RBM) were measured in the biopsy samples. The role and signaling pathways of IL-1β mediating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process were explored through A549 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NA had increased baseline sputum cell IL-1β expression compared to eosinophilic asthmatics (EA). After follow-up, NA had less improvement in FEV1 compared to EA. For all asthmatics, sputum IL-1β mRNA was positively correlated with protein expression. Sputum IL-1β mRNA and protein levels were negatively correlated to FEV1 improvement. After subgrouping, the correlation between IL-1β mRNA and FEV1 improvement was significant in NA but not in EA. Thickness of RBM in asthmatics was greater than that of healthy controls and positively correlated with neutrophil percentage in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In vitro experiments, the process of IL-1β augmenting TGF-β1-induced EMT cannot be abrogated by glucocorticoid or montelukast sodium, but can be reversed by MAPK inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IL-1β level in baseline sputum predicts the poor lung function improvement in NA. The potential mechanism may be related to IL-1β augmenting TGF-β1-induced steroid-resistant EMT through MAPK signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammatory responses induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with severe symptoms of COVID-19. Inflammasomes activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are also associated with COVID-19 severity. Here, we show a distinct mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation to induce hyperinflammation. N protein facilitates maturation of proinflammatory cytokines and induces proinflammatory responses in cultured cells and mice. Mechanistically, N protein interacts directly with NLRP3 protein, promotes the binding of NLRP3 with ASC, and facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. More importantly, N protein aggravates lung injury, accelerates death in sepsis and acute inflammation mouse models, and promotes IL-1β and IL-6 activation in mice. Notably, N-induced lung injury and cytokine production are blocked by MCC950 (a specific inhibitor of NLRP3) and Ac-YVAD-cmk (an inhibitor of caspase-1). Therefore, this study reveals a distinct mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and induces excessive inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Age-dependent alveolar epithelial plasticity orchestrates lung homeostasis and regeneration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regeneration of the architecturally complex alveolar niche of the lung requires precise temporal and spatial control of epithelial cell behavior. Injury can lead to a permanent reduction in gas exchange surface area and respiratory function. Using mouse models, we show that alveolar type 1 (AT1) cell plasticity is a major and unappreciated mechanism that drives regeneration, beginning in the early postnatal period during alveolar maturation. Upon acute neonatal lung injury, AT1 cells reprogram into alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, promoting alveolar regeneration. In contrast, the ability of AT2 cells to regenerate AT1 cells is restricted to the mature lung. Unbiased genomic assessment reveals that this previously unappreciated level of plasticity is governed by the preferential activity of Hippo signaling in the AT1 cell lineage. Thus, cellular plasticity is a temporally acquired trait of the alveolar epithelium and presents an alternative mode of tissue regeneration in the postnatal lung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the enveloped RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal samples, and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We enrolled 98 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity (3 asymptomatic, 53 mild, 34 moderate, 5 severe, 3 critical) and 78 non-COVID-19 controls matched for gender and co-morbidities. All subjects had fecal specimens sampled at inclusion. Blood specimens were collected for COVID-19 patients at admission to test for inflammatory markers and white cell counts. Among COVID-19 cases, 37 (38%) patients had serial fecal samples collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until after discharge. Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, we sequenced and profiled the fecal RNA and DNA virome. We investigated alterations and longitudinal dynamics of the gut virome in association with disease severity and blood parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Patients with COVID-19 showed underrepresentation of Pepper mild mottle virus (RNA virus) and multiple bacteriophage lineages (DNA viruses) and enrichment of environment-derived eukaryotic DNA viruses in fecal samples, compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Such gut virome alterations persisted up to 30 days after disease resolution. Fecal virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection harbored more stress-, inflammation-, and virulence-associated gene encoding capacities including those pertaining to bacteriophage integration, DNA repair, and metabolism and virulence associated with their bacterial host. Baseline fecal abundance of 10 virus species (1 RNA virus, pepper chlorotic spot virus, and 9 DNA virus species) inversely correlated with disease COVID-19 severity. These viruses inversely correlated with blood levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, white cells, and neutrophils. Among the 10 COVID-19 severity-associated DNA virus species, 4 showed inverse correlation with age; 5 showed persistent lower abundance both during disease course and after disease resolution relative to non-COVID-19 subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Both enteric RNA and DNA virome in COVID-19 patients were different from non-COVID-19 subjects, which persisted after disease resolution of COVID-19. Gut virome may calibrate host immunity and regulate severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observation that gut viruses inversely correlated with both severity of COVID-19 and host age may partly explain that older subjects are prone to severe and worse COVID-19 outcomes. Altogether, our data highlight the importance of human gut virome in severity and potentially therapeutics of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung virome: New potential biomarkers for asthma severity and exacerbation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33757721/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Although some respiratory virus infections are known to contribute to the development and exacerbation of asthma, commensal viromes in airway have not been extensively studied due to technical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; This study investigated the characteristics of the virome in asthmatic airways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Both the bacteriome and virome profiles in sputum from 12 healthy individuals, 15 patients with nonsevere asthma, and 15 patients with severe asthma were analyzed and assessed for the association with clinical characteristics such as severity, exacerbation, Asthma Control Test (ACT), and lung function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; While analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA bacteriome in the airway showed no differences, clear contrasts in the diversity and composition of airway viromes were observed between healthy controls and patients with asthma. Herpesviruses were the most abundant type of virus in the asthma group (44.6 ± 4.6%), mainly with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and EBV accounting for 24.5 ± 3.3% and 16.9 ± 3.5%, respectively, in contrast to those in the healthy controls (5.4 ± 2.5% and 7.1 ± 3.0%, respectively). CMV and EBV were more abundant in patients with asthma who experienced exacerbation, and their abundance showed correlation with more severe asthma, lower ACT score, and lower lung function. On the contrary, bacteriophage that is abundant in healthy controls was severely reduced in patients with asthma in the order of nonsevere and severe asthma and presented significant positive correlation with ACT and FEV1/forced vital capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Lung viromes, especially, CMV, EBV, and bacteriophage may be potential biomarkers of asthma severity and exacerbation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrated gut virome and bacteriome dynamics in COVID-19 patients</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33678150/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the current global pandemic of COVID-19; this virus infects multiple organs, such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. The microbiome in these organs, including the bacteriome and virome, responds to infection and might also influence disease progression and treatment outcome. In a cohort of 13 COVID-19 patients in Beijing, China, we observed that the gut virome and bacteriome in the COVID-19 patients were notably different from those of five healthy controls. We identified a bacterial dysbiosis signature by observing reduced diversity and viral shifts in patients, and among the patients, the bacterial/viral compositions were different between patients of different severities, although these differences are not entirely distinguishable from the effect of antibiotics. Severe cases of COVID-19 exhibited a greater abundance of opportunistic pathogens but were depleted for butyrate-producing groups of bacteria compared with mild to moderate cases. We replicated our findings in a mouse COVID-19 model, confirmed virome differences and bacteriome dysbiosis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and observed that immune/infection-related genes were differentially expressed in gut epithelial cells during infection, possibly explaining the virome and bacteriome dynamics. Our results suggest that the components of the microbiome, including the bacteriome and virome, are affected by SARS-CoV-2 infections, while their compositional signatures could reflect or even contribute to disease severity and recovery processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SRSF1 inhibits autophagy through regulating Bcl-x splicing and interacting with PIK3C3 in lung cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33664238/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative splicing is a critical process to generate protein diversity. However, whether and how alternative splicing regulates autophagy remains largely elusive. Here we systematically identify the splicing factor SRSF1 as an autophagy suppressor. Specifically, SRSF1 inhibits autophagosome formation by reducing the accumulation of LC3-II and numbers of autophagosomes in different cell lines. Mechanistically, SRSF1 promotes the splicing of the long isoform of Bcl-x that interacts with Beclin1, thereby dissociating the Beclin1-PIK3C3 complex. In addition, SRSF1 also directly interacts with PIK3C3 to disrupt the interaction between Beclin1 and PIK3C3. Consequently, the decrease of SRSF1 stabilizes the Beclin1 and PIK3C3 complex and activates autophagy. Interestingly, SRSF1 can be degraded by starvation- and oxidative stresses-induced autophagy through interacting with LC3-II, whereas reduced SRSF1 further promotes autophagy. This positive feedback is critical to inhibiting Gefitinib-resistant cancer cell progression both in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, the expression level of SRSF1 is inversely correlated to LC3 level in clinical cancer samples. Our study not only provides mechanistic insights of alternative splicing in autophagy regulation but also discovers a new regulatory role of SRSF1 in tumorigenesis, thereby offering a novel avenue for potential cancer therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung Myofibroblasts Promote Macrophage Profibrotic Activity through Lactate-induced Histone Lactylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33074715/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augmented glycolysis due to metabolic reprogramming in lung myofibroblasts is critical to their profibrotic phenotype. The primary glycolysis byproduct, lactate, is also secreted into the extracellular milieu, together with which myofibroblasts and macrophages form a spatially restricted site usually described as fibrotic niche. Therefore, we hypothesized that myofibroblast glycolysis might have a non-cell autonomous effect through lactate regulating the pathogenic phenotype of alveolar macrophages. Here, we demonstrated that there was a markedly increased lactate in the conditioned media of TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-β1)-induced lung myofibroblasts and in the BAL fluids (BALFs) from mice with TGF-β1- or bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Importantly, the media and BALFs promoted profibrotic mediator expression in macrophages. Mechanistically, lactate induced histone lactylation in the promoters of the profibrotic genes in macrophages, consistent with the upregulation of this epigenetic modification in these cells in the fibrotic lungs. The lactate inductions of the histone lactylation and profibrotic gene expression were mediated by p300, as evidenced by their diminished concentrations in p300-knockdown macrophages. Collectively, our study establishes that in addition to protein, lipid, and nucleic acid molecules, a metabolite can also mediate intercellular regulations in the setting of lung fibrosis. Our findings shed new light on the mechanism underlying the key contribution of myofibroblast glycolysis to the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification and Validation of Autophagy-Related Genes in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33469280/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Autophagy plays essential roles in the development of COPD. We aim to identify and validate the potential autophagy-related genes of COPD through bioinformatics analysis and experiment validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The mRNA expression profile dataset GSE38974 was obtained from GEO database. The potential differentially expressed autophagy-related genes of COPD were screened by R software. Then, protein–protein interactions (PPI), correlation analysis, gene-ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were applied for the differentially expressed autophagy-related genes. Finally, RNA expression of top five differentially expressed autophagy-related genes was validated in blood samples from COPD patients and healthy controls by qRT-PCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 40 differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (14 up-regulated genes and 26 down-regulated genes) were identified between 23 COPD patients and 9 healthy controls. The PPI results demonstrated that these autophagy-related genes interacted with each other. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed autophagy-related genes indicated several enriched terms related to autophagy and mitophagy. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CDKN1A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BAG3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ERBB2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ATG16L1&lt;/em&gt; in COPD patients and healthy controls were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis results from mRNA microarray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We identified 40 potential autophagy-related genes of COPD through bioinformatics analysis. &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CDKN1A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BAG3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ERBB2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ATG16L1&lt;/em&gt; may affect the development of COPD by regulating autophagy. These results may expand our understanding of COPD and might be useful in the treatment of COPD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A molecular cell atlas of the human lung from single-cell RNA sequencing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although single-cell RNA sequencing studies have begun to provide compendia of cell expression profiles, it has been difficult to systematically identify and localize all molecular cell types in individual organs to create a full molecular cell atlas. Here, using droplet- and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing of approximately 75,000 human cells across all lung tissue compartments and circulating blood, combined with a multi-pronged cell annotation approach, we create an extensive cell atlas of the human lung. We define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 out of 45 previously known cell types and 14 previously unknown ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas identifies the biochemical functions of lung cells and the transcription factors and markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signalling interactions and immune cell homing; and identifies cell types that are directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory viruses. By comparing human and mouse data, we identified 17 molecular cell types that have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others with substantially altered expression profiles, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell-type-specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types. This atlas provides the molecular foundation for investigating how lung cell identities, functions and interactions are achieved in development and tissue engineering and altered in disease and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal stem cells alleviate LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the proinflammatory function of Ly6C&#43; CD8&#43; T cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33024074/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systemic inflammatory processes, including alveolar injury, cytokine induction, and neutrophil accumulation, play key roles in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury (ALI). The immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can contribute to the treatment of inflammatory disorders. In previous studies, the focus was on innate immune cells and the effects of MSCs on ALI through CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells remain unclear. In the present study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce ALI in mice. ALI mice were treated with MSCs via intratracheal instillation. Survival rate, histopathological changes, protein levels, total cell count, cytokine levels, and chemokine levels in alveolar lavage fluid were used to determine the efficacy of MSCs. Mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were used to characterize the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the lungs. Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are prevalent in normal mice, whereas a specialized effector phenotype expressing a high level of Ly6C is predominant in advanced disease. MSCs significantly mitigated ALI and improved survival. MSCs decreased the infiltration of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, especially Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells into the lungs. Mass cytometry revealed that CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells expressing high Ly6C and CXCR3 levels caused tissue damage in the lungs of ALI mice, which was alleviated by MSCs. The scRNA-seq showed that Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells exhibited a more activated phenotype and decreased expression of proinflammatory factors that were enriched the most in immune chemotaxis after treatment with MSCs. We showed that CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells play an important role in MSC-mediated ALI remission, and both infiltration quantity and proinflammatory function were inhibited by MSCs, indicating a potential mechanism for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immunosuppressive effects of mesenchymal stem cells on lung B cell gene expression in LPS-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32977837/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Immune system disorders play important roles in acute lung injury (ALI), and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment can reduce inflammation during ALI. In this study, we compared the changes in lung B cells during MSC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the effects of MSCs on lung B cells in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. MSCs were administered intratracheally 4 h after LPS. As vehicle-treated controls, mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% C57BL/6 (PBS group). Histopathological changes, survival rate, inflammatory factor levels, and the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis was performed to evaluate the transcriptional changes in lung B cells between the PBS, LPS, and LPS/MSC groups on days 3 and 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MSC treatment ameliorated LPS-induced ALI, as indicated by the reductions in mortality, the levels of chemokines and cytokines in BALF, and the severity of lung tissue histopathology in ALI mice. Lung B cells in the PBS group remained undifferentiated and had an inhibitory phenotype. Based on our scRNA-Seq results, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lung B cells in both the PBS group and LPS group were involved in chemotaxis processes and some proinflammatory pathways. MSC treatment inhibited the expression of chemokine genes that were upregulated by LPS and were related to the recruitment of neutrophils into lung tissues. Immunoglobulin-related gene expression was decreased in lung B cells of mice treated with LPS/MSC for 7 days. The DEGs regulated by MSCs were enriched in biological processes, including humoral immune response and apoptotic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Lung B cells played an important role in the effects of treatment of ALI with MSCs. These observations provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of MSC treatment for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tissue regeneration is a multi-step process mediated by diverse cellular hierarchies and states that are also implicated in tissue dysfunction and pathogenesis. Here we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing in combination with in vivo lineage tracing and organoid models to finely map the trajectories of alveolar-lineage cells during injury repair and lung regeneration. We identified a distinct AT2-lineage population, damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs), that arises during alveolar regeneration. We found that interstitial macrophage-derived IL-1β primes a subset of AT2 cells expressing Il1r1 for conversion into DATPs via a HIF1α-mediated glycolysis pathway, which is required for mature AT1 cell differentiation. Importantly, chronic inflammation mediated by IL-1β prevents AT1 differentiation, leading to aberrant accumulation of DATPs and impaired alveolar regeneration. Together, this stepwise mapping to cell fate transitions shows how an inflammatory niche controls alveolar regeneration by controlling stem cell fate and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Altered Gut Microbiome Profile in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is considered a disease of the pulmonary vasculature. Limited progress has been made in preventing or arresting progression of PAH despite extensive efforts. Our previous studies indicated that PAH could be considered a systemic disease since its pathology involves interplay of multiple organs. This, coupled with increasing implication of the gut and its microbiome in chronic diseases, led us to hypothesize that patients with PAH exhibit a distinct gut microbiome that contributes to, and predicts, the disease. Fecal microbiome of 18 type 1 PAH patients (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 57.4, SD 16.7 mm Hg) and 13 reference subjects were compared by shotgun metagenomics to evaluate this hypothesis. Significant taxonomic and functional changes in microbial communities in the PAH cohort were observed. Pathways for the synthesis of arginine, proline, and ornithine were increased in PAH cohort compared with reference cohort. Additionally, groups of bacterial communities associated with trimethylamine/ trimethylamine N-oxide and purine metabolism were increased in PAH cohort. In contrast, butyrate-and propionate-producing bacteria such as Coprococcus, Butyrivibrio, Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, Akkermansia, and Bacteroides were increased in reference cohort. A random forest model predicted PAH from the composition of the gut microbiome with 83% accuracy. Finally, virome analysis showed enrichment of Enterococcal and relative depletion of Lactococcal phages in the PAH cohort. In conclusion, patients with PAH exhibit a unique microbiome profile that has the high predictive potential for PAH. This highlights previously unknown roles of gut bacteria in this disease and could lead to new therapeutic, diagnostic, or management paradigms for PAH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lung is inhabited by resident alveolar and interstitial macrophages as well as monocytic cells that survey lung tissues. Each cell type plays distinct functional roles under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions, but mechanisms establishing their molecular identities and functional potential remain poorly understood. In the present study, systematic evaluation of transcriptomes and open chromatin of alveolar macrophages (AMs), interstitial macrophages (IMs) and lung monocytes from two mouse strains enabled inference of common and cell-specific transcriptional regulators. We provide evidence that these factors drive selection of regulatory landscapes that specify distinct phenotypes of AMs and IMs and entrain qualitatively different responses to toll-like receptor 4 signaling in vivo. These studies reveal a striking divergence in a fundamental innate immune response pathway in AMs and establish a framework for further understanding macrophage diversity in the lung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibrosis can develop in most organs and causes organ failure. The most common type of lung fibrosis is known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in which fibrosis starts at the lung periphery and then progresses toward the lung center, eventually causing respiratory failure. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and periphery-to-center progression of the disease. Here we discovered that loss of Cdc42 function in alveolar stem cells (AT2 cells) causes periphery-to-center progressive lung fibrosis. We further show that Cdc42-null AT2 cells in both post-pneumonectomy and untreated aged mice cannot regenerate new alveoli, resulting in sustained exposure of AT2 cells to elevated mechanical tension. We demonstrate that elevated mechanical tension activates a TGF-β signaling loop in AT2 cells, which drives the periphery-to-center progression of lung fibrosis. Our study establishes a direct mechanistic link between impaired alveolar regeneration, mechanical tension, and progressive lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Age-Related Dopaminergic Innervation Augments T Helper 2-Type Allergic Inflammation in the Postnatal Lung</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young children are more susceptible to developing allergic asthma than adults. As neural innervation of the peripheral tissue continues to develop after birth, neurons may modulate tissue inflammation in an age-related manner. Here we showed that sympathetic nerves underwent a dopaminergic-to-adrenergic transition during post-natal development of the lung in mice and humans. Dopamine signaled through a specific dopamine receptor (DRD4) to promote T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation. The dopamine-DRD4 pathway acted synergistically with the cytokine IL-4 by upregulating IL-2-STAT5 signaling and reducing inhibitory histone trimethylation at Th2 gene loci. In murine models of allergen exposure, the dopamine-DRD4 pathway augmented Th2 inflammation in the lungs of young mice. However, this pathway operated marginally after sympathetic nerves became adrenergic in the adult lung. Taken together, the communication between dopaminergic nerves and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells provides an age-related mechanism underlying the susceptibility to allergic inflammation in the early lung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting Degradation of the Transcription Factor C/EBPβ Reduces Lung Fibrosis by Restoring Activity of the Ubiquitin-Editing Enzyme A20 in Macrophages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although recent progress provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), rare anti-PF therapeutics show definitive promise for treating this disease. Repeated lung epithelial injury results in injury-repairing response and inflammation, which drive the development of PF. Here, we report that chronic lung injury inactivated the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, causing progressive accumulation of the transcription factor C/EBPβ in alveolar macrophages (AMs) from PF patients and mice, which upregulated a number of immunosuppressive and profibrotic factors promoting PF development. In response to chronic lung injury, elevated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) interacted with and phosphorylated A20 to suppress C/EBPβ degradation. Ectopic expression of A20 or pharmacological restoration of A20 activity by disturbing the A20-GSK-3β interaction accelerated C/EBPβ degradation and showed potent therapeutic efficacy against experimental PF. Our study indicates that a regulatory mechanism of the GSK-3β-A20-C/EBPβ axis in AMs may be a potential target for treating PF and fibroproliferative lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tolerogenic signaling of alveolar macrophages induces lung adaptation to oxidative injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31356919/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inhaled oxidative toxicants present in ambient air cause airway epithelial injury, inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Effective adaptation to such environmental insults is essential for the preservation of pulmonary function, whereas failure or incomplete adaptation to oxidative injury can render the host susceptible to the development of airway disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; We sought to explore the mechanisms of airway adaptation to oxidative injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; For a model to study pulmonary adaptation to oxidative stress-induced lung injury, we exposed mice to repeated nose-only chlorine gas exposures. Outcome measures were evaluated 24 hours after the last chlorine exposure. Lung mechanics and airway responsiveness to methacholine were assessed by using the flexiVent. Inflammation and antioxidant responses were assessed in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue. Using both loss or gain of function and genomic approaches, we further dissected the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in pulmonary adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Repeated exposures to oxidative stress resulted in pulmonary adaptation evidenced by abrogation of neutrophilic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. This adaptation was independent of antioxidant mechanisms and regulatory T cells but dependent on residential alveolar macrophages (AMs). Interestingly, 5% of AMs expressed forkhead box P3, and depletion of these cells abolished adaptation. Results from transcriptomic profiling and loss and gain of function suggest that adaptation might be dependent on TGF-β and prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Pulmonary adaptation during oxidative stress-induced lung injury is mediated by a novel subset of forkhead box P3-positive AMs that limits inflammation, favoring airway adaptation and host fitness through TGF-β and prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent histotype of non-small cell lung cancer. Anoikis, an alternative form of programmed cell death, plays a pivotal role in cancer invasion and metastasis, preventing the detached cancer cells from readhering to other substrates for abnormal proliferation. The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive analyses of the prognostic implications of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in LUAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; ARGs were selected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Genecards dataset using differential expression analysis. The signature incorporating ARGs was identified using univariate Cox regression analysis and LASSO regression analysis. Furthermore, a nomogram containing the signature and clinical information was developed through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the predictive validity of these risk models. Finally, functional analysis of the selected ARGs in signature and analysis of immune landscape were also conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A 16-gene signature was integrated to stratify LUAD patients into different survival risk groups. The prognostic risk score generated from the signature and TNM stage were identified as independent prognostic factors and utilized to develop a nomogram. Both the signature and the nomogram showed satisfactory prediction performance in predicting overall survival (OS) of LUAD patients. The ARGs were enriched in several biological functions and signaling pathways. Finally, differences of immune landscape were investigated among the high- and low-risk groups stratified by the signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study revealed potential relationships between ARGs and prognosis of LUAD. The prognostic predictors identified in present study could be utilized as potential biomarkers for clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lactoferrin Ameliorates Ovalbumin-Induced Asthma in Mice through Reducing Dendritic-Cell-Derived Th2 Cell Responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36430662/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease with symptoms such as expiratory airflow narrowing and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Millions of people suffer from asthma and are at risk of life-threatening conditions. Lactoferrin (LF) is a glycoprotein with multiple physiological functions, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antitumoral activities. LF has been shown to function in immunoregulatory activities in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) in mice. Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of LF in AHR and the functions of dendritic cells (DCs) and Th2-related responses in asthma. Twenty 8-week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into normal control (NC), ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized, and OVA-sensitized with low dose of LF (100 mg/kg) or high dose of LF (300 mg/kg) treatment groups. The mice were challenged by intranasal instillation with 5% OVA on the 21st to 27th day after the start of the sensitization period. The AHR, cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and pulmonary histology of each mouse were measured. Serum OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 and OVA-specific splenocyte responses were further detected. The results showed that LF exhibited protective effects in ameliorating AHR, as well as lung inflammation and damage, in reducing the expression of Th2 cytokines and the secretion of allergen-specific antibodies, in influencing the functions of DCs, and in decreasing the level of Th2 immune responses in a BALB/c mouse model of OVA-induced allergic asthma. Importantly, we demonstrated that LF has practical application in reducing DC-induced Th2 cell responses in asthma. In conclusion, LF exhibits anti-inflammation and immunoregulation activities in OVA-induced allergic asthma. These results suggest that LF may act as a supplement to prevent asthma-induced lung injury and provide an additional agent for reducing asthma severity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal stem cell-mediated immunomodulation of recruited mononuclear phagocytes during acute lung injury: a high-dimensional analysis study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33500722/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI)-recruited mononuclear phagocytes play a pivotal role in lung injury and repair. This study investigated the types of recruited mononuclear phagocytes and the immunotherapeutic effects of allograft mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice were orotracheally instilled with LPS (20 mg/kg). Compact bone-derived MSCs were administered orotracheally 4 h after LPS inhalation. Mononuclear phagocytes recruited in the lung tissues were characterized at different timepoints by high-dimensional analysis including flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Eight mononuclear phagocyte subsets recruited to LPS-challenged lungs were precisely identified. On day 3 after LPS administration, both Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes were recruited into acutely injured lungs, which was associated with increased secretion of neutrophil chemokines. Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes differentiated into M1 macrophages on day 3, and subsequently differentiated into CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) on day 7, while Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes differentiated into CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs on day 7. When ALI mice were treated with MSCs, the mortality significantly reduced. Notably, MSCs reduced the amount of M1 macrophages and reduced the secretion of neutrophil chemokines on day 3. Furthermore, MSCs reduced the number of CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mo-DCs and CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs on day 7, suppressing the antigen presentation process. Recruited mononuclear phagocyte subsets with a high level of CD38 exhibited an activated phenotype and could secrete higher levels of cytokines and chemokines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study characterized the dynamic functions and phenotypes of recruited mononuclear phagocytes in ALI mice and MSC-treated ALI mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I establishment of (ventilator-induced acute lung injury) VILI rat model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used bioinformatics software to predict the target gene of miR-9a-5p, and verified the conclusion through double Luciferase Report experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) through lavage fluid recovery technology for experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Globally, Mechanical ventilation is the most commonly used short-term life support technology. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is an inflammatory injury caused by mechanical ventilation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as new gene regulators that play an important role in lung injury and inflammation. However, the role and mechanism of action of miR-9a-5p in VILI remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Herein, a rat model of VILI was established. To determine the expression levels of miR-9a-5p and CXCR4 mRNA, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were conducted. As well as western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence analyses, we determined the expression of CXCR4, SDF-1 and MAPK signaling pathway-related kinases. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining and the wet-dry ratio of the lung tissue were used to evaluate organ injury. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity measurements were performed to evaluate the inflammatory response. In addition, double luciferase reporter assays were used to verify the association between miR-9a-5p and CXCR4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The expression of miR-9a-5p was low, whereas that of CXCR4 was high in the lung tissues of VILI rats. The overexpression of miR-9a-5p alleviated the degree of pathological injury in the lung tissues of rats with VILI, downregulating inflammatory cytokine expression and MPO activity. In the VILI rat model, miR-9a-5p targeted the negative regulation of CXCR4, and CXCR4 overexpression to reverse the lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of miR-9a-5p overexpression in VILI rats. miR-9a-5p also inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal receptor-activated kinase (ERK), a protein related to the MAPK signaling pathway, by downregulating CXCR4 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; miR-9a-5p can hinder the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and reduce inflammatory reactions and lung injury in VILI rats through the targeted regulation of CXCR4 expression. Therefore, miR-9a-5p could serve as an intervention target to supply a new strategy for the care of VILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Proteomic and phosphorylated proteomic landscape of injured lung in juvenile septic rats with therapeutic application of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is the most common complication of sepsis. Intravenous injection of HUMSCs can regulate the level of circulating endothelial cytokines and alleviate lung injury in juvenile septic rats. In this study, we performed proteomic and phosphorylated proteomic analysis of lung tissue of juvenile septic rats after Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (HUMSCs) intervention for the first time, and screened the potential proteins and pathways of HUMSCs for therapeutic effect. The 4D proteome quantitative technique was used to quantitatively analyze the lung tissues of septic rats 24 hours (3 biological samples) and 24 hours after HUMSCs intervention (3 biological samples). A total of 213 proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins, and 971 phosphorylation sites changed significantly. Based on the public database, we analyzed the functional enrichment of these proteins and phosphorylated proteins. In addition, Tenascin-C may be the key differential protein and ECM receptor interaction pathway may be the main signal pathway by using various algorithms to analyze the protein-protein interaction network. Phosphorylation analysis showed that tight junction pathway was closely related to immune inflammatory reaction, and EGFR interacted most, which may be the key differential phosphorylated protein. Finally, 123 conserved motifs of serine phosphorylation site (pS) and 17 conserved motifs of threonine (pT) phosphorylation sites were identified by motif analysis of phosphorylation sites. Results from proteomics and phosphorylated proteomics, the potential new therapeutic targets of HUMSCs in alleviating lung injury in juvenile septic rats were revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
