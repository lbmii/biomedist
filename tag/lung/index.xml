      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary inflammation as one of the extraintestinal manifestations of ulcerative colitis (UC) has attracted extensive attention, and its pathogenesis is closely related to gut dysbiosis. &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis&lt;/em&gt; subsp. lactis BL-99 (BL-99) can alleviate osteoporosis caused by UC, but less research has been done on other extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) caused by UC. This study aimed to explore the role and potential mechanisms of BL-99 on DSS-induced pulmonary complications in colitis mice. The results showed that BL-99 decreased weight loss, disease activity index score, colonic pathology score, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in colitis mice. BL-99 also alleviated DSS-induced lung pathological damage by suppressing the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory monocytes, and macrophages. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed lower abundances of several potentially pathogenic bacteria (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Burkholderia, Shigella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/em&gt;) and enrichment in specific beneficial bacteria (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Adlercreutzia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis&lt;/em&gt;) in colitis mice with BL-99 treatment. Targeted metabolomics suggested that BL-99 intervention promoted the production of intestinal acetate and butyrate. Finally, we observed that the pulmonary expression of primary acetate and butyrate receptors, including FFAR2, FFAR3, and, GPR109a, was up-regulated in BL-99-treated mice, which negatively correlated with inflammatory monocytes and macrophages. Altogether, these results suggest that BL-99 might be utilized as a probiotic intervention to prevent the incidence of colitis-related lung injury owing to its ability to shape the intestinal microbiota and suppress inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>c-JUN-mediated transcriptional responses in lymphatic endothelial cells are required for lung fluid clearance at birth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluid clearance mediated by lymphatic vessels is known to be essential for lung inflation and gas-exchange function during the transition from prenatal to postnatal life, yet the molecular mechanisms that regulate lymphatic function remain unclear. Here, we profiled the molecular features of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in embryonic and postnatal day (P) 0 lungs by single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. We identified that the expression of c-JUN is transiently upregulated in P0 LECs. Conditional knockout of Jun in LECs impairs the opening of lung lymphatic vessels at birth, leading to fluid retention in the lungs and neonatal death. We further demonstrated that increased mechanical pressure induces the expression of c-JUN in LECs. c-JUN regulates the opening of lymphatic vessels by modulating the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in LECs. Our study established the essential regulatory function of c-JUN-mediated transcriptional responses in facilitating lung lymphatic fluid clearance at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Maresin 1-LGR6 axis decreases respiratory syncytial virus-induced lung inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36595677/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution of infection is an active process with specific molecular and cellular mechanisms that temper inflammation and enhance pathogen clearance. Here, the specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) Maresin 1 (MaR1) inhibited respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced inflammation. inlerleukin-13 production from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC) and CD4 T helper type 2 cells was decreased by exogenous MaR1. In addition, MaR1 increased amphiregulin production and decreased RSV viral transcripts to promote resolution. MaR1 also promoted interferon-β production in mouse lung tissues and also in pediatric lung slices. MaR1 significantly inhibited the RSV-triggered aberrant inflammatory phenotype in FoxP3-expressing Tregs. The receptor for MaR1, leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6), was constitutively expressed on Tregs. Following RSV infection, mice lacking Lgr6 had exacerbated type 2 immune responses with an increased viral burden and blunted responses to MaR1. Together, these findings have uncovered a multi-pronged protective signaling axis for MaR1-Lgr6, improving Tregs&amp;rsquo;s suppressive function and upregulating host antiviral genes resulting in decreased viral burden and pathogen-mediated inflammation, ultimately promoting restoration of airway mucosal homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>miRNome profiling of lung cancer metastases revealed a key role for miRNA-PD-L1 axis in the modulation of chemotherapy response</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is frequent at diagnosis and requires multimodal treatment approaches. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by surgery is the treatment of choice for operable locally advanced NSCLC (Stage IIIA). However, the majority of patients are NACT-resistant and show persistent lymph nodal metastases (LNmets) and an adverse outcome. Therefore, the identification of mechanisms and biomarkers of NACT resistance is paramount for ameliorating the prognosis of patients with Stage IIIA NSCLC. Here, we investigated the miRNome and transcriptome of chemo-naïve LNmets collected from patients with Stage IIIA NSCLC (N = 64). We found that a microRNA signature accurately predicts NACT response. Mechanistically, we discovered a miR-455-5p/PD-L1 regulatory axis which drives chemotherapy resistance, hallmarks metastases with active IFN-γ response pathway (an inducer of PD-L1 expression), and impacts T cells viability and relative abundances in tumor microenvironment (TME). Our data provide new biomarkers to predict NACT response and add molecular insights relevant for improving the management of patients with locally advanced NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>De Novo Design of Activatable Photoacoustic/Fluorescent Probes for Imaging Acute Lung Injury In Vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36584357/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective monitoring of the physiological progression of acute lung injury (ALI) in real time is crucial for early theranostics to reduce its high mortality. In particular, activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic molecule probes have attracted attention to assess ALI by detecting related indicators. However, the existing fluorophores often encounter issues of low retention in the lungs and slow clearance from the body, which compromise the probe&amp;rsquo;s actual capability for in situ imaging by intravenous injection in vivo. Herein, a novel near-infrared hemicyanines fluorophore (FJH) bearing a quaternary ammonium group was first developed by combining with the rational design and screening strategy. The properties of good hydrophilicity and blood circulation effectively enable FJH accumulation for lung imaging. Inspired by the high retention efficiency, the probe FJH-C that turns on fluorescence and photoacoustic signals in response to the ALI indicator (esterase) was subsequently synthesized. Notably, the probe FJH-C successfully achieved the selectivity and sensitivity toward esterase in vitro and in living cells. More importantly, FJH-C can be further used to assess lipopolysaccharides and silica-induced ALI through the desired fluo-photoacoustic signal. Therefore, this study not only shows the first activatable probe for real-time imaging of lung function but also highlights the fluorophore structure with high lung retention. It is believed that FJH and FJH-C can serve as an efficient platform to reveal the pathological progression of other lung diseases for early diagnosis and medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interactions of Inhaled Liposome with Macrophages and Neutrophils Determine Particle Biofate and Anti-Inflammatory Effect in Acute Lung Inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36583377/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most current studies have focused on exploring how phagocyte internalization of drug-loaded nanovesicles by macrophages would affect the function and therapeutic effects of infiltrated neutrophils or monocytes, research has evaluated the specificity of the inhaled nanovesicles for targeting various phagocytes subpopulations. In this study, liposomes with various charges (including neutral (L1), anionic (L2), and cationic at inflammatory sites (L3)) were constructed to investigate how particle charge determined their interactions with key phagocytes (including macrophages and neutrophils) in acute lung injury (ALI) models and to establish correlations with their biofate and overall anti-inflammatory effect. Our results clearly indicated that neutrophils were capable of rapidly sequestering L3 with a 3.2-fold increase in the cellular liposome distribution, compared to that in AMs, while 70.5% of L2 were preferentially uptaken by alveolar macrophages (AMs). Furthermore, both AMs and the infiltrated neutrophils performed as the potential vesicles for the inhaled liposomes to prolong their lung retention in ALI models, whereas AMs function as sweepers to recognize and process liposomes in the healthy lung. Finally, inhaled roflumilast-loaded macrophage or neutrophil preferential liposomes (L2 or L3) exhibited optimal anti-inflammatory effect because of the decreased AMs phagocytic capacity or the prolonged circulation times of neutrophils. Such findings will be beneficial in exploiting a potential pathway to specifically manipulate lung phagocyte functions in lung inflammatory diseases where these cells play crucial roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. alleviate LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. protect mice by reducing pulmonary edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. inhibit the influx of inflammatory cells into the lung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. reduce inflammation in the lung by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common respiratory disease in clinics, which is characterized by alveolar-capillary membrane loss, plasma protein leakage, pulmonary edema, massive neutrophil infiltration, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators. Rhodiola rosea L. an adaptogenic plant rich in phenylethanoloids, phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. We hope to verify the relieving effect of total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. (RTG) on ALI in mice and clarify its mechanism through this study. In this study, we identified the effect and mechanism of RTG on ALI through LPS-induced ALI mice. After RTG treatment, the pathological structure of lung tissue in ALI mice induced by LPS was significantly improved, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells was reduced. In addition, RTG reduced the production of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the serum of ALI mice and reduced the content or activity of MPO, T-SOD, GSH, and MDA in lung tissue. RNAseq analysis showed that RTG ameliorated LPS-induced ALI through anti-inflammatory, reduced immune response, and anti-apoptotic activities. The western blotting analysis confirmed that RTG could down-regulate the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB p65, and p-IκBα/IκBα. These results suggest that RTG can attenuate LPS-induced ALI through antioxidants and inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD-L1 upregulation promotes drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting vimentin degradation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36586643/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with high mortality and limited therapeutic options. The immune checkpoint PD1/PD-L1 axis is related to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, and upregulated expression levels of PD-L1 have been demonstrated in IPF patients. However, the mechanism of PD-L1 in pulmonary fibrosis is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated upregulated expression of PD-L1 in fibrotic lung tissues and sera of IPF patients. Bleomycin (BLM) treatment induced PD-L1 upregulation, EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition) and fibrosis-like morphology changes in human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiCs). Silencing PD-L1 attenuated BLM-induced EMT and fibrosis-like morphology changes in HPAEpiCs. In addition, we identified that PD-L1 directly binds to vimentin and inhibits vimentin ubiquitination, thereby increasing vimentin levels in HPAEpiCs. Silencing of vimentin inhibited BLM- and PD-L1-induced fibrosis in HPAEpiCs. The correlation between PD-L1 and EMT or vimentin expression was further confirmed in clinical samples and animal models. Finally, we used BLM- and paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis animal models to confirm the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects of PD-L1 silencing. Taken together, our findings suggest that upregulated PD-L1 stimulates EMT of alveolar epithelial cells by increasing vimentin levels by inhibiting vimentin ubiquitination, thereby contributing to pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self-Assembly of Antimicrobial Peptide-Based Micelles Breaks the Limitation of Trypsin</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36577517/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting the limitation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) application in vivo, self-assembled AMPs library with specific nanostructures is expected to gradually overtake monomer AMPs libraries in the future. Peptide polymers are fascinating self-assembling nanoscale structures that have great advantage in biomedical applications because of their satisfactory biocompatibility and versatile properties. Herein, we describe a strategy for inducing the self-assembly of T9W into nanostructured antimicrobial micelles with evidently improved pharmacological properties, that is, PEGylation at the C-terminal of T9W (CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt;), an antibacterial biomaterial that self-assembles in aqueous media without exogenous excipients, has been developed. Compared with parental molecular, the CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; is more effective against &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, and its antibacterial spectrum had also been broadened. Additionally, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles had higher stability under salt ion, serum, and acid-base environments. Importantly, the self-assembled structure is highly resistant to trypsin degradation, probably allowing T9W to be applied in clinical settings in the future. Mechanistically, by acting on membranes and through supplementary bactericidal mechanisms, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles contribute to the antibacterial process. Collectively, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles exhibited good biocompatibility &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, resulting in highly effective treatment in a mouse acute lung injury model induced by &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 without drug resistance. These advances may profoundly accelerate the clinical transformation of T9W and promote the development of a combination of peptide-based antibiotics and PEGylated nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-33-ST2 pathway regulates AECII transdifferentiation by targeting alveolar macrophage in a bronchopulmonary dysplasia mouse model</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence points to the indispensable function of alveolar macrophages (AMs) in normal lung development and tissue homeostasis. However, the importance of AMs in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not been elucidated. Here, we identified a significant role of abnormal AM proliferation and polarization in alveolar dysplasia during BPD, which is closely related to the activation of the IL-33-ST2 pathway. Compared with the control BPD group, AMs depletion partially abolished the epithelialmesenchymal transition process of AECII and alleviated pulmonary differentiation arrest. In addition, IL-33 or ST2 knockdown has protective effects against lung injury after hyperoxia, which is associated with reduced AM polarization and proliferation. The protective effect disappeared following reconstitution of AMs in injured IL-33 knockdown mice, and the differentiation of lung epithelium was blocked again. In conclusion, the IL-33-ST2 pathway regulates AECII transdifferentiation by targeting AMs proliferation and polarization in BPD, which shows a novel strategy for manipulating the IL-33-ST2-AMs axis for the diagnosis and intervention of BPD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung injury is induced by abrupt increase in respiratory rate but prevented by recruitment maneuver in mild acute respiratory distress syndrome in rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36571572/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Gradually changing respiratory rate (RR) over time to reduce ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) has not been investigated. We hypothesized that gradual, compared to abrupt, increments in RR would mitigate VILI and that recruitment maneuver (RM) prior to abrupt increasing RR may prevent injurious biological impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Twenty-four hours after intratracheal administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, 49 male Wistar rats were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated (VT=6ml/kg, PEEP=3cmH2O) with RR increase patterns as follows (n=7/group): (1)control-1, RR=70bpm for 2h; (2) and (3)abrupt increases of RR for 1h and 2h, respectively, both for 2h; (4)shorter RR adaptation, gradually increasing RR (from 70 to 130bpm over 30min); (5)longer RR adaptation, more gradual increase in RR (from 70 to 130bpm over 60min), both for 2h; (6)control-2, abrupt increase of RR maintained for 1h; and (7)control-3, RM [CPAP=30cmH2O for 30s] followed by control-2 protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; At the end of 1h of mechanical ventilation, cumulative diffuse alveolar damage scores were lower in shorter (11.0 [8.0-12.0]) and longer (13.0 [11.0-14.0]) RR adaptation groups than in animals with abrupt increase of RR for 1 h (25.0 [22.0-26.0] p=0.035, and p=0.048, respectively) and 2 h (35.0 [32.0-39.0], p=0.003, and p=0.040, respectively); mechanical power and lung heterogeneity were lower, and alveolar integrity was higher, in the longer RR adaptation group compared with abruptly adjusted groups; markers of lung inflammation (IL-6), epithelial (CC-16) and endothelial cell damage (VCAM-1) were higher in both abrupt groups, but not in either RR adaptation group, compared with controls. RM prevented the increase in VCAM-1 and CC-16 gene expressions in the abruptly increased RR groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In mild experimental ARDS in rats, gradually increasing RR, compared with abruptly doing so, can mitigate the development of VILI. In addition, recruitment maneuver prevented the injurious biological impact of abrupt increases in RR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 15-30% of patients are likely to develop COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are still few effective and well-understood therapies available. Novel variants and short-lasting immunity are posing challenges to vaccine efficacy, so finding antiviral and antiinflammatory treatments remains crucial. Here, tripterin (TP), a traditional Chinese medicine, was encapsulated into liposome (TP lipo) to investigate its antiviral and antiinflammatory effects in severe COVID-19. By using two severe COVID-19 models in human ACE2-transgenic (hACE2) mice, an analysis of TP lipo&amp;rsquo;s effects on pulmonary immune responses was conducted. Pulmonary pathological alterations and viral burden were reduced by TP lipo treatment. TP lipo inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication and hyperinflammation in infected cells and mice, two crucial events in severe COVID-19 pathophysiology, it is a promising drug candidate to treat SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UHRF1-mediated ferroptosis promotes pulmonary fibrosis via epigenetic repression of GPX4 and FSP1 genes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36566325/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis (PF), as an end-stage clinical phenotype of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), is frequently initiated after alveolar injury, in which ferroptosis has been identified as a critical event aggravating the pathophysiological progression of this disease. Here in, a comprehensive analysis of two mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis developed in our lab demonstrated that lung damage-induced ferroptosis of alveolar epithelial Type2 cells (AEC2) significantly accumulates during the development of pulmonary fibrosis while ferroptosis suppressor genes GPX4 and FSP1 are dramatically inactivated. Mechanistically, upregulation of de novo methylation regulator Uhrf1 sensitively elevates CpG site methylation levels in promoters of both GPX4 and FSP1 genes and induces the epigenetic repression of both genes, subsequently leading to ferroptosis in chemically interfered AEC2 cells. Meanwhile, specific inhibition of UHRF1 highly arrests the ferroptosis formation and blocks the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in both of our research models. This study first, to our knowledge, identified the involvement of Uhrf1 in mediating the ferroptosis of chemically injured AEC2s via de novo promoter-specific methylation of both GPX4 and FSP1 genes, which consequently accelerates the process of pulmonary fibrosis. The above findings also strongly suggested Uhrf1 as a novel potential target in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiota modulates lung fibrosis severity following acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36543914/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent studies demonstrate the significance of gut microbiota on the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases; yet little is known regarding the role of the gut microbiota in lung fibrosis progression. Here we show, using the bleomycin murine model to quantify lung fibrosis in C57BL/6 J mice housed in germ-free, animal biosafety level 1 (ABSL-1), or animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL-2) environments, that germ-free mice are protected from lung fibrosis, while ABSL-1 and ABSL-2 mice develop mild and severe lung fibrosis, respectively. Metagenomic analysis reveals no notable distinctions between ABSL-1 and ABSL-2 lung microbiota, whereas greater microbial diversity, with increased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacilli, is present in ABSL-1 compared to ABSL-2 gut microbiota. Flow cytometric analysis reveals enhanced IL-6/STAT3/IL-17A signaling in pulmonary CD4 + T cells of ABSL-2 mice. Fecal transplantation of ABSL-2 stool into germ-free mice recapitulated more severe fibrosis than transplantation of ABSL-1 stool. Lactobacilli supernatant reduces collagen 1 A production in IL-17A- and TGFβ1-stimulated human lung fibroblasts. These findings support a functional role of the gut microbiota in augmenting lung fibrosis severity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A spatially resolved atlas of the human lung characterizes a gland-associated immune niche</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-cell transcriptomics has allowed unprecedented resolution of cell types/states in the human lung, but their spatial context is less well defined. To (re)define tissue architecture of lung and airways, we profiled five proximal-to-distal locations of healthy human lungs in depth using multi-omic single cell/nuclei and spatial transcriptomics at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lungcellatlas.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lung Cell Atlas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Using computational data integration and analysis, we extend beyond the suspension cell paradigm and discover macro and micro-anatomical tissue compartments including previously unannotated cell types in the epithelial, vascular, stromal and nerve bundle micro-environments. We identify and implicate peribronchial fibroblasts in lung disease. Importantly, we discover and validate a survival niche for IgA plasma cells in the airway submucosal glands (SMG). We show that gland epithelial cells recruit B cells and IgA plasma cells, and promote longevity and antibody secretion locally through expression of CCL28, APRIL and IL-6. This new ‘gland-associated immune niche’ has implications for respiratory health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BAP31 regulates the expression of ICAM-1/VCAM-1 via MyD88/NF-κB pathway in acute lung injury mice model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549351/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; The cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that mediate neutrophil-endothelium cell adhesion are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). B-cell receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31) has been reported to engage in the expression of some CAMs. This study was undertaken to explore whether BAP31 in endotheliocyte affects the pathological process of ALI by regulating CAMs, and its possible mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; Our study used the shBAP31 endothelium cell lines and endothelial-specific BAP31 conditional knockdown mice constructed via Cre/loxP system. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the histopathological manifestations. The adhesion of neutrophils to vascular wall was examined by intravital microscopy. The nuclear translocation of NF-κB was observed by immunofluorescence staining assay. Flow cytometric, real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assay were performed to determine the expression of CAMs and key proteins in MyD88/NF-κB-related signaling pathway. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were analyzed for transcriptional activity of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; Mechanistic investigations indicated that endothelium-specific BAP31 depletion dramatically reduced the capacity of neutrophils adherence to endothelial cells (ECs), which was mainly attributed to the significant downregulation of ICAM-1 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and VCAM-1 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) expression. Interestingly, BAP31 knockdown apparently deactivated MyD88/TRAF6-mediated TAK1/NF-κB and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades, resulting in the inhibition of NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; Our data furnished convincing evidence that BAP31 deficiency performs a mitigative effect on ALI by decreasing neutrophils-ECs adhesion. These findings identified BAP31 as a promising protein for regulating the pathogenesis process of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging roles of mechanosensitive ion channels in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36539808/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a devastating respiratory disorder with high rates of mortality and morbidity, but the detailed underlying mechanisms of ALI/ARDS remain largely unknown. Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), including epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Piezo channels, transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), and two-pore domain potassium ion (K2P) channels, are highly expressed in lung tissues, and the activity of these MSCs can be modulated by mechanical forces (e.g., mechanical ventilation) and other stimuli (e.g., LPS, hyperoxia). Dysfunction of MSCs has been found in various types of ALI/ARDS, and MSCs play a key role in regulating alveolar fluid clearance, alveolar epithelial/endothelial barrier function, the inflammatory response and surfactant secretion in ALI/ARDS lungs. Targeting MSCs exerts therapeutic effects in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. In this review, we summarize the structure and functions of several well-recognized MSCs, the role of MSCs in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and recent advances in the pharmacological and molecular modulation of MSCs in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. According to the current literature, targeting MSCs might be a very promising therapeutic approach against ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PI3K/AKT-mediated autophagy inhibition facilitates mast cell activation to enhance severe inflammatory lung injury in influenza A virus- and secondary Staphylococcus aureus-infected mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549394/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality each year globally, and secondary bacterial infection further exacerbates the severity and fatality of the initial viral infection. Mast cells have substantial roles in protecting the respiratory tract mucosa, while their role in viral and bacterial co-infection remains unclear. The present study revealed that secondary Staphylococcus aureus infection significantly aggravated the activation of mast cells during the initial H1N1 infection both in vivo and in vitro, which was closely related to the increased inflammatory lung injury and mortality. Meanwhile, the secondary S. aureus infection suppressed autophagy and promoted inflammatory mediators released by mast cells through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Blocking PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation, could rescue autophagy and inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, based on the influenza A viral and secondary bacterial infected mice model, we showed that the combination of LY294002 and antiviral drug oseltamivir could effectively reduce the inflammatory damage and pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing in lungs, recovering body weight loss and improving the survival rate from the co-infections. In conclusion, secondary bacterial infection can inhibit autophagy and stimulate mast cell activation through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which might explain why secondary bacterial infection would cause severe and fatal consequences following an initial influenza A viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulation of CD18 stability by SIGIRR-modulated ubiquitination: new insights into the relationship between innate immune response and acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36527283/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inappropriate accumulation of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and subsequent excessive production of immune responses play critical roles in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI), but the core negative regulators governing innate signalling in AMs are ill defined. We have previously shown that single immunoglobin IL-1 receptor-related protein (SIGIRR), a negative regulator of IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor signalling, inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in AMs. To address the biological relevance of SIGIRR in vivo, we generated a murine ALI model via intratracheal instillation of LPS. Intriguingly, SIGIRR expression was observed to be decreased in resident and recruited macrophages during ALI. This decrease was associated with parallel induction in CD18 protein levels in LPS-challenged lung tissues. Through intranasal injection of SIGIRR lentiviral particles studies, we showed that the overexpression of SIGIRR attenuated recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils, decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and ameliorated pathological changes in lungs. Whilst exploring the basis for this phenotype, SIGIRR was found to be coexpressed with CD18 in AMs, and SIGIRR potentiated the instability of CD18 protein via enhancement of its ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Conversely, by using CD18-/- mice, we further observed that CD18 deletion completely abolished the therapeutic effects of overexpression of SIGIRR on LPS-induced ALI. Mover, overexpression of CD18 in AMs promoted adhesion to ECM components, enhanced TLR4-mediated inflammasome activation and thereby potentiated IL-1β production. These data collectively identify SIGIRR/CD18 as a key negative regulatory circuit maintaining innate immune homeostasis in AMs along the pathogenesis of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Locally organised and activated Fth1hi neutrophils aggravate inflammation of acute lung injury in an IL-10-dependent manner</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common respiratory critical syndrome with no effective therapeutic intervention. Neutrophils function in the overwhelming inflammatory process of acute lung injury (ALI) caused by ARDS; however, the phenotypic heterogeneity of pulmonary neutrophils in ALI/ARDS remains largely unknown. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify two transcriptionally and functionally heterogeneous neutrophil populations (Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu and Prok2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu) with distinct locations in LPS-induced ALI mouse lungs. Exposure to LPS promotes the Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu subtype, with more inflammatory factors, stronger antioxidant, and decreased apoptosis under the regulation of interleukin-10. Furthermore, prolonged retention of Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu within lung tissue aggravates inflammatory injury throughout the development of ALI/ARDS. Notably, ARDS patients have high ratios of Fth1 to Prok2 expression in pulmonary neutrophils, suggesting that the Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu population may promote the pathological development and provide a marker of poor outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maturation and specialization of group 2 innate lymphoid cells through the lung-gut axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are abundant in mucosal tissues. They serve critical functions in anti-pathogen response and tissue homeostasis. However, the heterogenous composition of ILCs in mucosal sites and their various maturation trajectories are less well known. In this study, we characterize ILC types and functions from both the lung and the small intestine, and identify their tissue-specific markers. We find that ILC2s residing in the lung express CCR2, whereas intestinal ILC2s express CCR4. Through the use of CCR2 and CCR4 reporter mice, we show that ILC2s undergo translocation via the lung-gut axis upon IL-33 treatment. This trajectory of ILC2s is also observed at the postnatal stage. Allergen-induced activation of lung ILC2s affects the homeostasis of gut ILC2s. Together, our findings implicate that ILCs display tissue-specific features in both the lung and gut, and ILC2s mature along the lung-gut axis in particular homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a multiomic cell atlas of human lung development that combines single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing, high-throughput spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell imaging. Coupling single-cell methods with spatial analysis has allowed a comprehensive cellular survey of the epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial, and erythrocyte/leukocyte compartments from 5–22 post-conception weeks. We identify previously uncharacterized cell states in all compartments. These include developmental-specific secretory progenitors and a subtype of neuroendocrine cell related to human small cell lung cancer. Our datasets are available through our web interface (&lt;a href=&#34;https://lungcellatlas.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://lungcellatlas.org&lt;/a&gt;). To illustrate its general utility, we use our cell atlas to generate predictions about cell-cell signaling and transcription factor hierarchies which we rigorously test using organoid models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel FOXF1-Stabilizing Compound TanFe Stimulates Lung Angiogenesis in Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36480964/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36480964/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACDMPV) is linked to heterozygous mutations in the FOXF1 gene, a key transcriptional regulator of pulmonary vascular development. There are no effective treatments for ACDMPV other than lung transplant, and new pharmacological agents activating FOXF1 signaling are urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Identify small molecule compounds that stimulate FOXF1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitation, and the in vitro ubiquitination assay to identify TanFe, a small molecule compound from the nitrile group, which stabilizes the FOXF1 protein in the cell. The efficacy of TanFe was tested in mouse models of ACDMPV and Acute Lung Injury and in human vascular organoids derived from iPSCs of ACDMPV patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and main results:&lt;/em&gt; We identified HECTD1 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in ubiquitination and degradation of the FOXF1 protein. The TanFe compound disrupted FOXF1-HECTD1 protein-protein interactions and decreased ubiquitination of the FOXF1 protein in pulmonary endothelial cells in vitro. TanFe increased protein levels of FOXF1 and its target genes Flk1, Flt1 and Cdh5 in LPS-injured mouse lungs, decreasing endothelial permeability and inhibiting lung inflammation. Treatment of pregnant mice with TanFe increased FOXF1 protein levels in lungs of Foxf1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; embryos, stimulated neonatal lung angiogenesis, and completely prevented the mortality of Foxf1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice after birth. TanFe increased angiogenesis in human vascular organoids derived from iPSCs of ACDMPV patient with FOXF1 deletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; TanFe is a novel activator of FOXF1, providing a new therapeutic candidate for treatment of ACDMPV and other neonatal pulmonary vascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Suppression of PD-L1 release from small extracellular vesicles promotes systemic anti-tumor immunity by targeting ORAI1 calcium channels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36482876/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockade of immune checkpoints as a strategy of cancer cells to overcome the immune response has received ample attention in cancer research recently. In particular, expression of PD-L1 by various cancer cells has become a paradigm in this respect. Delivery of PD-L1 to its site of action occurs either by local diffusion, or else by transport via small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, commonly referred to as exosomes). Many steps of sEVs formation, their packaging with PD-L1 and their release into the extracellular space have been studied in detail. The likely dependence of release on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signaling, however, has received little attention. This is surprising, since the intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-concentration is known as a prominent regulator of many secretory processes. Here, we report on the roles of three Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent proteins in regulating release of PD-L1-containing sEVs, as well as on the growth of tumors in mouse models. We show that sEVs release in cancer cell lines is Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent and the knockdown of the gene coding the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel protein ORAI1 reduces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signals and release of sEVs. Consequently, the T cell response is reinvigorated and tumor progression in mouse models is retarded. Furthermore, analysis of protein expression patterns in samples from human cancer tissue shows that the ORAI1 gene is significantly upregulated. Such upregulation is identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor for survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We show that reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signaling after knockdown of ORAI1 gene also compromises the activity of melanophilin and Synaptotagmin-like protein 2, two proteins, which are important for correct localization of secretory organelles within cancer cells and their transport to sites of exocytosis. Thus, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel ORAI1 and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent proteins of the secretion pathway emerge as important targets for understanding and manipulating immune checkpoint blockade by PD-L1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery of a pyrano[2,3-b]pyridine derivative YX-2102 as a cannabinoid receptor 2 agonist for alleviating lung fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36474298/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pharmacological modulation of cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) is a promising therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Thus, to develop CB2R selective ligands with new chemical space has attracted much research interests. This work aims to discover a novel CB2R agonist from an in-house library, and to evaluate its therapeutic effects on PF model, as well as to disclose the pharmacological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Virtual screening was used to identify the candidate ligand for CB2R from a newly established in-house library. Both in vivo experiments on PF rat model and in vitro experiments on cells were performed to investigate the therapeutic effects of the lead compound and underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A &amp;ldquo;natural product-like&amp;rdquo; pyrano[2,3-b]pyridine derivative, YX-2102 was identified that bound to CB2R with high affinity. Intraperitoneal YX-2102 injections significantly ameliorated lung injury, inflammation and fibrosis in a rat model of PF induced by bleomycin (BLM). On one hand, YX-2102 inhibited inflammatory response at least partially through modulating macrophages polarization thereby exerting protective effects. Whereas, on the other hand, YX-2102 significantly upregulated CB2R expression in alveolar epithelial cells in vivo. Its pretreatment inhibited lung alveolar epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and PF model induced by transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) via a CB2 receptor-dependent pathway. Further studies suggested that the Nrf2-Smad7 pathway might be involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These findings suggest that CB2R is a potential target for PF treatment and YX-2102 is a promising CB2R agonist with new chemical space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lipid-laden lung mesenchymal cells foster breast cancer metastasis via metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells and natural killer cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36476935/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lung mesenchymal cells (MCs) store neutral lipids during breast cancer progression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-1β elicits neutral lipid accumulation in lung MCs to foster metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lipid-laden MCs metabolically reprogram both tumor cells and NK cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting lipid-laden MCs improves the efficacy of NK cell-based immunotherapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the distant organ environment is known to support metastasis of primary tumors, its metabolic roles in this process remain underdetermined. Here, in breast cancer models, we found lung-resident mesenchymal cells (MCs) accumulating neutral lipids at the pre-metastatic stage. This was partially mediated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (HILPDA) that subsequently represses adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) activity in lung MCs. MC-specific ablation of the ATGL or HILPDA genes in mice reinforced and reduced lung metastasis of breast cancer respectively, suggesting a metastasis-promoting effect of lipid-laden MCs. Mechanistically, lipid-laden MCs transported their lipids to tumor cells and natural killer (NK) cells via exosome-like vesicles, leading to heightened tumor cell survival and proliferation and NK cell dysfunction. Blockage of IL-1β, which was effective singly, improved the efficacy of adoptive NK cell immunotherapy in mitigating lung metastasis. Collectively, lung MCs metabolically regulate tumor cells and anti-tumor immunity to facilitate breast cancer lung metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Necroptosis signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome cross-talking in epithelium facilitate Pseudomonas aeruginosa mediated lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36470578/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, although there is an amount of research just focus on ALI/ ARDS pathophysiological analysis, the development of therapies based on specific molecular targets are still lacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-talking between necroptosis and inflammasome in epithelium promotes pathological damage of ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROS inhibitor Mito-TEMPO blocks inflammasome to alleviate inflammation of ALI, which could be a potential therapeutic target for acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced acute lung injury is such a serious risk to public health, but the pathological regulation remains unclear. Here, we reported that PA mediated epithelial necroptosis plays an important role in pathological process. Pharmacological and genomic ablation of necroptosis signaling ameliorate PA mediated ALI and pulmonary inflammation. Our results further proved NLRP3 inflammasome to involve in the process. Mechanism investigation revealed the cross-talking between inflammasome activation and necroptosis that MLKL-dependent necroptosis signaling promotes the change of mitochondrial membrane potential for the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is the important trigger for functional inflammasome activation. Furthermore, antioxidants such as Mito-TEMPO was confirmed to significantly restrain inflammasome activation in epithelium, resulting in a reduction in PA induced pulmonary inflammation. Taken together, our findings revealed that necroptosis-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome in epithelium plays a crucial role in PA mediated injury, which could be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protection of adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells during acute lung injury requires autophagy maintained by mTOR</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells may represent a promising cellular therapy for acute lung injury (ALI); however, the underlying relevant molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) were isolated and characterized by alizarin red staining, oil red staining, and flow cytometry. Lung injury and inflammatory cell infiltration were determined using the Evans blue method, wet/dry weight ratio, and H&amp;amp;E staining. An ELISA was used to detect the concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α. Autophagy was detected with an mRFP-GFP-LC3 dual-fluorescence autophagy indicator system, Western blotting, and electron microscopy. We first demonstrated that ADSCs did alleviate the inflammatory responses and tissue damage in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Next, we further demonstrated in vivo that autophagy plays a key role in the maintenance of ADSC therapeutic efficacy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ADSCs co-cultured with alveolar epithelial cells depend on autophagy for significant anti-inflammatory functions. Moreover, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of autophagy. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of ADSC on ALI, especially on alveolar epithelial cells, is dependent on mTOR-mediated autophagy maintenance. The significance of our study for ALI therapy is discussed with respect to a more complete understanding of the therapeutic strategy paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Highlights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSMA2, a critical component of the 20S and 26S proteasome, is involved in key cellular functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOMAscan analysis identified many lung cell proteins either up- or down-regulated by PSMA2 knockdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSMA2 knockdown affected proteins involved in immune response, cytokine signaling, cellular stress and injury, and cancer responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteasome subunit alpha type-2 (PSMA2) is a critical component of the 20S proteasome, which is the core particle of the 26S proteasome complex and is involved in cellular protein quality control by recognizing and recycling defective proteins. PSMA2 expression dysregulation has been detected in different human diseases and viral infections. No study yet has reported PSMA2 knockdown (KD) effects on the cellular proteome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used SOMAScan, an aptamer-based multiplexed technique, to measure &amp;gt;1300 human proteins to determine the impact of PSMA2 KD on A549 human lung epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; PSMA2 KD resulted in significant dysregulation of 52 cellular proteins involved in different bio-functions, including cellular movement and development, cell death and survival, and cancer. The immune system and signal transduction were the most affected cellular functions. PSMA2 KD caused dysregulation of several signaling pathways involved in immune response, cytokine signaling, organismal growth and development, cellular stress and injury (including autophagy and unfolded protein response), and cancer responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, this study helps us better understand the importance of PSMA2 in different cellular functions, signaling pathways, and human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sacubitril/valsartan alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting GSDMD-dependent macrophage pyroptosis in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36471663/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disorder with intricate pathogenesis. Macrophage pyroptosis reportedly plays a vital role in ALI. Although it has been established that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can reduce sepsis-induced organ injury, the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan (SV) for sepsis has been largely understudied. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of SV in sepsis-induced ALI. Caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) were used to induce polymicrobial sepsis and related ALI. The therapeutic effects of SV in CLP mice were subsequently assessed. Gasdermin D (GSDMD)&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice were used to validate the signalling pathways affected by SV. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and Raw264.7 cells were treated with SV following exposure to lipopolysaccharide and adenosine triphosphate. Finally, the serum obtained from 42 septic patients was used for biochemical analysis. Compared to the other ARBs, SV yielded more pronounced anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, SV decreased mortality rates, significantly reduced lung damage and prevented the inflammatory response in CLP mice. In addition, SV suppressed GSDMD-mediated macrophage pyroptosis in mice. In BMDMs and Raw264.7 cells, the anti-inflammatory and anti-pyroptosis properties of SV were verified. SV treatment effectively inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and prevented macrophage pyroptosis in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that septic individuals had considerably higher serum angiotensin II levels. Overall, we found that SV might prevent ALI in CLP mice by inhibiting GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis of macrophages. Thus, SV might be a viable drug for sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of cannabinoid-2 receptor protects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced acute lung injury and inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463179/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Bacterial pneumonia is a major risk factor for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; (PA), an opportunistic pathogen with an increasing resistance acquired against multiple drugs, is one of the main causative agents of ALI and ARDS in diverse clinical settings. Given the anti-inflammatory role of the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2R), the effect of CB2R activation in the regulation of PA-induced ALI and inflammation was tested in a mouse model as an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In order to activate CB2R, a selective synthetic agonist, JWH133, was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, SR144528 (a selective CB2R antagonist) was administered in combination with JWH133 to test the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effect. PA was administered intratracheally (i.t.) for induction of pneumonia in mice. At 24 h after PA exposure, lung mechanics were measured using the FlexiVent system. The total cell number, protein content, and neutrophil population in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. The bacterial load in the whole lung was also measured. Lung injury was evaluated by histological examination and PA-induced inflammation was assessed by measuring the levels of BALF cytokines and chemokines. Neutrophil activation (examined by immunofluorescence and immunoblot) and PA-induced inflammatory signaling (analyzed by immunoblot) were also studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CB2R activation by JWH133 was found to significantly reduce PA-induced ALI and the bacterial burden. CB2R activation also suppressed the PA-induced increase in immune cell infiltration, neutrophil population, and inflammatory cytokines. These effects were abrogated by a CB2R antagonist, SR144528, further confirming the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effects. CB2R-knock out (CB2RKO) mice had a significantly higher level of PA-induced inflammation as compared to that in WT mice. CB2R activation diminished the excess activation of neutrophils, whereas mice lacking CB2R had elevated neutrophil activation. Pharmacological activation of CB2R significantly reduced the PA-induced NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, whereas CB2KO mice had elevated NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings indicate that CB2R activation ameliorates PA-induced lung injury and inflammation, thus paving the path for new therapeutic avenues against PA pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JMJD3 Is Required for Acute Pancreatitis and Pancreatitis-Associated Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36458991/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be complicated by inflammatory disorders of remote organs, such as lung injury, in which Jumonji domain-containing protein 3 (JMJD3) plays a vital role in proinflammatory responses. Currently, we found that JMJD3 expression was upregulated in the pancreas and lung in an AP male mouse model, which was also confirmed in AP patients. Further experiments revealed that the upregulation of JMJD3 and proinflammatory effects were possibly exerted by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or oxidized-mtDNA from tissue injury caused by AP. The release of mtDNA and oxidized-mtDNA contributed to the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes in lung injury through the stimulator of IFN genes (STING)/TLR9-NF-κB-JMJD3-TNF-α pathway. The inhibition of JMJD3 or utilization of Jmjd3-cKO mice significantly alleviated pulmonary inflammation induced by AP. Blocking mtDNA oxidation or knocking down the TLR9/STING pathway effectively alleviated inflammation. Therefore, inhibition of JMJD3 or STING/TLR9 pathway blockage might be a potential therapeutic strategy to treat AP and the associated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>H3K27 tri-demethylase JMJD3 inhibits macrophage apoptosis by promoting ADORA2A in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36456564/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common critical disease, which is characterized by an uncontrolled, acute inflammatory response, diffuse lung damage and ultimately directly deteriorates into acute respiratory distress syndrome. The number of pro-inflammatory macrophages is related to the severity of ALI. Up-regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophage apoptosis can reduce the pro-inflammatory reactions. Jumonji domain-containing protein D3 (JMJD3)-mediated histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) demethylation may promote the pro-inflammatory response of macrophages under LPS stimulation. However, the mechanism of JMJD3 affecting macrophage apoptosis is still not clear. To explore this gap in knowledge, the ALI mice model with intratracheal administration of LPS and RAW264.7 cells with LPS stimulation were used as in vivo and in vitro experiments. The expression of JMJD3 and H3K27me3 and their cellular localization were analysed in lung tissue. Apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL staining and flow cytometry. Expression of H3K27me3, ADORA2A and C/EBPβ were compared among different treatments and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to investigate the regulatory relationship. Our study showed that JMJD3 expression was upregulated in LPS-induced ALI mice and RAW264.7 cells. JMJD3-indued H3K27me3 demethylation inhibited caspase-3 cleavage by upregulating ADORA2A to decrease LPS-stimulated macrophage apoptosis and promoted the inflammatory reaction. This H3K27me3 demethylation also increased C/EBPβ expression, which may enhance ADORA2A expression further. Besides, inhibiting ADORA2A can also promote LPS-limited macrophage apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of JMJD3 in vivo and in vitro relieved the inhibition of macrophage apoptosis thus leading to the resolution of the inflammation. JMJD3 might inhibit macrophage apoptosis by promoting ADORA2A expression in LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simultaneous isolation of proximal and distal lung progenitor cells from individual mice using a 3D printed guide reduces proximal cell contamination of distal lung epithelial cell isolations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36460000/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3DLD reproducibly separates lung lobes and extrapulmonary airways (bronchi/trachea)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3DLD cell isolation yields consistent isolation of distal epithelial cells (DECs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contamination of proximal cells in classic DEC isolations may alter &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3DLD allows simultaneous isolation of proximal and DECs from single animals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The respiratory epithelium consists of multiple, functionally distinct cell types and is maintained by regionally specific progenitor populations that repair the epithelium following injury. Several &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; methods exist for studying lung epithelial repair using primary murine lung cells, but isolation methods are hampered by a lack of surface markers distinguishing epithelial progenitors along the respiratory epithelium. Here, we developed a 3D printed lobe divider (3DLD) to aid in simultaneous isolation of proximal versus distal lung epithelial progenitors from individual mice that give rise to differentiated epithelia in multiple &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; assays. In contrast to 3DLD-isolated distal progenitor cells, commonly used manual tracheal ligation methods followed by lobe removal resulted in co-isolation of rare proximal cells with distal cells, which altered the transcriptional landscape and size distribution of distal organoids. The 3DLD aids in reproducible isolation of distal versus proximal progenitor populations and minimizes the potential for contaminating populations to confound &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; assays.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFIH1/IRF1/STAT1 promotes sepsis associated inflammatory lung injury via activating macrophage M1 polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36462334/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36462334/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIH1 is activated by infection, which triggers the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor IRF1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRF1 then attaches to the STAT1 promoter region to initiate the transcription of STAT1 and polarization of macrophage M1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRF1 has been identified as the essential molecule that controls the macrophage M1 polarization and the onset of septic ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research has shown that the phenotypic change in macrophages from M0 to M1 is essential for the start of the inflammatory process in septic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Potential treatment targets might be identified with more knowledge of the molecular regulation of M1 macrophages in septic ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-microarray interrelated analysis of high-throughput experiments from ARDS patients and macrophage polarization was conducted to identify the hub genes associated with macrophage M1 polarization and septic ARDS. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Poly (I:C) were utilized to stimulate bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) for M1-polarized macrophage model construction. Knock down of the hub genes on BMDMs via shRNAs was used to screen the genes regulating macrophage M1 polarization in vitro. The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model was constructed in knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice to explore whether the screened genes regulate macrophage M1 polarization in septic ARDS in vivo. ChIP-seq and further experiments on BMDMs were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bioinformatics analysis of gene expression profiles from a clinical cohort of 26 ARDS patients and macrophage polarization found that the 5 hub genes (IFIH1, IRF1, STAT1, IFIT3, GBP1) may have a synergistic effect on macrophage M1 polarization in septic ARDS. Further in vivo investigations indicated that IFIH1, STAT1 and IRF1 contribute to macrophage M1 polarization. The histological evaluation and immunohistochemistry of the lungs from the IRF1-/- and WT mice indicated that knockout of IRF1 markedly alleviated CLP-induced lung injury and M1-polarized infiltration. Moreover, the molecular mechanism investigations indicated that knockdown of IFIH1 markedly promoted IRF1 translocation into the nucleus. Knockout of IRF1 significantly decreases the expression of STAT1. ChIP-seq and PCR further confirmed that IRF1, as a transcription factor of STAT1, binds to the promoter region of STAT1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRF1 was identified as the key molecule that regulates macrophage M1polarization and septic ARDS development in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, as the adaptor in response to infection mimics irritants, IFIH1 promotes IRF1 (transcription factor) translocation into the nucleus to initiate STAT1 transcription.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chlorine (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas is a toxic industrial chemical (TIC) that poses a hazard to human health following accidental and/or intentional (e.g. terrorist) release. By using a murine model of sub-lethal Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposure we have examined the airway hyper responsiveness, cellular infiltrates, transcriptomic and proteomic responses of the lung. In the “crisis” phase at 2 h and 6 h there is a significant decreases in leukocytes within bronchoalveolar lavage fluid accompanied by an upregulation within the proteome of immune pathways ultimately resulting in neutrophil influx at 24 h. A flip towards “repair” in the transcriptome and proteome occurs at 24 h, neutrophil influx and an associated drop in the lung function persisting until 14 d post-exposure and subsequent “recovery” after 28 days. Collectively, this research provides new insights into the mechanisms of damage, early global responses and processes of repair induced in the lung following the inhalation of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory response which causes serious damages to alveolar epithelia and vasculature, and it still remains high lethality and mortality with no effective treatment. Based on the inflammatory homing of platelets and cell membrane cloaking nanotechnology, in this study we developed a biomimetic anti-inflammation nanoparticle delivery system for ALI treatment. PM@Cur-RV NPs were designed by combining the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (NPs) coated with platelet membrane vesicles (PM) for the purpose of highly targeting delivery of curcumin (Cur) and resveratrol (RV) to inflammatory lungs. PM@Cur-RV NPs showed good biocompatibility and biosafety both in vitro and in vivo. Accumulation of NPs into lung tract was observed after inhaled NPs. Remarkably, the inhalation of PM@Cur-RV NPs effectively inhibited lung vascular injury evidenced by the decreased lung vascular permeability, and the reduced proinflammatory cytokine burden in an ALI mouse model. The analysis of infiltrated macrophages in the lungs showed that the Cur-RV-modulated macrophage polarized towards M2 phenotype and the decreased histone lactylation might contribute to their anti-inflammation effects. Together, this work highlights the potential of inhalation of biomimetic nanoparticle delivery of curcumin and resveratrol for the treatment of pulmonary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a prevalent illness in intensive care units. Extracellular vesicles and particles released from activated alveolar macrophages (AMs) assist in ARDS lung injury and the inflammatory process through mechanisms that are unclear. This study investigated the role of AM-derived secretory autophagosomes (SAPs) in lung injury and microRNA (MiR)-199a-3p-regulated inflammation associated with ARDS in vitro and in a murine model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The ARDS model in mouse was established by intratracheal LPS lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. The agomirs or antagomirs of MiR-199a-3p were injected into the caudal vein to figure out whether MiR-199a-3p could influence ARDS inflammation and lung injury, whereas the mimics or inhibitors of MiR-199a-3p, siRNA of Rab8a, or PAK4 inhibitor were transfected or applied to RAW264.7 cells to evaluate the mechanism of SAP release. Culture supernatants of RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice were collected for the isolation of SAPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that MiR-199a-3p was over-expressed in the lungs of ARDS mice. The MiR-199a-3p antagomir alleviated, whereas the MiR-199a-3p agomir exacerbated LPS-induced inflammation in mice by promoting AM-derived SAP secretion. In addition, MiR-199a-3p over-expression exacerbated LPS-induced ARDS via activating Rab8a, and Rab8a silencing significantly suppressed the promoting influence of the MiR-199a-3p mimic on SAP secretion. Furthermore, MiR-199a-3p mimic activated Rab8a by directly inhibiting PAK4 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The novel finding of this study is that MiR-199a-3p participated in the regulation of SAP secretion and the inflammatory process via targeting of PAK4/Rab8a, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for ARDS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messenger RNA has now been used to vaccinate millions of people. However, the diversity of pulmonary pathologies, including infections, genetic disorders, asthma and others, reveals the lung as an important organ to directly target for future RNA therapeutics and preventatives. Here we report the screening of 166 polymeric nanoparticle formulations for functional delivery to the lungs, obtained from a combinatorial synthesis approach combined with a low-dead-volume nose-only inhalation system for mice. We identify P76, a poly-β-amino-thio-ester polymer, that exhibits increased expression over formulations lacking the thiol component, delivery to different animal species with varying RNA cargos and low toxicity. P76 allows for dose sparing when delivering an mRNA-expressed Cas13a-mediated treatment in a SARS-CoV-2 challenge model, resulting in similar efficacy to a 20-fold higher dose of a neutralizing antibody. Overall, the combinatorial synthesis approach allowed for the discovery of promising polymeric formulations for future RNA pharmaceutical development for the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attenuation of the Severity of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by Pomiferin through Blocking Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in an AKT/Foxo1 Pathway-Dependent Manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36471865/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) gives rise to uncontrolled inflammatory response and oxidative stress, causing very high mortality globally. Pomiferin is a kind of prenylated isoflavonoid extracted from &lt;em&gt;Maclura pomifera&lt;/em&gt;, owning anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the functions and possible mechanisms of pomiferin in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ARDS remain unknown. C57BL/6 mice were injected with LPS (5 mg/kg) intratracheally to induce an in vivo ARDS model while RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) to induce an in vitro model. Our data demonstrated that pomiferin (20 mg/kg) significantly improved pulmonary function and lung pathological injury in mice with ARDS, apart from increasing survival rate. Meanwhile, pomiferin treatment also inhibited LPS-induced inflammation as well as oxidative stress in lung tissues. LPS stimulation significantly activated AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway in lung tissues, which could be reversed after pomiferin treatment. In vitro experiments further showed that 10, 20, and 50 μM of pomiferin could enhance cell viability of RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with LPS. What is more, 3-deoxysappanchalcone (3-DE), one AKT agonist, was used to active AKT in RAW264.7 macrophages. The results further showed that 3-DE could abolish pomiferin-elicited protection in LPS-treated RAW264.7 macrophages, evidenced by activated inflammation and oxidative stress. Taken together, our study showed that pomiferin could exert an ARDS-protective effect by blocking the AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway to inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative injury, which may serve as a potential candidate for the treatment of ARDS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine is a biomarker and potential therapeutic target for community-acquired pneumonia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36459717/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lysophosphatidylcholine decreases in CAP patients during the acute phase of the disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPC14:0 demonstrates excellent diagnostic performance in predicting CAP disease severity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPC14:0 exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects in vivo and in vitro experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no gold standard for evaluating the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and it is still based on a score. This study aimed to use the metabolomics method to find promised biomarkers in assessing disease severity and potential therapeutic targets for CAP. The result found that the metabolites in the plasma samples of CAP patients had significantly different between the acute phase and the remission phase, especially lysophosphatidylcholine (LPCs) in glycerophospholipids, whose levels are negatively linked to the severity of the disease. Subsequently, the two key metabolites of myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC 14:0) and LPC 16:1 were screened. We analyzed the predictive performance of the two metabolites using Spearman-related analysis and ROC curves, and LPC14:0 showed more satisfactory diagnostic performance than LPC16:1. Then we explored the protective role and mechanism of LPC 14:0 in animal and cell models. The results showed that LPC 14:0 could inhibit the LPS-induced secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, lower the ROS and MDA levels, and decreased the depletion of SOD and GSH, thereby reducing lung tissue and cell damage, such as down-regulating the protein level in BALF, lung W/D ratio, MPO activity, and apoptosis. We found that LPC 14:0 inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress, and the above protection was achieved by inhibiting LPS-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. LPC 14:0 may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting the severity of CAP. In addition, our exploration of the role of LPC 14:0 in animal and cellular models has reinforced its promise as a therapeutic target to improve the clinical efficacy for CAP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chronic exposure to carbon black ultrafine particles reprograms macrophage metabolism and accelerates lung cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36383649/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic exposure to airborne carbon black ultrafine (nCB) particles generated from incomplete combustion of organic matter drives IL-17A–dependent emphysema. However, whether and how they alter the immune responses to lung cancer remains unknown. Here, we show that exposure to nCB particles increased PD-L1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; PD-L2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD206&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antigen-presenting cells (APCs), exhausted T cells, and Treg cells. Lung macrophages that harbored nCB particles showed selective mitochondrial structure damage and decreased oxidative respiration. Lung macrophages sustained the HIF1α axis that increased glycolysis and lactate production, culminating in an immunosuppressive microenvironment in multiple mouse models of non–small cell lung cancers. Adoptive transfer of lung APCs from nCB-exposed wild type to susceptible mice increased tumor incidence and caused early metastasis. Our findings show that nCB exposure metabolically rewires lung macrophages to promote immunosuppression and accelerates the development of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating hyaluronic acid signature in CAP and ARDS - the role of pneumolysin in hyaluronic acid shedding</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36456058/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soluble HA levels are elevated in CAP and ARDS plasma and are associated with an increase in 28-day mortality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soluble HA levels correlate with disease severity and markers of inflammation, endothelial cell activation, and basement membrane destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small and large HA fragments are detected in plasma of most severe CAP or ARDS patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pneumolysin induces HA release from human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pneumolysin-induced HA shedding is dependent on reactive oxygen species production and is not associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shedding of hyaluronan (HA), the component of endothelial cell (EC) glycocalyx, has been associated with acute lung injury. HA degradation allows plasma proteins and fluid to penetrate across the vascular wall leading to lung edema formation and leukocyte recruitment. Here, we analyzed sHA levels and size in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), correlated them to disease severity, and evaluated the impact of pneumolysin (PLY), the Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.p.) exotoxin, on HA shedding from human pulmonary microvascular EC (HPMVEC). sHA levels were elevated in CAP and ARDS and correlated with the CRB65 severity score and with markers of inflammation (interleukin-6), EC activation (E-selectin), and basement membrane destruction (collagen IV). Furthermore, sHA levels were associated with an increase in 28-day mortality. Small and large sHA fragments were detected in plasma of most severe CAP or ARDS patients, and the presence of large sHA fragments was accompanied by the elevated levels of circulating collagen IV. In vitro, PLY induced sHA release from HPMVEC. This effect was dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and was not associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction. Conversely, HA shedding was impaired following HPMVEC infection with a S.p. PLY-deficient mutant. Our study identifies association between the severity of CAP and ARDS and the levels and size of sHA in plasma. It links sHA levels with, inflammation, EC activation status and basement membrane disassembly in ARDS and provides insights into the mechanism of HA shedding during infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by molecular heterogeneity with diverse immune cell infiltration patterns, which has been linked to therapy sensitivity and resistance. However, full understanding of how immune cell phenotypes vary across different patient subgroups is lacking. Here, we dissect the NSCLC tumor microenvironment at high resolution by integrating 1,283,972 single cells from 556 samples and 318 patients across 29 datasets, including our dataset capturing cells with low mRNA content. We stratify patients into immune-deserted, B cell, T cell, and myeloid cell subtypes. Using bulk samples with genomic and clinical information, we identify cellular components associated with tumor histology and genotypes. We then focus on the analysis of tissue-resident neutrophils (TRNs) and uncover distinct subpopulations that acquire new functional properties in the tissue microenvironment, providing evidence for the plasticity of TRNs. Finally, we show that a TRN-derived gene signature is associated with anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) treatment failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bats are reservoir hosts of many zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential. We utilized single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the immune response in bat lungs upon &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; infection with a double-stranded RNA virus, &lt;em&gt;Pteropine orthoreovirus&lt;/em&gt; PRV3M. Bat neutrophils were distinguished by high basal &lt;em&gt;IDO1&lt;/em&gt; expression. NK cells and T cells were the most abundant immune cells in lung tissue. Three distinct CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; effector T cell populations could be delineated by differential expression of &lt;em&gt;KLRB1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;GFRA2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DPP4&lt;/em&gt;. Select NK and T clusters increased expression of genes involved in T cell activation and effector function early after viral infection. Alveolar macrophages and classical monocytes drove antiviral interferon signaling. Infection expanded a &lt;em&gt;CSF1R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; population expressing collagen-like genes, which became the predominant myeloid cell type post-infection. This work uncovers features relevant to viral disease tolerance in bats, lays a foundation for future experimental work, and serves as a resource for comparative immunology studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblast growth factor 10 protects against particulate matter-induced lung injury by inhibiting oxidative stress-mediated pyroptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulate matter (PM) is a major environmental contaminant that causes and worsens respiratory diseases. Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10), a paracrine fibroblast growth factor that specifically stimulates repair and regeneration after injury, has been shown to protect against PM-induced lung injury. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, the protective effects of FGF10 were investigated using a PM-induced lung injury mouse model in vivo and BEAS-2B cells in vitro. According to the findings, FGF10 treatment alleviated PM-induced oxidative damage and pyroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, FGF10 activated antioxidative Nrf2 signaling. Inhibition of PI3K signaling with LY294002 or Nrf2 signaling with ML385 revealed that FGF10-mediated lung protection was mediated by the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. These results collectively indicate that FGF10 inhibits oxidative stress-mediated pyroptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway, suggesting a possible therapy for PM-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circadian clock-based therapeutics in chronic pulmonary diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circadian clock is the biochemical oscillator that orchestrates the observable circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior. Disruption of the circadian clock in the lungs during chronic pulmonary diseases is considered one of the key etiological risk factors that drive pathobiology. Preclinical studies support that pharmacological manipulation of the circadian clock is a conceivable approach for the development of novel clock-based therapeutics. Despite recent advances, no effort has been undertaken to integrate novel findings for the treatment and management of chronic lung diseases. We, therefore, recognize the need to discuss the candidate clock genes that can be potentially targeted for therapeutic intervention. Here, we aim to create the first roadmap that will advance the development of circadian- clock-based therapeutics that may provide better outcomes in treating chronic pulmonary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We engineered an ultrasensitive reporter of p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a&lt;/sup&gt;, a biomarker of cellular senescence. Our reporter detected p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a&lt;/sup&gt;-expressing fibroblasts with certain senescent characteristics that appeared shortly after birth in the basement membrane adjacent to epithelial stem cells in the lung. Furthermore, these p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a+&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts had enhanced capacity to sense tissue inflammation and respond through their increased secretory capacity to promote epithelial regeneration. In addition, p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a&lt;/sup&gt; expression was required in fibroblasts to enhance epithelial regeneration. This study highlights a role for p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a+&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts as tissue-resident sentinels in the stem cell niche that monitor barrier integrity and rapidly respond to inflammation to promote tissue regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The human lung microbiome—A hidden link between microbes and human health and diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/imt2.33/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once thought to be sterile, the human lung is now well recognized to harbor a consortium of microorganisms collectively known as the lung microbiome. The lung microbiome is altered in an array of lung diseases, including chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and bronchiectasis, acute lung diseases caused by pneumonia, sepsis, and COVID-19, and other lung complications such as those related to lung transplantation, lung cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus. The effects of lung microbiome in modulating host immunity and inflammation in the lung and distal organs are being elucidated. However, the precise mechanism by which members of microbiota produce structural ligands that interact with host genes and pathways remains largely uncharacterized. Multiple unique challenges, both technically and biologically, exist in the field of lung microbiome, necessitating the development of tailored experimental and analytical approaches to overcome the bottlenecks. In this review, we first provide an overview of the principles and methodologies in studying the lung microbiome. We next review current knowledge of the roles of lung microbiome in human diseases, highlighting mechanistic insights. We finally discuss critical challenges in the field and share our thoughts on broad topics for future investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circadian molecular clock disruption in chronic pulmonary diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circadian clock is the biochemical oscillator with a near 24-h period that is responsible for generating the circadian rhythms in peripheral organs including the lung. Mounting evidence suggests that circadian clock disruption during chronic lung diseases plays an essential role in augmented oxidative stress, inflammatory response, metabolic imbalances, hypoxia/hyperoxia, mucus secretion, dysregulated autophagy, and alters pulmonary function. Here, we review circadian clock disruption and discuss candidate clock genes that are altered at the transcriptional or translational level in chronic pulmonary diseases. This review aims to provide the current knowledge and understanding of the circadian molecular clock disruption in chronic pulmonary diseases which will further advance the development of novel clock-based therapeutics in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KMT2C deficiency promotes small cell lung cancer metastasis through DNMT3A-mediated epigenetic reprogramming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is notorious for its early and frequent metastases, which contribute to it as a recalcitrant malignancy. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying SCLC metastasis, we generated SCLC mouse models with orthotopically transplanted genome-edited lung organoids and performed multiomics analyses. We found that a deficiency of KMT2C, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase frequently mutated in extensive-stage SCLC, promoted multiple-organ metastases in mice. Metastatic and KMT2C-deficient SCLC displayed both histone and DNA hypomethylation. Mechanistically, KMT2C directly regulated the expression of DNMT3A, a de novo DNA methyltransferase, through histone methylation. Forced DNMT3A expression restrained metastasis of KMT2C-deficient SCLC through repressing metastasis-promoting MEIS/HOX genes. Further, S-(5′-adenosyl)-L-methionine, the common cofactor of histone and DNA methyltransferases, inhibited SCLC metastasis. Thus, our study revealed a concerted epigenetic reprogramming of KMT2C- and DNMT3A-mediated histone and DNA hypomethylation underlying SCLC metastasis, which suggested a potential epigenetic therapeutic vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neuropilin-1 mediates lung tissue-specific control of ILC2 function in type 2 immunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are highly heterogeneous tissue-resident lymphocytes that regulate inflammation and tissue homeostasis in health and disease. However, how these cells integrate into the tissue microenvironment to perform tissue-specific functions is unclear. Here, we show neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), which is induced postnatally and sustained by lung-derived transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1), is a tissue-specific marker of lung ILC2s. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of Nrp1 suppresses IL-5 and IL-13 production by ILC2s and protects mice from the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, TGFβ1-Nrp1 signaling enhances ILC2 function and type 2 immunity by upregulating IL-33 receptor ST2 expression. These findings identify Nrp1 as a tissue-specific regulator of lung-resident ILC2s and highlight Nrp1 as a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coal dust exposure triggers heterogeneity of transcriptional profiles in mouse pneumoconiosis and Vitamin D remedies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35057792/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35057792/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Coal dust particles (CDP), an inevitable by-product of coal mining for the environment, mainly causes coal workers&amp;rsquo; pneumoconiosis (CWP). Long-term exposure to coal dust leads to a complex alternation of biological processes during regeneration and repair in the healing lung. However, the cellular and complete molecular changes associated with pulmonary homeostasis caused by respiratory coal dust particles remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; This study mainly investigated the pulmonary toxicity of respirable-sized CDP in mice using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing. CDP (&amp;lt; 5 μm) collected from the coal mine was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Mass Spectrometer. In addition, western blotting, Elisa, QPCR was used to detect gene expression at mRNA or protein levels. Pathological analysis including HE staining, Masson staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to characterize the structure and functional alternation in the pneumoconiosis mouse and verify the reliability of single-cell sequencing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; SEM image and Mass Spectrometer analysis showed that coal dust particles generated during coal mine production have been crushed and screened with a diameter of less than 5 µm and contained less than 10% silica. Alveolar structure and pulmonary microenvironment were destroyed, inflammatory and death (apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis) pathways were activated, leading to pneumoconiosis in post 9 months coal dust stimulation. A distinct abnormally increased alveolar type 2 epithelial cell (AT2) were classified with a highly active state but reduced the antimicrobial-related protein expression of LYZ and Chia1 after CDP exposure. Beclin1, LC3B, LAMP2, TGF-ß, and MLPH were up-regulated induced by CDP, promoting autophagy and pulmonary fibrosis. A new subset of macrophages with M2-type polarization double expressed MLPH + /CD206 + was found in mice having pneumoconiosis but markedly decreased after the Vitamin D treatment. Activated MLPH + /CD206 + M2 macrophages secreted TGF-β1 and are sensitive to Vitamin D treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This is the first study to reconstruct the pathologic progression and transcriptome pattern of coal pneumoconiosis in mice. Coal dust had obvious toxic effects on lung epithelial cells and macrophages and eventually induced pulmonary fibrosis. CDP-induced M2-type macrophages could be inhibited by VD, which may be related to the alleviation of the pulmonary fibrosis process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RBMS1 regulates lung cancer ferroptosis through translational control of SLC7A11</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent nonapoptotic cell death, is a highly regulated tumor suppressing process. However, functions and mechanisms of RNA-binding proteins in regulation of evasion of ferroptosis during lung cancer progression are still largely unknown. Here, we report that the RNA-binding protein RBMS1 participates in lung cancer development via mediating ferroptosis evasion. Through an shRNA-mediated systematic screen, we discovered that RBMS1 is a key ferroptosis regulator. Clinically, RBMS1 was elevated in lung cancer and its high expression was associated with reduced patient survival. Conversely, depletion of RBMS1 inhibited lung cancer progression both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, RBMS1 interacted with the translation initiation factor eIF3d directly to bridge the 3&amp;rsquo;- and 5&amp;rsquo;-UTR of SLC7A11. RBMS1 ablation inhibited the translation of SLC7A11, reduced SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake, and promoted ferroptosis. In a drug screen that targeted RBMS1, we further uncovered that nortriptyline hydrochloride decreased the level of RBMS1, thereby promoting ferroptosis. Importantly, RBMS1 depletion or inhibition by nortriptyline hydrochloride sensitized radioresistant lung cancer cells to radiotherapy. Our findings established RBMS1 as a translational regulator of ferroptosis and a prognostic factor with therapeutic potential and clinical value.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cis-acting lnc-Cxcl2 restrains neutrophil-mediated lung inflammation by inhibiting epithelial cell CXCL2 expression in virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34607953/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemokine production by epithelial cells is important for neutrophil recruitment during viral infection, the appropriate regulation of which is critical for restraining inflammation and attenuating subsequent tissue damage. Epithelial cell expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), RNA-binding proteins, and their functional interactions during viral infection and inflammation remain to be fully understood. Here, we identified an inducible lncRNA in the &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; gene locus, lnc-Cxcl2, which could selectively inhibit &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; expression in mouse lung epithelial cells but not in macrophages. lnc-Cxcl2-deficient mice exhibited increased &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; expression, enhanced neutrophils recruitment, and more severe inflammation in the lung after influenza virus infection. Mechanistically, nucleus-localized lnc-Cxcl2 bound to &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; promoter, recruited a ribonucleoprotein La, which inhibited the chromatin accessibility of chemokine promoters, and consequently inhibited &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; transcription in cis However, unlike mouse lnc-Cxcl2, human lnc-CXCL2-4-1 inhibited multiple immune cytokine expressions including chemokines in human lung epithelial cells. Together, our results demonstrate a self-protecting mechanism within epithelial cells to restrain chemokine and neutrophil-mediated inflammation, providing clues for better understanding chemokine regulation and epithelial cell function in lung viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Biosafety Level 2 Mouse Model for Studying Betacoronavirus-Induced Acute Lung Damage and Systemic Manifestations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34495692/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of life-threatening zoonotic diseases caused by betacoronaviruses, including the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, has highlighted the need for developing preclinical models mirroring respiratory and systemic pathophysiological manifestations seen in infected humans. Here, we showed that C57BL/6J wild-type mice intranasally inoculated with the murine betacoronavirus murine hepatitis coronavirus 3 (MHV-3) develop a robust inflammatory response leading to acute lung injuries, including alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and fibrin thrombi. Although such histopathological changes seemed to resolve as the infection advanced, they efficiently impaired respiratory function, as the infected mice displayed restricted lung distention and increased respiratory frequency and ventilation. Following respiratory manifestation, the MHV-3 infection became systemic, and a high virus burden could be detected in multiple organs along with morphological changes. The systemic manifestation of MHV-3 infection was also marked by a sharp drop in the number of circulating platelets and lymphocytes, besides the augmented concentration of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-12, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), thereby mirroring some clinical features observed in moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. Importantly, both respiratory and systemic changes triggered by MHV-3 infection were greatly prevented by blocking TNF signaling, either via genetic or pharmacologic approaches. In line with this, TNF blockage also diminished the infection-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines and virus replication of human epithelial lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Collectively, results show that MHV-3 respiratory infection leads to a large range of clinical manifestations in mice and may constitute an attractive, lower-cost, biosafety level 2 (BSL2) in vivo platform for evaluating the respiratory and multiorgan involvement of betacoronavirus infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouse models have long been used as valuable in vivo platforms to investigate the pathogenesis of viral infections and effective countermeasures. The natural resistance of mice to the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has launched a race toward the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection in other animals (e.g., hamsters, cats, ferrets, bats, and monkeys), as well as adaptation of the mouse model, by modifying either the host or the virus. In the present study, we utilized a natural pathogen of mice, MHV, as a prototype to model betacoronavirus-induced acute lung injure and multiorgan involvement under biosafety level 2 conditions. We showed that C57BL/6J mice intranasally inoculated with MHV-3 develops severe disease, which includes acute lung damage and respiratory distress that precede systemic inflammation and death. Accordingly, the proposed animal model may provide a useful tool for studies regarding betacoronavirus respiratory infection and related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-1β augments TGF-β inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition of epithelial cells and associates with poor pulmonary function improvement in neutrophilic asthmatics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34344357/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophilic asthmatics (NA) have less response to inhaled corticosteroids. We aimed to find out the predictor of treatment response in NA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthmatics (n = 115) and healthy controls (n = 28) underwent clinical assessment during 6-month follow-up with standardized therapy. Asthmatics were categorized by sputum differential cell count. The mRNA expressions were measured by RT-qPCR for sputum cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-27, FOXP3, IL-17A, and IL-5). The protein of IL-1β in sputum supernatant was detected by ELISA. Reticular basement membranes (RBM) were measured in the biopsy samples. The role and signaling pathways of IL-1β mediating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process were explored through A549 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NA had increased baseline sputum cell IL-1β expression compared to eosinophilic asthmatics (EA). After follow-up, NA had less improvement in FEV1 compared to EA. For all asthmatics, sputum IL-1β mRNA was positively correlated with protein expression. Sputum IL-1β mRNA and protein levels were negatively correlated to FEV1 improvement. After subgrouping, the correlation between IL-1β mRNA and FEV1 improvement was significant in NA but not in EA. Thickness of RBM in asthmatics was greater than that of healthy controls and positively correlated with neutrophil percentage in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In vitro experiments, the process of IL-1β augmenting TGF-β1-induced EMT cannot be abrogated by glucocorticoid or montelukast sodium, but can be reversed by MAPK inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IL-1β level in baseline sputum predicts the poor lung function improvement in NA. The potential mechanism may be related to IL-1β augmenting TGF-β1-induced steroid-resistant EMT through MAPK signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammatory responses induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with severe symptoms of COVID-19. Inflammasomes activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are also associated with COVID-19 severity. Here, we show a distinct mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation to induce hyperinflammation. N protein facilitates maturation of proinflammatory cytokines and induces proinflammatory responses in cultured cells and mice. Mechanistically, N protein interacts directly with NLRP3 protein, promotes the binding of NLRP3 with ASC, and facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. More importantly, N protein aggravates lung injury, accelerates death in sepsis and acute inflammation mouse models, and promotes IL-1β and IL-6 activation in mice. Notably, N-induced lung injury and cytokine production are blocked by MCC950 (a specific inhibitor of NLRP3) and Ac-YVAD-cmk (an inhibitor of caspase-1). Therefore, this study reveals a distinct mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and induces excessive inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Age-dependent alveolar epithelial plasticity orchestrates lung homeostasis and regeneration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regeneration of the architecturally complex alveolar niche of the lung requires precise temporal and spatial control of epithelial cell behavior. Injury can lead to a permanent reduction in gas exchange surface area and respiratory function. Using mouse models, we show that alveolar type 1 (AT1) cell plasticity is a major and unappreciated mechanism that drives regeneration, beginning in the early postnatal period during alveolar maturation. Upon acute neonatal lung injury, AT1 cells reprogram into alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, promoting alveolar regeneration. In contrast, the ability of AT2 cells to regenerate AT1 cells is restricted to the mature lung. Unbiased genomic assessment reveals that this previously unappreciated level of plasticity is governed by the preferential activity of Hippo signaling in the AT1 cell lineage. Thus, cellular plasticity is a temporally acquired trait of the alveolar epithelium and presents an alternative mode of tissue regeneration in the postnatal lung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Temporal landscape of human gut RNA and DNA virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33853691/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the enveloped RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal samples, and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We enrolled 98 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity (3 asymptomatic, 53 mild, 34 moderate, 5 severe, 3 critical) and 78 non-COVID-19 controls matched for gender and co-morbidities. All subjects had fecal specimens sampled at inclusion. Blood specimens were collected for COVID-19 patients at admission to test for inflammatory markers and white cell counts. Among COVID-19 cases, 37 (38%) patients had serial fecal samples collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until after discharge. Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, we sequenced and profiled the fecal RNA and DNA virome. We investigated alterations and longitudinal dynamics of the gut virome in association with disease severity and blood parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Patients with COVID-19 showed underrepresentation of Pepper mild mottle virus (RNA virus) and multiple bacteriophage lineages (DNA viruses) and enrichment of environment-derived eukaryotic DNA viruses in fecal samples, compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Such gut virome alterations persisted up to 30 days after disease resolution. Fecal virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection harbored more stress-, inflammation-, and virulence-associated gene encoding capacities including those pertaining to bacteriophage integration, DNA repair, and metabolism and virulence associated with their bacterial host. Baseline fecal abundance of 10 virus species (1 RNA virus, pepper chlorotic spot virus, and 9 DNA virus species) inversely correlated with disease COVID-19 severity. These viruses inversely correlated with blood levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, white cells, and neutrophils. Among the 10 COVID-19 severity-associated DNA virus species, 4 showed inverse correlation with age; 5 showed persistent lower abundance both during disease course and after disease resolution relative to non-COVID-19 subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Both enteric RNA and DNA virome in COVID-19 patients were different from non-COVID-19 subjects, which persisted after disease resolution of COVID-19. Gut virome may calibrate host immunity and regulate severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observation that gut viruses inversely correlated with both severity of COVID-19 and host age may partly explain that older subjects are prone to severe and worse COVID-19 outcomes. Altogether, our data highlight the importance of human gut virome in severity and potentially therapeutics of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung virome: New potential biomarkers for asthma severity and exacerbation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33757721/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Although some respiratory virus infections are known to contribute to the development and exacerbation of asthma, commensal viromes in airway have not been extensively studied due to technical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; This study investigated the characteristics of the virome in asthmatic airways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Both the bacteriome and virome profiles in sputum from 12 healthy individuals, 15 patients with nonsevere asthma, and 15 patients with severe asthma were analyzed and assessed for the association with clinical characteristics such as severity, exacerbation, Asthma Control Test (ACT), and lung function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; While analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA bacteriome in the airway showed no differences, clear contrasts in the diversity and composition of airway viromes were observed between healthy controls and patients with asthma. Herpesviruses were the most abundant type of virus in the asthma group (44.6 ± 4.6%), mainly with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and EBV accounting for 24.5 ± 3.3% and 16.9 ± 3.5%, respectively, in contrast to those in the healthy controls (5.4 ± 2.5% and 7.1 ± 3.0%, respectively). CMV and EBV were more abundant in patients with asthma who experienced exacerbation, and their abundance showed correlation with more severe asthma, lower ACT score, and lower lung function. On the contrary, bacteriophage that is abundant in healthy controls was severely reduced in patients with asthma in the order of nonsevere and severe asthma and presented significant positive correlation with ACT and FEV1/forced vital capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Lung viromes, especially, CMV, EBV, and bacteriophage may be potential biomarkers of asthma severity and exacerbation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrated gut virome and bacteriome dynamics in COVID-19 patients</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33678150/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the current global pandemic of COVID-19; this virus infects multiple organs, such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. The microbiome in these organs, including the bacteriome and virome, responds to infection and might also influence disease progression and treatment outcome. In a cohort of 13 COVID-19 patients in Beijing, China, we observed that the gut virome and bacteriome in the COVID-19 patients were notably different from those of five healthy controls. We identified a bacterial dysbiosis signature by observing reduced diversity and viral shifts in patients, and among the patients, the bacterial/viral compositions were different between patients of different severities, although these differences are not entirely distinguishable from the effect of antibiotics. Severe cases of COVID-19 exhibited a greater abundance of opportunistic pathogens but were depleted for butyrate-producing groups of bacteria compared with mild to moderate cases. We replicated our findings in a mouse COVID-19 model, confirmed virome differences and bacteriome dysbiosis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and observed that immune/infection-related genes were differentially expressed in gut epithelial cells during infection, possibly explaining the virome and bacteriome dynamics. Our results suggest that the components of the microbiome, including the bacteriome and virome, are affected by SARS-CoV-2 infections, while their compositional signatures could reflect or even contribute to disease severity and recovery processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SRSF1 inhibits autophagy through regulating Bcl-x splicing and interacting with PIK3C3 in lung cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33664238/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative splicing is a critical process to generate protein diversity. However, whether and how alternative splicing regulates autophagy remains largely elusive. Here we systematically identify the splicing factor SRSF1 as an autophagy suppressor. Specifically, SRSF1 inhibits autophagosome formation by reducing the accumulation of LC3-II and numbers of autophagosomes in different cell lines. Mechanistically, SRSF1 promotes the splicing of the long isoform of Bcl-x that interacts with Beclin1, thereby dissociating the Beclin1-PIK3C3 complex. In addition, SRSF1 also directly interacts with PIK3C3 to disrupt the interaction between Beclin1 and PIK3C3. Consequently, the decrease of SRSF1 stabilizes the Beclin1 and PIK3C3 complex and activates autophagy. Interestingly, SRSF1 can be degraded by starvation- and oxidative stresses-induced autophagy through interacting with LC3-II, whereas reduced SRSF1 further promotes autophagy. This positive feedback is critical to inhibiting Gefitinib-resistant cancer cell progression both in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, the expression level of SRSF1 is inversely correlated to LC3 level in clinical cancer samples. Our study not only provides mechanistic insights of alternative splicing in autophagy regulation but also discovers a new regulatory role of SRSF1 in tumorigenesis, thereby offering a novel avenue for potential cancer therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung Myofibroblasts Promote Macrophage Profibrotic Activity through Lactate-induced Histone Lactylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33074715/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augmented glycolysis due to metabolic reprogramming in lung myofibroblasts is critical to their profibrotic phenotype. The primary glycolysis byproduct, lactate, is also secreted into the extracellular milieu, together with which myofibroblasts and macrophages form a spatially restricted site usually described as fibrotic niche. Therefore, we hypothesized that myofibroblast glycolysis might have a non-cell autonomous effect through lactate regulating the pathogenic phenotype of alveolar macrophages. Here, we demonstrated that there was a markedly increased lactate in the conditioned media of TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-β1)-induced lung myofibroblasts and in the BAL fluids (BALFs) from mice with TGF-β1- or bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Importantly, the media and BALFs promoted profibrotic mediator expression in macrophages. Mechanistically, lactate induced histone lactylation in the promoters of the profibrotic genes in macrophages, consistent with the upregulation of this epigenetic modification in these cells in the fibrotic lungs. The lactate inductions of the histone lactylation and profibrotic gene expression were mediated by p300, as evidenced by their diminished concentrations in p300-knockdown macrophages. Collectively, our study establishes that in addition to protein, lipid, and nucleic acid molecules, a metabolite can also mediate intercellular regulations in the setting of lung fibrosis. Our findings shed new light on the mechanism underlying the key contribution of myofibroblast glycolysis to the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification and Validation of Autophagy-Related Genes in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33469280/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Autophagy plays essential roles in the development of COPD. We aim to identify and validate the potential autophagy-related genes of COPD through bioinformatics analysis and experiment validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The mRNA expression profile dataset GSE38974 was obtained from GEO database. The potential differentially expressed autophagy-related genes of COPD were screened by R software. Then, protein–protein interactions (PPI), correlation analysis, gene-ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were applied for the differentially expressed autophagy-related genes. Finally, RNA expression of top five differentially expressed autophagy-related genes was validated in blood samples from COPD patients and healthy controls by qRT-PCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 40 differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (14 up-regulated genes and 26 down-regulated genes) were identified between 23 COPD patients and 9 healthy controls. The PPI results demonstrated that these autophagy-related genes interacted with each other. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed autophagy-related genes indicated several enriched terms related to autophagy and mitophagy. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CDKN1A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BAG3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ERBB2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ATG16L1&lt;/em&gt; in COPD patients and healthy controls were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis results from mRNA microarray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We identified 40 potential autophagy-related genes of COPD through bioinformatics analysis. &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CDKN1A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BAG3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ERBB2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ATG16L1&lt;/em&gt; may affect the development of COPD by regulating autophagy. These results may expand our understanding of COPD and might be useful in the treatment of COPD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although single-cell RNA sequencing studies have begun to provide compendia of cell expression profiles, it has been difficult to systematically identify and localize all molecular cell types in individual organs to create a full molecular cell atlas. Here, using droplet- and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing of approximately 75,000 human cells across all lung tissue compartments and circulating blood, combined with a multi-pronged cell annotation approach, we create an extensive cell atlas of the human lung. We define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 out of 45 previously known cell types and 14 previously unknown ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas identifies the biochemical functions of lung cells and the transcription factors and markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signalling interactions and immune cell homing; and identifies cell types that are directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory viruses. By comparing human and mouse data, we identified 17 molecular cell types that have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others with substantially altered expression profiles, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell-type-specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types. This atlas provides the molecular foundation for investigating how lung cell identities, functions and interactions are achieved in development and tissue engineering and altered in disease and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systemic inflammatory processes, including alveolar injury, cytokine induction, and neutrophil accumulation, play key roles in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury (ALI). The immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can contribute to the treatment of inflammatory disorders. In previous studies, the focus was on innate immune cells and the effects of MSCs on ALI through CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells remain unclear. In the present study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce ALI in mice. ALI mice were treated with MSCs via intratracheal instillation. Survival rate, histopathological changes, protein levels, total cell count, cytokine levels, and chemokine levels in alveolar lavage fluid were used to determine the efficacy of MSCs. Mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were used to characterize the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the lungs. Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are prevalent in normal mice, whereas a specialized effector phenotype expressing a high level of Ly6C is predominant in advanced disease. MSCs significantly mitigated ALI and improved survival. MSCs decreased the infiltration of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, especially Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells into the lungs. Mass cytometry revealed that CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells expressing high Ly6C and CXCR3 levels caused tissue damage in the lungs of ALI mice, which was alleviated by MSCs. The scRNA-seq showed that Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells exhibited a more activated phenotype and decreased expression of proinflammatory factors that were enriched the most in immune chemotaxis after treatment with MSCs. We showed that CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells play an important role in MSC-mediated ALI remission, and both infiltration quantity and proinflammatory function were inhibited by MSCs, indicating a potential mechanism for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immunosuppressive effects of mesenchymal stem cells on lung B cell gene expression in LPS-induced acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Immune system disorders play important roles in acute lung injury (ALI), and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment can reduce inflammation during ALI. In this study, we compared the changes in lung B cells during MSC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the effects of MSCs on lung B cells in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. MSCs were administered intratracheally 4 h after LPS. As vehicle-treated controls, mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% C57BL/6 (PBS group). Histopathological changes, survival rate, inflammatory factor levels, and the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis was performed to evaluate the transcriptional changes in lung B cells between the PBS, LPS, and LPS/MSC groups on days 3 and 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MSC treatment ameliorated LPS-induced ALI, as indicated by the reductions in mortality, the levels of chemokines and cytokines in BALF, and the severity of lung tissue histopathology in ALI mice. Lung B cells in the PBS group remained undifferentiated and had an inhibitory phenotype. Based on our scRNA-Seq results, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lung B cells in both the PBS group and LPS group were involved in chemotaxis processes and some proinflammatory pathways. MSC treatment inhibited the expression of chemokine genes that were upregulated by LPS and were related to the recruitment of neutrophils into lung tissues. Immunoglobulin-related gene expression was decreased in lung B cells of mice treated with LPS/MSC for 7 days. The DEGs regulated by MSCs were enriched in biological processes, including humoral immune response and apoptotic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Lung B cells played an important role in the effects of treatment of ALI with MSCs. These observations provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of MSC treatment for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inflammatory Signals Induce AT2 Cell-Derived Damage-Associated Transient Progenitors that Mediate Alveolar Regeneration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue regeneration is a multi-step process mediated by diverse cellular hierarchies and states that are also implicated in tissue dysfunction and pathogenesis. Here we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing in combination with in vivo lineage tracing and organoid models to finely map the trajectories of alveolar-lineage cells during injury repair and lung regeneration. We identified a distinct AT2-lineage population, damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs), that arises during alveolar regeneration. We found that interstitial macrophage-derived IL-1β primes a subset of AT2 cells expressing Il1r1 for conversion into DATPs via a HIF1α-mediated glycolysis pathway, which is required for mature AT1 cell differentiation. Importantly, chronic inflammation mediated by IL-1β prevents AT1 differentiation, leading to aberrant accumulation of DATPs and impaired alveolar regeneration. Together, this stepwise mapping to cell fate transitions shows how an inflammatory niche controls alveolar regeneration by controlling stem cell fate and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Altered Gut Microbiome Profile in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32088998/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is considered a disease of the pulmonary vasculature. Limited progress has been made in preventing or arresting progression of PAH despite extensive efforts. Our previous studies indicated that PAH could be considered a systemic disease since its pathology involves interplay of multiple organs. This, coupled with increasing implication of the gut and its microbiome in chronic diseases, led us to hypothesize that patients with PAH exhibit a distinct gut microbiome that contributes to, and predicts, the disease. Fecal microbiome of 18 type 1 PAH patients (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 57.4, SD 16.7 mm Hg) and 13 reference subjects were compared by shotgun metagenomics to evaluate this hypothesis. Significant taxonomic and functional changes in microbial communities in the PAH cohort were observed. Pathways for the synthesis of arginine, proline, and ornithine were increased in PAH cohort compared with reference cohort. Additionally, groups of bacterial communities associated with trimethylamine/ trimethylamine N-oxide and purine metabolism were increased in PAH cohort. In contrast, butyrate-and propionate-producing bacteria such as Coprococcus, Butyrivibrio, Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, Akkermansia, and Bacteroides were increased in reference cohort. A random forest model predicted PAH from the composition of the gut microbiome with 83% accuracy. Finally, virome analysis showed enrichment of Enterococcal and relative depletion of Lactococcal phages in the PAH cohort. In conclusion, patients with PAH exhibit a unique microbiome profile that has the high predictive potential for PAH. This highlights previously unknown roles of gut bacteria in this disease and could lead to new therapeutic, diagnostic, or management paradigms for PAH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lung is inhabited by resident alveolar and interstitial macrophages as well as monocytic cells that survey lung tissues. Each cell type plays distinct functional roles under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions, but mechanisms establishing their molecular identities and functional potential remain poorly understood. In the present study, systematic evaluation of transcriptomes and open chromatin of alveolar macrophages (AMs), interstitial macrophages (IMs) and lung monocytes from two mouse strains enabled inference of common and cell-specific transcriptional regulators. We provide evidence that these factors drive selection of regulatory landscapes that specify distinct phenotypes of AMs and IMs and entrain qualitatively different responses to toll-like receptor 4 signaling in vivo. These studies reveal a striking divergence in a fundamental innate immune response pathway in AMs and establish a framework for further understanding macrophage diversity in the lung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibrosis can develop in most organs and causes organ failure. The most common type of lung fibrosis is known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in which fibrosis starts at the lung periphery and then progresses toward the lung center, eventually causing respiratory failure. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and periphery-to-center progression of the disease. Here we discovered that loss of Cdc42 function in alveolar stem cells (AT2 cells) causes periphery-to-center progressive lung fibrosis. We further show that Cdc42-null AT2 cells in both post-pneumonectomy and untreated aged mice cannot regenerate new alveoli, resulting in sustained exposure of AT2 cells to elevated mechanical tension. We demonstrate that elevated mechanical tension activates a TGF-β signaling loop in AT2 cells, which drives the periphery-to-center progression of lung fibrosis. Our study establishes a direct mechanistic link between impaired alveolar regeneration, mechanical tension, and progressive lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Age-Related Dopaminergic Innervation Augments T Helper 2-Type Allergic Inflammation in the Postnatal Lung</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young children are more susceptible to developing allergic asthma than adults. As neural innervation of the peripheral tissue continues to develop after birth, neurons may modulate tissue inflammation in an age-related manner. Here we showed that sympathetic nerves underwent a dopaminergic-to-adrenergic transition during post-natal development of the lung in mice and humans. Dopamine signaled through a specific dopamine receptor (DRD4) to promote T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation. The dopamine-DRD4 pathway acted synergistically with the cytokine IL-4 by upregulating IL-2-STAT5 signaling and reducing inhibitory histone trimethylation at Th2 gene loci. In murine models of allergen exposure, the dopamine-DRD4 pathway augmented Th2 inflammation in the lungs of young mice. However, this pathway operated marginally after sympathetic nerves became adrenergic in the adult lung. Taken together, the communication between dopaminergic nerves and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells provides an age-related mechanism underlying the susceptibility to allergic inflammation in the early lung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting Degradation of the Transcription Factor C/EBPβ Reduces Lung Fibrosis by Restoring Activity of the Ubiquitin-Editing Enzyme A20 in Macrophages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although recent progress provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), rare anti-PF therapeutics show definitive promise for treating this disease. Repeated lung epithelial injury results in injury-repairing response and inflammation, which drive the development of PF. Here, we report that chronic lung injury inactivated the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, causing progressive accumulation of the transcription factor C/EBPβ in alveolar macrophages (AMs) from PF patients and mice, which upregulated a number of immunosuppressive and profibrotic factors promoting PF development. In response to chronic lung injury, elevated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) interacted with and phosphorylated A20 to suppress C/EBPβ degradation. Ectopic expression of A20 or pharmacological restoration of A20 activity by disturbing the A20-GSK-3β interaction accelerated C/EBPβ degradation and showed potent therapeutic efficacy against experimental PF. Our study indicates that a regulatory mechanism of the GSK-3β-A20-C/EBPβ axis in AMs may be a potential target for treating PF and fibroproliferative lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tolerogenic signaling of alveolar macrophages induces lung adaptation to oxidative injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31356919/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inhaled oxidative toxicants present in ambient air cause airway epithelial injury, inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Effective adaptation to such environmental insults is essential for the preservation of pulmonary function, whereas failure or incomplete adaptation to oxidative injury can render the host susceptible to the development of airway disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; We sought to explore the mechanisms of airway adaptation to oxidative injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; For a model to study pulmonary adaptation to oxidative stress-induced lung injury, we exposed mice to repeated nose-only chlorine gas exposures. Outcome measures were evaluated 24 hours after the last chlorine exposure. Lung mechanics and airway responsiveness to methacholine were assessed by using the flexiVent. Inflammation and antioxidant responses were assessed in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue. Using both loss or gain of function and genomic approaches, we further dissected the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in pulmonary adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Repeated exposures to oxidative stress resulted in pulmonary adaptation evidenced by abrogation of neutrophilic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. This adaptation was independent of antioxidant mechanisms and regulatory T cells but dependent on residential alveolar macrophages (AMs). Interestingly, 5% of AMs expressed forkhead box P3, and depletion of these cells abolished adaptation. Results from transcriptomic profiling and loss and gain of function suggest that adaptation might be dependent on TGF-β and prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Pulmonary adaptation during oxidative stress-induced lung injury is mediated by a novel subset of forkhead box P3-positive AMs that limits inflammation, favoring airway adaptation and host fitness through TGF-β and prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent histotype of non-small cell lung cancer. Anoikis, an alternative form of programmed cell death, plays a pivotal role in cancer invasion and metastasis, preventing the detached cancer cells from readhering to other substrates for abnormal proliferation. The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive analyses of the prognostic implications of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in LUAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; ARGs were selected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Genecards dataset using differential expression analysis. The signature incorporating ARGs was identified using univariate Cox regression analysis and LASSO regression analysis. Furthermore, a nomogram containing the signature and clinical information was developed through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the predictive validity of these risk models. Finally, functional analysis of the selected ARGs in signature and analysis of immune landscape were also conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A 16-gene signature was integrated to stratify LUAD patients into different survival risk groups. The prognostic risk score generated from the signature and TNM stage were identified as independent prognostic factors and utilized to develop a nomogram. Both the signature and the nomogram showed satisfactory prediction performance in predicting overall survival (OS) of LUAD patients. The ARGs were enriched in several biological functions and signaling pathways. Finally, differences of immune landscape were investigated among the high- and low-risk groups stratified by the signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study revealed potential relationships between ARGs and prognosis of LUAD. The prognostic predictors identified in present study could be utilized as potential biomarkers for clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI)-recruited mononuclear phagocytes play a pivotal role in lung injury and repair. This study investigated the types of recruited mononuclear phagocytes and the immunotherapeutic effects of allograft mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice were orotracheally instilled with LPS (20 mg/kg). Compact bone-derived MSCs were administered orotracheally 4 h after LPS inhalation. Mononuclear phagocytes recruited in the lung tissues were characterized at different timepoints by high-dimensional analysis including flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Eight mononuclear phagocyte subsets recruited to LPS-challenged lungs were precisely identified. On day 3 after LPS administration, both Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes were recruited into acutely injured lungs, which was associated with increased secretion of neutrophil chemokines. Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes differentiated into M1 macrophages on day 3, and subsequently differentiated into CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) on day 7, while Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes differentiated into CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs on day 7. When ALI mice were treated with MSCs, the mortality significantly reduced. Notably, MSCs reduced the amount of M1 macrophages and reduced the secretion of neutrophil chemokines on day 3. Furthermore, MSCs reduced the number of CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mo-DCs and CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs on day 7, suppressing the antigen presentation process. Recruited mononuclear phagocyte subsets with a high level of CD38 exhibited an activated phenotype and could secrete higher levels of cytokines and chemokines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study characterized the dynamic functions and phenotypes of recruited mononuclear phagocytes in ALI mice and MSC-treated ALI mice.&lt;/p&gt;
