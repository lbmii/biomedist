      <title>Candida albicans can foster gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation during HIV infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt;) is a ubiquitous fungal commensal component of the human microbiota, and under certain circumstances, such as during an immunocompromised state, it may initiate different types of infection. Moreover, &lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt; continuously and reciprocally interacts with the host immune system as well as with other elements of the gut microbiota, thus contributing significantly to both gut homeostasis and host immunity. People living with HIV (PLWH), including those receiving antiretroviral therapy, are characterized by a depletion of CD4+ T-cells and dysbiosis in their gut. &lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt; colonization is frequent in PLWH, causing both a high prevalence and high morbidity. Gut barrier damage and elevated levels of microbial translocation are also fairly common in this population. Herein, we take a closer look at the reciprocity among &lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt;, gut microbiota, HIV, and the host immune system, thus throwing some light on this complex interplay.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Innate Checkpoint Determines Immune Dysregulation and Immunopathology during Pulmonary Murine Coronavirus Infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallmarks of life-threatening, coronavirus-induced disease include dysregulated antiviral immunity and immunopathological tissue injury. Nevertheless, the sampling of symptomatic patients overlooks the initial inflammatory sequela culminating in severe coronavirus-induced disease, leaving a fundamental gap in our understanding of the early mechanisms regulating anticoronavirus immunity and preservation of tissue integrity. In this study, we delineate the innate regulators controlling pulmonary infection using a natural mouse coronavirus. Within hours of infection, the cellular landscape of the lung was transcriptionally remodeled altering host metabolism, protein synthesis, and macrophage maturation. Genetic perturbation revealed that these transcriptional programs were type I IFN dependent and critically controlled both host cell survival and viral spread. Unrestricted viral replication overshooting protective IFN responses culminated in increased IL-1β and alarmin production and triggered compensatory neutrophilia, interstitial inflammation, and vascular injury. Thus, type I IFNs critically regulate early viral burden, which serves as an innate checkpoint determining the trajectory of coronavirus dissemination and immunopathology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schwann cell-derived exosomes containing MFG-E8 modify macrophage/microglial polarization for attenuating inflammation via the SOCS3/STAT3 pathway after spinal cord injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36717543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophage/microglia polarization acts as an important part in regulating inflammatory responses in spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the regulation of inflammation of Schwann cell-derived exosomes (SCDEs) for SCI repair is still unclear. Therefore, we intend to find out the effect of SCDEs on regulating the inflammation related to macrophage polarization during the recovery of SCI. Firstly, the thesis demonstrated that SCDEs could attenuate the LPS- inflammation in BMDMs by suppressing M1 polarization and stimulating M2 polarization. Similarly, SCDEs improved functional recovery of female Wistar rats of the SCI contusion model according to BBB (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan) score, electrophysiological assay, and the gait analysis system of CatWalk XT. Moreover, MFG-E8 was verified as the main component of SCDEs to improve the inflammatory response by proteomic sequencing and lentiviral transfection. Improvement of the inflammatory microenvironment also inhibited neuronal apoptosis. The knockout of MFG-E8 in SCs can reverse the anti-inflammatory effects of SCDEs treatment. The SOCS3/STAT3 signaling pathway was identified to participate in upregulating M2 polarization induced by MFG-E8. In conclusion, our findings will enrich the mechanism of SCDEs in repairing SCI and provide potential applications and new insights for the clinical translation of SCDEs treatment for SCI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vimentin affects inflammation and neutrophil recruitment in airway epithelium during Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36717839/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) frequently colonizes the swine upper respiratory tract and can cause Streptococcal disease in swine with clinical manifestations of pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia. Previously, we have shown that vimentin, a kind of intermediate filament protein, is involved in the penetration of SS2 through the tracheal epithelial barrier. The initiation of invasive disease is closely related to SS2-induced excessive local inflammation; however, the role of vimentin in airway epithelial inflammation remains unclear. Here, we show that vimentin deficient mice exhibit attenuated lung injury, diminished production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and the IL-8 homolog, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), and substantially reduced neutrophils in the lungs following intranasal infection with SS2. We also found that swine tracheal epithelial cells (STEC) without vimentin show decreased transcription of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8. SS2 infection caused reassembly of vimentin in STEC, and pharmacological disruption of vimentin filaments prevented the transcription of those proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, deficiency of vimentin failed to increase the transcription of nucleotide oligomerization domain protein 2 (NOD2), which is known to interact with vimentin, and the phosphorylation of NF-κB protein p65. This study provides insights into how vimentin promotes excessive airway inflammation, thereby exacerbating airway injury and SS2-induced systemic infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ADAR1 and ZBP1 in innate immunity, cell death, and disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADAR1 and ZBP1 are the only two mammalian proteins that contain Zα domains, which are thought to bind to nucleic acids in the Z-conformation. These two molecules are crucial in regulating diverse biological processes. While ADAR1-mediated RNA editing supports host survival and development, ZBP1-mediated immune responses provide host defense against infection and disease. Recent studies have expanded our understanding of the functions of ADAR1 and ZBP1 beyond their classical roles and established their fundamental regulation of innate immune responses, including NLRP3 inflammasome activation, inflammation, and cell death. Their roles in these processes have physiological impacts across development, infectious and inflammatory diseases, and cancer. In this review, we discuss the functions of ADAR1 and ZBP1 in regulating innate immune responses in development and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kirenol inhibits inflammation challenged by lipopolysaccharide through the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 autophagy pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36706589/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirenol is a bioactive substance isolated from &lt;em&gt;Herba Siegesbeckiae&lt;/em&gt;. Although the anti-inflammatory activity of kirenol has been well documented, its role in autophagy remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the protective role of kirenol on inflammation challenged by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in acute lung injury (ALI) cell and mouse models and unravel the underlying mechanisms, with a particular focus on autophagy. For this purpose, an ALI cell and mouse models were established, and the effects of kirenol on the expression of molecules related to inflammation and autophagy were examined. The present results revealed that kirenol could significantly inhibit inflammatory cytokines secretion in cells and in the mice injured by LPS; this effect may be attributed to enhanced autophagy as evidenced by the up-regulation of LC3-II and the down-regulation of p62 both in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylated AMPK and ULK1 increased, while phosphorylated mTOR decreased in the kirenol-treated ALI cell model. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy using AMPK inhibitor or 3-MA or chloroquine (CQ) reversed the anti-inflammatory and autophagy-enhancement effects of kirenol exposure in vitro, indicating that kirenol could enhance autophagy by activating the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 pathway. The results of RNA sequencing suggested that kirenol was strongly related to the biological functions of acute inflammatory response and the AMPK signaling pathway. Further in vivo ALI mouse model studies demonstrated the protective role of kirenol against lung inflammation, such as improved histopathology, decreased lung edema, and leukocyte infiltration were abolished by 3-MA. These findings implicate that kirenol can inhibit LPS-induced inflammation via the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 autophagy pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mast cell-mediated inflammation relies on insulin-regulated aminopeptidase controlling cytokine export from the Golgi</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36708814/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Upon activation, mast cells rapidly release preformed inflammatory mediators from large cytoplasmic granules via regulated exocytosis. This acute degranulation is followed by a late activation phase involving synthesis and secretion of cytokines, growth factors and other inflammatory molecules via the constitutive pathway that remains ill-defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Here we investigate the role for an insulin-responsive vesicle (IRV)-like endosomal compartment, marked by insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), in the secretion of TNF-α- and IL-6 in mast cells and macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Murine ko mouse models (IRAPko and kit-Wsh/sh) were used to study inflammatory disease models and to measure and mechanistically investigate cytokine secretion and degranulation in bone-marrow-derived mast cells in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We show that IRAPko mice are protected from TNF-α-dependent kidney injury and inflammatory arthritis. In the absence of IRAP, TNF-α and IL-6 but not IL-10 fail to be efficiently secreted. Moreover, chemical targeting of IRAP+ endosomes reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Mechanistically, impaired TNF-α export from the Golgi and reduced co-localization of VAMP3+ TNF-α transport vesicles with Stx4 was observed in IRAPko mast cells, while VAMP8-dependent exocytosis of secretory granules was facilitated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study describes a novel role for IRAP in mast cell-mediated inflammation through the regulation of exocytic trafficking of cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PLZF restricts intestinal ILC3 function in gut defense</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36693920/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) play important roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis by protecting the host from pathogen infections and tissue inflammation. The transcription factor PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger), encoded by zinc finger BTB domain containing 16 (Zbtb16), is highly and transiently expressed in ILC precursors (ILCPs). However, the role of PLZF in regulating ILC3 development and function remains unknown. Here, we show that PLZF was specifically expressed in mature intestinal ILC3s compared with other ILC subsets. PLZF was dispensable for ILC3 development. However, PLZF deficiency in ILC3s resulted in increased innate interleukin-22 (IL-22) secretion and protection against gut infection and inflammation. Mechanistically, PLZF negatively regulated IL-22 expression by ILC3s in a cell-intrinsic manner by binding to the IL-22 promoter region for transcriptional repression. Together, our data suggest that PLZF restricts intestinal ILC3 function to regulate gut immune homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting interleukin-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin pathways for novel pulmonary therapeutics in asthma and COPD</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36697211/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interleukin-33 (IL-33) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are alarmins that are released upon airway epithelial injury from insults such as viruses and cigarette smoke, and play critical roles in the activation of immune cell populations such as mast cells, eosinophils and group 2 innate lymphoid cells. Both cytokines were previously understood to primarily drive type 2 (T2) inflammation, but there is emerging evidence for a role for these alarmins to additionally mediate non-T2 inflammation, with recent clinical trial data in asthma and COPD cohorts with non-T2 inflammation providing support. Currently available treatments for both COPD and asthma provide symptomatic relief with disease control, improving lung function and reducing exacerbation rates; however, there still remains an unmet need for further improving lung function and reducing exacerbations, particularly for those not responsive to currently available treatments. The epithelial cytokines/alarmins are involved in exacerbations; biologics targeting TSLP and IL-33 have been shown to reduce exacerbations in moderate-to-severe asthma, either in a broad population or in specific subgroups, respectively. For COPD, while there is clinical evidence for IL-33 blockade impacting exacerbations in COPD, clinical data from anti-TSLP therapies is awaited. Clinical data to date support an acceptable safety profile for patients with airway diseases for both anti-IL-33 and anti-TSLP antibodies in development. We examine the roles of IL-33 and TSLP, their potential use as drug targets, and the evidence for target patient populations for COPD and asthma, together with ongoing and future trials focused on these targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silica exposure causes impaired lung function and lung tissue damage in wistar rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At different stages, the changes of intestinal microflora in rats were different after silica exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serum metabolites and disrupted multiple metabolic pathways differed after varied silica exposure exposure duration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The inflammation-metabolite-gut microbiota interaction axis varies at different stages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicosis is one of the most frequent, rapidly developing, and lethal types of pneumoconiosis. However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of its pathogenesis and progress remains unclear. We investigated the fundamental processes of silicosis incidence and progression using a combination of lung function testing, histopathology, 16 S rRNA, untargeted metabolomics, and cytokine chips at different exposure times (4 or 8 weeks). The results show that silica exposure damages lung tissue reduces lung function, and increases with time. Cytokines with time-specific properties were found in lung lavage fluid: IFN-γ (4 weeks; _P_＜0.05), TNF-α, M-CSF, GM-CSF (8 weeks; _P_＜0.01). In addition, silica exposure for different periods interferes to varying degrees with the metabolism of lipids. The composition of the intestinal microbiota changed with increasing exposure time and there were time-specific: &lt;em&gt;Allobaculum&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/em&gt;、 &lt;em&gt;Jeotgalicoccu&lt;/em&gt;、 &lt;em&gt;Coprococcus 1&lt;/em&gt; (4 weeks; _P_＜0.05), &lt;em&gt;Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group&lt;/em&gt;、 &lt;em&gt;Ruminiclostridium 5&lt;/em&gt; (8 weeks; _P_＜0.05). We found strong associations between cytokines, gut microbiota changes, and metabolic disturbances at different exposure times. These results suggest that time-specific changes in crosstalk among cytokines, the gut microbiota, and metabolites may be a potential mechanism for silica-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hUC-MSCs reduced lung injury and inflammation in mice with LPS-induced ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic YAP regulation on AECII was mediated by hUC-MSCs in LPS-induced ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inactivation of YAP facilitated LPS-induced AECII differentiation in response to hUC-MSCs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hUC-MSCs may have potential in the treatment of ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) contributes to higher mortality worldwide. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) have immunomodulatory and regenerative potential. However, the effects of hUC-MSCs as an ARDS treatment remain unclear. We investigated the role of hUC-MSCs in the differentiation of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) by regulating Yes-associated protein (YAP) in ARDS. Male C57BL/6JNarl mice were intratracheally (i.t.) administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an ARDS model, followed by a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of hUC-MSCs. hUC-MSCs improved pulmonary function, decreased inflammation on day 3, and mitigated lung injury by reducing the lung injury score and increasing lung aeration (%) in mice on day 7 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). hUC-MSCs inactivated YAP on AECII and facilitated cell differentiation by decreasing Pro-surfactant protein C (Pro-SPC) and galectin 3 (LGALS3) while increasing podoplanin (T1α) in lungs of mice (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In AECII MLE-12 cells, both coculture with hUC-MSCs after LPS exposure and the YAP inhibitor, verteporfin, reduced Pro-SPC and LGALS3, whereas the YAP inhibitor increased T1α expression (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In conclusion, hUC-MSCs ameliorated lung injury of ARDS and regulated YAP to facilitate AECII differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in lung epithelial cells triggers radiation-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36694200/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is the most common and serious complication of chest radiotherapy. However, reported radioprotective agents usually lead to radiation resistance in tumor cells. The key to solving this problem is to distinguish between the response of tumor cells and normal lung epithelial cells to radiation damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; RNA-Seq was used to recognize potential target of alleviating the progression of RILI as well as inhibiting tumor growth. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in lung epithelial cells was screened by qRT-PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence, and ELISA. An in vivo model of RILI and in vitro conditioned culture model were constructed to evaluate the effect of NLRP3/interleukin-1β on fibroblasts activation. ROS, ATP, and (NADP)+/NADP(H) level in lung epithelial cells was detected to explore the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The lung macrophages of the mice were deleted to evaluate the role of lung epithelial cells in RILI. Moreover, primary cells were extracted to validate the results obtained from cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; NLRP3 activation in epithelial cells after radiation depends on glycolysis-related reactive oxygen species accumulation. DPYSL4 is activated and acts as a negative regulator of this process. The NLRP3 inflammasome triggers interleukin-1β secretion, which directly affects fibroblast activation, proliferation, and migration, eventually leading to lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study suggests that NLRP3 inflammasome activation in lung epithelial cells is essential for radiation-induced lung injury. These data strongly indicate that targeting NLRP3 may be effective in reducing radiation-induced lung injury in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Homeostatic, Non-Canonical Role of Macrophage Elastase in Vascular Integrity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36691905/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12 is highly expressed in abdominal aortic aneurysms and its elastolytic function has been implicated in the pathogenesis. This concept is challenged, however, by conflicting data. Here, we sought to revisit the role of MMP-12 in abdominal aortic aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Apoe&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mmp12&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Apoe&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice were infused with Ang II (angiotensin). Expression of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) markers and complement component 3 (C3) levels were evaluated by immunostaining in aortas of surviving animals. Plasma complement components were analyzed by immunoassay. The effects of a complement inhibitor, IgG-FH1-5 (factor H-immunoglobulin G), and macrophage-specific MMP-12 deficiency on adverse aortic remodeling and death from rupture in Ang II-infused mice were determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Unexpectedly, death from aortic rupture was significantly higher in &lt;em&gt;Mmp12&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Apoe&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. This associated with more neutrophils, citrullinated histone H3 and neutrophil elastase, markers of NETs, and C3 levels in &lt;em&gt;Mmp12&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; aortas. These findings were recapitulated in additional models of abdominal aortic aneurysm. MMP-12 deficiency also led to more pronounced elastic laminae degradation and reduced collagen integrity. Higher plasma C5a in &lt;em&gt;Mmp12&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice pointed to complement overactivation. Treatment with IgG-FH1-5 decreased aortic wall NETosis and reduced adverse aortic remodeling and death from rupture in Ang II-infused &lt;em&gt;Mmp12&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Finally, macrophage-specific MMP-12 deficiency recapitulated the effects of global MMP-12 deficiency on complement deposition and NETosis, as well as adverse aortic remodeling and death from rupture in Ang II-infused mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; An MMP-12 deficiency/complement activation/NETosis pathway compromises aortic integrity, which predisposes to adverse vascular remodeling and abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture. Considering these new findings, the role of macrophage MMP-12 in vascular homeostasis demands re-evaluation of MMP-12 function in diverse settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zfp521 promotes chondrocytes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zfp521 maintains chondrocytes extracellular matrix homeostasis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zfp521 attenuates osteoarthritis via HDAC4 in the cell nucleus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether zinc finger protein 521 (Zfp521) has a chondroprotective effect by maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis to attenuate osteoarthritis (OA). In chondrocytes, Zfp521 was overexpressed or silenced to detect its effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and ECM homeostasis. Adenovirus encoding Zfp521 was injected into the knee joints of anterior cruciate ligament transection rats to test its efficacy against OA. Combined with proteomic analysis, the molecular mechanism of Zfp521 in cartilage degeneration was further explored. An intra-articular injection of adenovirus carrying a Zfp521 sequence showed a chondroprotective effect against OA. The molecular mechanism around Zfp521 was classified at the molecular, cellular, histological, and functional levels. It was reported that Zfp521 could effectively promote cartilage proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and maintain the balance of anabolism and catabolism of ECM. Moreover, it was confirmed that Zfp521 exerted its effect better by upregulating histone deacetylases 4 (HDAC4) in the nucleus and was significantly weakened in the absence of HDAC4 in the nucleus. Overall, Zfp521 better exerts its efficacy against OA by increasing the HDAC4 content in the nucleus, making it a promising strategy for OA treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery of 4-oxo-N-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide derivatives as novel anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of acute lung injury and sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36708679/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and sepsis, characterized by systemic inflammatory response syndrome, remain the major causes of death in severe patients. Inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines is considered to be a promising method for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases. In this study, a total of 28 4-oxo-N-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide derivatives were designed and synthesized and their anti-inflammatory activities in J774A.1 were evaluated. Among them, derivative 13a was found to significantly inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on J774A.1, THP-1 and LX-2 cells, and inhibited the activation of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, administration of 13ain vivo significantly improved the symptoms in LPS-induced ALI mice, including alleviation of pathological changes in the lung tissue, reduction of pulmonary edema, and inhibition of macrophage infiltration. Moreover, the administration of 13ain vivo significantly promoted survival in LPS-induced sepsis mice. 13a demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic properties with T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; value of 11.8 h and F value of 36.3%. Therefore, this study has identified a novel 4-oxo-N-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide derivative, 13a, which is an effective anti-inflammatory agent. The findings have laid a foundation for the further development of agents to treat ALI and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amounts of dopamine are negatively correlated with circulating ILC2 numbers in humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dopamine suppresses ILC2-driven allergic airway inflammation via DRD1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dopamine constrains ILC2 responses through inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local administration of dopamine may represent a promising therapeutic regimen for asthma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal signals have emerged as pivotal regulators of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that regulate tissue homeostasis and allergic inflammation. The molecular pathways underlying the neuronal regulation of ILC2 responses in lungs remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that the abundance of neurotransmitter dopamine was negatively correlated with circulating ILC2 numbers and positively associated with pulmonary function in humans. Dopamine potently suppressed lung ILC2 responses in a DRD1-receptor-dependent manner. Genetic deletion of &lt;em&gt;Drd1&lt;/em&gt; or local ablation of dopaminergic neurons augmented ILC2 responses and allergic lung inflammation. Transcriptome and metabolic analyses revealed that dopamine impaired the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway in ILC2s. Augmentation of OXPHOS activity with oltipraz antagonized the inhibitory effect of dopamine. Local administration of dopamine alleviated allergen-induced ILC2 responses and airway inflammation. These findings demonstrate that dopamine represents an inhibitory regulator of ILC2 responses in allergic airway inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STAT3 regulates CD8&#43; T cell differentiation and functions in cancer and acute infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36688918/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cancer, persistent antigens drive CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell differentiation into exhausted progenitor (T&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;prog&lt;/sup&gt;) and terminally exhausted (T&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;term&lt;/sup&gt;) cells. However, how the extrinsic and intrinsic regulatory mechanisms cooperate during this process still remains not well understood. Here, we found that STAT3 signaling plays essential roles in promoting intratumor T&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;term&lt;/sup&gt; cell development by enhancing their effector functions and survival, which results in better tumor control. In tumor microenvironments, STAT3 is predominantly activated by IL-10 and IL-21, but not IL-6. Besides, STAT3 also plays critical roles in the development and function of terminally differentiated effector CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in acute infection. Mechanistically, STAT3 transcriptionally promotes the expression of effector function-related genes, while it suppresses those expressed by the progenitor T&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; subset. Moreover, STAT3 functions in collaboration with BATF and IRF4 to mediate chromatin activation at the effector gene loci. Thus, we have elucidated the roles of STAT3 signaling in terminally differentiated CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell development, especially in cancer, which benefits the development of more effective immunotherapies against tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD-NTase family member MB21D2 promotes cGAS-mediated antiviral and antitumor immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36681781/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) family members are immune sensors that synthesize diverse nucleotide signals to initiate antiviral response in bacteria and animals. As a founding member of CD-NTase enzyme, cGAS has been identified as a key sensor for cytoplasmic DNA and type I interferons (IFNs) signaling in metazoan. However, the functions of other metazoan CD-NTases remain enigmatic. Here, we showed that Mab-21 domain-containing protein 2 (MB21D2), another member of the CD-NTase family, plays a positive role in modulating the cGAS-STING signaling in myeloid cells. Deficiency of MB21D2 in THP-1 cells or mice macrophages led to impaired production of type I interferon upon DNA stimulation. Consistently, &lt;em&gt;Mb21d2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice showed more susceptible to infection with DNA virus and faster growth of melanoma, compared to its counterparts. Mechanistically, MB21D2 specially bound with the N-terminal of cGAS, facilitated its liquid phase condensation and DNA-binding activity, leading to the enhanced production of cGAMP and subsequent IFN-β production. Thus, our findings unveiled that the CD-NTase family member MB21D2 contributes to host antiviral and antitumor responses by enhancing cGAS activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2, primarily authenticated in November 2021 in South Africa, has initiated the 5th wave of global pandemics. Here, we systemically examined immunological and metabolic characteristics of Omicron variants infection. We found Omicron resisted to neutralizing antibody targeting receptor binding domain (RBD) of wildtype SARS-CoV-2. Omicron could hardly be neutralized by sera of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescents infected with the Delta variant. Through mass spectrometry on MHC-bound peptidomes, we found that the spike protein of the Omicron variants could generate additional CD8 + T cell epitopes, compared with Delta. These epitopes could induce robust CD8 + T cell responses. Moreover, we found booster vaccination increased the cross-memory CD8 + T cell responses against Omicron. Metabolic regulome analysis of Omicron-specific T cell showed a metabolic profile that promoted the response of memory T cells. Consistently, a greater fraction of memory CD8 + T cells existed in Omicron stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, CD147 was also a receptor for the Omicron variants, and CD147 antibody inhibited infection of Omicron. CD147-mediated Omicron infection in a human CD147 transgenic mouse model induced exudative alveolar pneumonia. Taken together, our data suggested that vaccination booster and receptor blocking antibody are two effective strategies against Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA GAS5 suppresses inflammatory responses by inhibiting HMGB1 release via miR-155-5p/SIRT1 axis in sepsis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis comprises a lethal immunologic response due to infection. Increasingly, evidence has demonstrated the important role of long non-coding RNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) in the regulation of sepsis. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which GAS5 participates in the progression of sepsis remain unclear. Our study demonstrated the role and underlying mechanism of GAS5 in regulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation. In this study, GAS5 expression was found to be markedly decreased in serum samples of sepsis patients and a sepsis mouse model, and was negatively related with HMGB1 expression. GAS5 overexpression inhibited cell inflammatory responses by decreasing HMGB1 release. Furthermore, GAS5 inhibited LPS-mediated hyperacetylation and the release of HMGB1 by increasing the expression of sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Additionally, upregulated GAS5 attenuated inflammatory responses in vitro and vivo, and the knockdown of a miR-155-5p mimic and SIRT1 rescued the effects of GAS5 upregulation. Mechanistically, GAS5 sponged miR-155-5p to upregulate SIRT1, thereby inhibiting HMGB1 acetylation and release. In conclusion, our findings indicate that GAS5 suppresses inflammatory responses by modulating the miR-155-5p/SIRT1/HMGB1 axis in sepsis, providing a novel therapeutic target for inflammation in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dendrimer-Mediated Intracellular Delivery of Fibronectin Guides Macrophage Polarization to Alleviate Acute Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibronectin (FN) is an essential glycoprotein in the extracellular matrix with favorable biological functions for potential applications in various biomedical fields including wound healing, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, as well as diagnosis and treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. Herein, we aim to explore the influence of intracellular FN delivery on macrophage functions and its possible therapeutic applications. We prepared phenylboronic acid (PBA)-functionalized generation 5 (G5) poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (G5.NH2-PBA) as a nanocarrier to load FN, and reveal that the obtained dendrimers enable efficient intracellular delivery of FN at an optimized dendrimer-to-FN weight ratio of 8, which guides macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype polarization. Studies on action mechanisms show that the dendrimer-mediated FN intracellular delivery acts strongly on suppressing the nuclear factor-κB pathway, leading to reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and enhanced reactive oxygen species depletion in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. Further investigation in vivo using an LPS-induced mouse model of acute lung injury (ALI) shows that the dendrimer-mediated FN delivery can effectively alleviate the ALI symptoms through alleviation of lung inflammation and oxidation stress. Our work suggests a general approach to using dendrimers for mediating intracellular delivery of FN, thereby offering many opportunities to explore the biological functions of FN for different therapeutic applications toward inflammation-associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery of alantolactone as a natural NLRP3 inhibitor to alleviate NLRP3-driven inflammatory diseases in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36668704/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and purpose:&lt;/em&gt; NLRP3 inflammasome activation is involved in many inflammatory diseases, however, no small-molecule inhibitors of NLRP3 have been clinically used so far. Discovery of natural NLRP3 inhibitors may be beneficial to the design and development of molecules targeting NLRP3. Alantolactone (ALA) is a natural compound isolated from a traditional Chinese medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory activity, but the precise target of ALA remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental approach:&lt;/em&gt; The inhibitory activity of 150 natural compounds against NLRP3-driven IL-1β production was screened in macrophages. Mice models of gouty arthritis and acute lung injury were used to determine the efficacy of the potential compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key results:&lt;/em&gt; Among 150 compounds in an in-house natural products bank, ALA was found to possess the highest inhibitory activity against LPS + ATP-induced IL-1β production in macrophages. We demonstrated that ALA suppressed the IL-1β secretion, the caspase-1 activation, and pyroptosis in LPS + ATP-challenged macrophages. Further studies showed that ALA directly bound to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 to inhibit the activation and assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome. The molecular simulation showed that Arg335 in NLRP3 might be a critical residue for ALA binding, leading to suppression of NLRP3-NEK7 interaction. The &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; studies validated that ALA significantly alleviated NLRP3-driven inflammatory diseases, including acute lung injury and gouty arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion and implications:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, we identified ALA as a natural inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome by directly targeting NLRP3 NACHT domain. ALA shows great potential in the treatment of NLRP3-driven diseases and the development of novel NLRP3 inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human endoderm stem cells reverse inflammation-related acute liver failure through cystatin SN-mediated inhibition of interferon signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36670290/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute liver failure (ALF) is a life-threatening disease that occurs secondary to drug toxicity, infection or a devastating immune response. Orthotopic liver transplantation is an effective treatment but limited by the shortage of donor organs, the requirement for life-long immune suppression and surgical challenges. Stem cell transplantation is a promising alternative therapy for fulminant liver failure owing to the immunomodulatory abilities of stem cells. Here, we report that when transplanted into the liver, human endoderm stem cells (hEnSCs) that are germ layer-specific and nontumorigenic cells derived from pluripotent stem cells are able to effectively ameliorate hepatic injury in multiple rodent and swine drug-induced ALF models. We demonstrate that hEnSCs tune the local immune microenvironment by skewing macrophages/Kupffer cells towards an anti-inflammatory state and by reducing the infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and inflammatory T helper cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of infiltrating and resident monocytes/macrophages isolated from animal livers revealed dramatic changes, including changes in gene expression that correlated with the change of activation states, and dynamic population heterogeneity among these cells after hEnSC transplantation. We further demonstrate that hEnSCs modulate the activation state of macrophages/Kupffer cells via cystatin SN (CST1)-mediated inhibition of interferon signaling and therefore highlight CST1 as a candidate therapeutic agent for diseases that involve over-activation of interferons. We propose that hEnSC transplantation represents a novel and powerful cell therapeutic treatment for ALF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amomum subulatum mitigates experimental thoracic radiation-induced lung injury by regulating antioxidant status and inflammatory responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36655677/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is one of the most prominent complications of thoracic radiotherapy for which effective therapy is still lacking. This study investigates the nutraceutical potential of the culinary spice &lt;em&gt;Amomum subulatum&lt;/em&gt; in mitigating thoracic radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Mouse models of RP and PF were established by whole thorax irradiation at a dose of 25 gray. C57BL/6 mice were administered with 250 mg per kg body weight of methanolic extract of &lt;em&gt;A. subulatum&lt;/em&gt; dry fruits (MEAS) for four consecutive weeks and observed for changes in lung tissue antioxidant activities, oxidative stress parameters, and expression of antioxidant, inflammation, and fibrosis-related genes by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR analysis, and histology analysis. MEAS administration reduced radiation-induced oxidative stress by enhancing the expression of Nrf2 and its target genes. Irradiation increased gene expression of inflammatory mediators and lung histology further confirmed the characteristics of RP, which were reduced by MEAS treatment. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed the potential of MEAS in reducing the radiation-induced elevation of cyclooxygenase 2 expression in the lungs. The late sequel of RILI was manifested as PF, characterized by the elevated expression of pro-fibrotic genes and increased collagen content. However, MEAS administration markedly reduced radiation-induced fibrotic changes in the lungs. These effects might be attributed to the synergistic effect of bioactive polyphenols in MEAS with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic efficacies. Taken together, this study demonstrates the potential of MEAS in mitigating RILI, suggesting the possible nutraceutical application of &lt;em&gt;A. subulatum&lt;/em&gt; against radiation toxicities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C-type lectin Mincle initiates IL-17-mediated inflammation in acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36680813/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) has a poor prognosis and high mortality. However, there is limited information regarding the mechanisms of AE-IPF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; We aimed to explore the function of macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) in AE-IPF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In the present study, Mincle was detected in the lung tissues of AE-IPF patients. Mincle-deficient (&lt;em&gt;Mincle&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were administered bleomycin (BLM), followed by HSV1 viral infection to establish the AE-IPF model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Mincle was increased in the lung tissues of AE-IPF patients compared with those with stable IPF (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04) and healthy controls (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009). The survival rate of the &lt;em&gt;Mincle&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;+BLM+HSV group was higher than that of the WT+BLM+HSV group. The mice in the &lt;em&gt;Mincle&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;+BLM+HSV group exhibited milder inflammation and lower acute lung injury scores (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.008). Mincle was expressed on inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils (CD11b+Gr1 +F4/80-) and monocyte-derived macrophages (Mo-AMs, CD11b+Gr1 +F4/80 +) in the BALF of AE-IPF mice. Mo-AMs were significantly increased in the WT+BLM+HSV group compared with the WT+BLM+PBS (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and Mincle-/-+BLM+HSV (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0009) groups. Deletion of Mincle decreased the proportion of Th17 cells and Mo-AMs in the &lt;em&gt;Mincle&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;+BLM+HSV group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Mincle contributed to acute inflammation in AE-IPF by promoting Th17 differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Formyl peptide receptor 2 activation by mitochondrial formyl peptides stimulates the neutrophil proinflammatory response via the ERK pathway and exacerbates ischemia-reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36658472/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an inevitable process in renal transplantation that significantly increases the risk of delayed graft function, acute rejection, and even graft loss. Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) is an important receptor in multiple septic and aseptic injuries, but its functions in kidney IRI are still unclear. This study was designed to reveal the pathological role of FPR2 in kidney IRI and its functional mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To explore the mechanism of FPR2 in kidney IRI, the model rats were sacrificed after IRI surgery. Immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and western blotting were used to detect differences in the expression of FPR2 and its ligands between the IRI and control groups. WRW4 (WRWWWW-NH2), a specific antagonist of FPR2, was administered to kidney IRI rats. Kidney function and pathological damage were detected to assess kidney injury and recovery. Flow cytometry was used to quantitatively compare neutrophil infiltration among the experimental groups. Mitochondrial formyl peptides (mtFPs) were synthesized and administered to primary rat neutrophils together with the specific FPR family antagonist WRW4 to verify our hypothesis in vitro. Western blotting and cell function assays were used to examine the functions and signaling pathways that FPR2 mediates in neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; FPR2 was activated mainly by mtFPs during the acute phase of IRI, mediating neutrophil migration and reactive oxygen species production in the rat kidney through the ERK1/2 pathway. FPR2 blockade in the early phase protected rat kidneys from IRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; mtFPs activated FPR2 during the acute phase of IRI and mediated rat kidney injury by activating the migration and reactive oxygen species generation of neutrophils through the ERK1/2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GATA6-AS1 regulates intestinal epithelial mitochondrial functions, and its reduced expression is linked to intestinal inflammation and less favorable disease course in ulcerative colitis (UC)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36655602/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Widespread dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) including a reduction in GATA6-AS1 was noted in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We previously reported a prominent inhibition of epithelial mitochondrial functions in UC. However, the connection between reduction of GATA6-AS1 expression and attenuated epithelial mitochondrial functions was not yet defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mucosal transcriptomics was used to conform GATA6-AS1 reduction in several treatment naïve independent human cohorts (n=673). RNA pull-down followed by mass-spectrometry was used to determine GATA6-AS1 interactome. Metabolomics and mitochondrial respiration following GATA6-AS1 silencing in Caco-2, were used to elaborate on GATA6-AS1 functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; GATA6-AS1 showed predominant expression in gut epithelia using single cell datasets. GATA6-AS1 levels were reduced in Crohn disease (CD) ileum and in ulcerative colitis (UC) rectum in independent cohorts. Reduced GATA6-AS1 lncRNA was further linked to more severe UC form, and to less favorable UC course. GATA6-AS1 interactome showed robust enrichment for mitochondrial proteins, and included TGM2, an autoantigen in celiac disease that is induced in UC, CD, and celiac, in contrast GATA6-AS1 reduction in these cohorts. GATA6-AS1 silencing resulted in induction of TGM2, and this was coupled with reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial respiration, as well as in reduction of metabolites linked with aerobic respiration relevant to mucosal inflammation. TGM2 knockdown in GATA6-AS1 deficient cells rescued mitochondrial respiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; GATA6-AS1 levels are reduced in UC, CD, and celiac, and in more severe UC forms. We highlight GATA6-AS1 as a target regulating epithelial mitochondrial functions, potentially through controlling TGM2 levels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CCR7L-upregulated Extl1 promotes CCR7-triggered DC migration via HSPG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extl1 mediates DC HSPG production via the glycosyltransferase domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extl1/HSPG axis enhances DC CCR7 expression and internalization by inhibiting C1q&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extl1 balances T cell-mediated immunity and tolerance by strengthening DC migration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CCR7-triggered DC migration toward draining lymph nodes is critical for the initiation of protective immunity and maintenance of immune tolerance. How to promote CCR7-mediated DC migration to determine T cell responses under inflammatory and homeostatic conditions remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the Extl1 (Exostosin like glycosyltransferase 1) promotes CCR7-triggered DC migration in a heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG)-dependent manner. Mechanistically, Extl1 mediates HSPG production via its glycosyltransferase domain to inhibit C1q expression. Extl1/HSPG axis relieves C1q-mediated restriction of CCR7 surface expression and internalization, and thus enhances CCR7-dependent migratory signaling activation. Consequently, Extl1 is required for DC-mediated Th1 and Th17 responses in immune defense against bacterial infection and for Treg cell development in the prevention of autoimmunity. Our study adds mechanistic insights to the regulation of CCR7-triggered DC migration in immunity and tolerance and provides a potential target for the treatment of infectious and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scavenger receptor BI attenuates oxidized phospholipid-induced pulmonary inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36681128/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These studies demonstrate that scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) limits the lung pathology and inflammation following the generation of the danger associated molecular pattern oxidized phospholipids (oxPL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These findings indicate that if SR-BI is dysfunctional, there is a lack of oxPL clearance, dysfunctional lipid metabolism, and increased toll-like receptor 4 signaling in the lung leading to increased lung pathologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules released from dead/dying cells following toxicant and/or environmental exposures that activate the immune response through binding pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Excessive production of DAMPs or failed clearance leads to chronic inflammation and delayed inflammation resolution. One category of DAMPs are oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs) produced upon exposure to high levels of oxidative stress, such as following ozone (O3)- induced inflammation. OxPLs are bound by multiple classes of PRRs that include scavenger receptors (SRs) such as SR class B-1 (SR-BI) and toll-like receptors (TLRs). Interactions between oxPLs and PRRs appear to regulate inflammation; however, the role of SR-BI in oxPL-induced lung inflammation has not been defined. Therefore, we hypothesize that SR-BI is critical in protecting the lung from oxPL-induced pulmonary inflammation/injury. To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6 J (WT) female mice were dosed with oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (oxPAPC) by oropharyngeal aspiration and identified increased pulmonary SR-BI expression. Following oxPAPC exposure, SR-BI deficient (SR-BI&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) mice exhibited increased lung pathology and inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production. Lipidomic analysis revealed that SR-BI&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had an altered pulmonary lipidome prior to and following oxPAPC exposure, which correlated with increased oxidized phosphatidylcholines (PCs). Finally, we characterized TLR4-mediated activation of NF-κB following oxPAPC exposure and discovered that SR-BI&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased TLR4 mRNA expression in lung tissue and macrophages, increased nuclear p65, and decreased cytoplasmic IκBα. Overall, we conclude that SR-BI is required for limiting oxPAPC-induced lung pathology by maintaining lipid homeostasis, reducing oxidized PCs, and attenuating TLR4-NF-κB activation thereby preventing excessive and persistent inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The antimicrobial peptide LK2(6)A(L) exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by binding to the myeloid differentiation 2 domain and protects against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36706531/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LK2(6)A(L) reflected anti-inflammatory activity through TLR4 signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LK2(6)A(L) interacted with MD2 and the knockdown MD2 abolished its anti-inflammatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key domain of LK2(6)A(L) binding to MD2 was its amino acid domain 7–13 (IS-7).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LK2(6)A(L) and IS-7 displayed protective effects in LPS-induced ALI mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease that is generally attributable to an uncontrolled inflammatory response in the lung, but there is a lack of effective treatments. At present, regulating the inflammatory response has become an important strategy for treating ALI. In the present study, LK2(6)A(L), a peptide derived from the natural antimicrobial peptide temporin-1CEa, inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and NO in RAW264.7 cells. Herein, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of LK2(6)A(L) was investigated. The RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) results showed that LK2(6)A(L) significantly inhibited the TLR4-mediated NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. The results of co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), pull-down experiment, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) suggested that MD2 was the direct target of LK2(6)A(L). Chemical inhibition of MD2 and its knockdown abolished the anti-inflammatory effect of LK2(6)A(L). Molecular dynamic simulation indicated that LK2(6)A(L) could bind to the active domain of the MD2 hydrophobic pocket via six hydrogen bonds. The truncated peptides were designed based on analysis of the molecular docking of LK2(6)A(L) to MD2. The truncated peptide IS-7 showed strong affinity to MD2 and a remarkable inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory factors that was comparable to the effect of LK2(6)A(L). Finally, LK2(6)A(L) and IS-7 relieved inflammatory symptoms and lung tissue destruction in the ALI mouse model. Overall, our study suggested that LK2(6)A(L) showed promising anti-inflammatory activity by targeting MD2, and the amino acid domain 7-13 was an important area that binds with MD2 and also an anti-inflammatory active region. LK2(6)A(L) and IS-7 may be potential new treatments for ALI and other acute inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Type I interferon/STAT1 signaling regulates UBE2M-mediated antiviral innate immunity in a negative feedback manner</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UBE2M inhibits STUB1-mediated RIG-I degradation to resist RNA virus infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-I/STAT1 negatively regulates UBE2M-induced antiviral immunity via TRIM21&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mEVs/TRIM21-ΔRING are promising antiviral reagents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling is central to inducing antiviral innate immunity. However, the mechanisms for IFN-I signaling self-regulation are still largely unknown. Here, we report that RNA virus-infected macrophages with UBE2M deficiency produced decreased IFN-I expression in a RIG-I-dependent manner, causing an aggravated viral infection. Mechanistically, UBE2M inhibits RIG-I degradation by preventing the interaction of RIG-I and E3 ligase STUB1, resulting in antiviral IFN-I signaling activation. Simultaneously, IFN-I signaling-activated STAT1 facilitates the transcription of &lt;em&gt;Trim21&lt;/em&gt;, leading to increased UBE2M degradation and blunted antiviral immunity. Translationally, oral administration of milk-derived extracellular vesicles containing RING domain-truncated TRIM21 (TRIM21-ΔRING) lacking E3 ligase activity efficiently transfers TRIM21-ΔRING into macrophages. TRIM21-ΔRING suppresses UBE2M degradation by competitively binding to UBE2M with TRIM21, thereby enhancing antiviral immunity. Overall, we reveal a negative feedback loop of IFN-I signaling and develop a reagent to improve innate immunity against RNA viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In vivo induction of activin A-producing alveolar macrophages supports the progression of lung cell carcinoma</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are crucial for maintaining normal lung function. They are abundant in lung cancer tissues, but their pathophysiological significance remains unknown. Here we show, using an orthotopic murine lung cancer model and human carcinoma samples, that AMs support cancer cell proliferation and thus contribute to unfavourable outcome. Inhibin beta A (INHBA) expression is upregulated in AMs under tumor-bearing conditions, leading to the secretion of activin A, a homodimer of INHBA. Accordingly, follistatin, an antagonist of activin A is able to inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation. Single-cell RNA sequence analysis identifies a characteristic subset of AMs specifically induced in the tumor environment that are abundant in INHBA, and distinct from INHBA-expressing AMs in normal lungs. Moreover, postnatal deletion of INHBA/activin A could limit tumor growth in experimental models. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the critical pathological role of activin A-producing AMs in tumorigenesis, and provides means to clearly distinguish them from their healthy counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger strong inflammatory responses and cause severe lung damage in COVID-19 patients with critical illness. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the infection induces excessive inflammatory responses are not fully understood. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in the formation of viral Z-RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells and thereby activates the ZBP1-RIPK3 pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of RIPK3 by GSK872 or genetic deletion of MLKL reduced SARS-CoV-2-induced IL-1β release. ZBP1 or RIPK3 deficiency leads to reduced production of both inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during SARS-CoV-2 infection both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, deletion of ZBP1 or RIPK3 alleviated SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced immune cell infiltration and lung damage in infected mouse models. These results suggest that the ZBP1-RIPK3 pathway plays a critical role in SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses and lung damage. Our study provides novel insights into how SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers inflammatory responses and lung pathology, and implicates the therapeutic potential of targeting ZBP1-RIPK3 axis in treating COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Reparative Roles of IL-33</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discovered in the early 2000s, interleukin-33 (IL-33) was characterized as a potent driver of type 2 immunity and implicated in parasite clearance, as well as asthma, allergy, and lung fibrosis. Yet research in other models has since revealed that IL-33 is a highly pleiotropic molecule with diverse functions. These activities are supported by elusive release mechanisms and diverse expression of the IL-33 receptor, STimulation 2 (ST2), on both immune and stromal cells. Interestingly, IL-33 also supports type 1 immune responses during viral and tumor immunity and after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Yet the IL-33-ST2 axis is also critical to the establishment of systemic homeostasis and tissue repair and regeneration. Despite these recent findings, the mechanisms by which IL-33 governs the balance between immunity and homeostasis or can support both effective repair and pathogenic fibrosis are poorly understood. As such, ongoing research is trying to understand the potential reparative and regulatory versus pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic roles for IL-33 in transplantation. This review provides an overview of the emerging regenerative role of IL-33 in organ homeostasis and tissue repair as it relates to transplantation immunology. It also outlines the known impacts of IL-33 in commonly transplanted solid organs and covers the envisioned roles for IL-33 in ischemia-reperfusion injury, rejection, and tolerance. Finally, we give a comprehensive summary of its effects on different cell populations involved in these processes, including ST2+ regulatory T cells, innate lymphoid cell type 2, as well as significant myeloid cell populations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fecal microbiota transplantation from young mice rejuvenates aged hematopoietic stem cells by suppressing inflammations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging is accompanied by hematopoietic reconstitution dysfunction, including loss of regenerative and engraftment ability, myeloid differentiation bias and elevated risks of hematopoietic malignancies. Gut microbiota, a key regulator of host health and immunity, has been recently reported to impact hematopoiesis. However, there is currently limited empirical evidence elucidating the direct impact of gut microbiome on aging hematopoiesis. In this study, we performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from young mice to aged mice and observed significant increment in lymphoid differentiation and decrease in myeloid differentiation in aged recipient mice. Further, FMT from young mice rejuvenated aged HSCs with enhanced short-term and long-term hematopoietic repopulation capacity. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing deciphered that FMT from young mice mitigated inflammatory signals, upregulated FoxO signaling pathway and promoted lymphoid differentiation of HSCs during aging. Finally, integrated microbiome and metabolome analyses uncovered that FMT reshaped gut microbiota construction and metabolite landscape, and Lachnospiraceae and tryptophan-associated metabolites promoted the recovery of hematopoiesis and rejuvenated aged HSCs. Together, our study highlights the paramount importance of the gut microbiota in HSC aging and provides insights into therapeutic strategies for aging-related hematologic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>p53 engages the cGAS/STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway for tumor suppression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36638783/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wild-type p53 (WTp53) activates the cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS/STING pathway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTp53 requires TRIM24 to promote TREX1 degradation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TREX1 degradation causes cytosolic DNA accumulation and activation of cGAS/STING&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of cGAS or STING compromises WTp53’s tumor suppressor activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor suppression by TP53 involves cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. TP53 can suppress tumor growth by modulating immune system functions; however, the mechanistic basis for this activity is not well understood. We report that p53 promotes the degradation of the DNA exonuclease TREX1, resulting in cytosolic dsDNA accumulation. We demonstrate that p53 requires the ubiquitin ligase TRIM24 to induce TREX1 degradation. The cytosolic DNA accumulation resulting from TREX1 degradation activates the cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS/STING pathway, resulting in induction of type I interferons. TREX1 overexpression sufficed to block p53 activation of the cGAS/STING pathway. p53-mediated induction of type I interferon (IFNB1) is suppressed by cGAS/STING knockout, and p53&amp;rsquo;s tumor suppressor activities are compromised by the loss of signaling through the cGAS/STING pathway. Thus, our study reveals that p53 utilizes the cGAS/STING innate immune system pathway for both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic tumor suppressor activities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective effect of soloxolone derivatives in carrageenan- and LPS-driven acute inflammation: Pharmacological profiling and their effects on key inflammation-related processes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36640672/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/36640672/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soloxolone derivatives (SDs) effectively ameliorate carrageenan-induced inflammation and LPS-stimulated ALI in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SDs suppress the expression of key inflammatory genes in inflamed sites and the functional activity of murine macrophages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SDs inhibit macrophage NO production by both suppression of Nos2 expression and probable direct interaction with iNOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soloxolone methyl (SM) displays cytoprotective effect on inflamed pneumocytes and does not affect their ALI-driven EMT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SM directly inhibits the activity of thrombin involved in the regulation of inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-inflammatory potential of three cyanoenone-containing triterpenoids, including soloxolone methyl (SM), soloxolone (S) and its novel derivative bearing at the C-30 amidoxime moiety (SAO), was studied in murine models of acute inflammation. It was found that the compounds effectively suppressed the development of carrageenan-induced paw edema and peritonitis as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-driven acute lung injury (ALI) with therapeutic outcomes comparable with that of the reference drugs indomethacin and dexamethasone. Non-immunogenic carrageenan-stimulated inflammation was more sensitive to the transformation of C-30 of SM compared with immunogenic LPS-induced inflammation: the anti-inflammatory properties of the studied compounds against carrageenan-induced paw edema and peritonitis decreased in the order of SAO &amp;gt; S &amp;gt; &amp;gt; SM, whereas the efficiency of these triterpenoids against LPS-driven ALI was similar (SAO ≈ S ≈ SM). Further studies demonstrated that soloxolone derivatives significantly inhibited a range of immune-related processes, including granulocyte influx and the expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the inflamed sites as well as the functional activity of macrophages. Moreover, SM was found to prevent inflammation-associated apoptosis of A549 pneumocytes and effectively inhibited the protease activity of thrombin (IC50 = 10.3 µM) tightly associated with rodent inflammatome. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that soloxolone derivatives can be considered as novel promising anti-inflammatory drug candidates with multi-targeted mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TREM2hi resident macrophages protect the septic heart by maintaining cardiomyocyte homeostasis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM) is common in septic patients with a high mortality and is characterized by an abnormal immune response. Owing to cellular heterogeneity, understanding the roles of immune cell subsets in SICM has been challenging. Here we identify a unique subpopulation of cardiac-resident macrophages termed CD163&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;RETNLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Mac1), which undergoes self-renewal during sepsis and can be targeted to prevent SICM. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing with fate mapping in a mouse model of sepsis, we demonstrate that the Mac1 subpopulation has distinct transcriptomic signatures enriched in endocytosis and displays high expression of TREM2 (TREM2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;). TREM2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Mac1 cells actively scavenge cardiomyocyte-ejected dysfunctional mitochondria. &lt;em&gt;Trem2&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in macrophages impairs the self-renewal capability of the Mac1 subpopulation and consequently results in defective elimination of damaged mitochondria, excessive inflammatory response in cardiac tissue, exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and decreased survival. Notably, intrapericardial administration of TREM2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Mac1 cells prevents SICM. Our findings suggest that the modulation of TREM2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Mac1 cells could serve as a therapeutic strategy for SICM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amino Derivatives of Diaryl Pyrimidines and Azolopyrimidines as Protective Agents against LPS-Induced Acute Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of lung damage originating from excessive inflammation and cytokine release during various types of infections remains relevant and stimulates the search for highly effective and safe drugs. The biological activity of the latter may be associated with the regulation of hyperactivation of certain immune cells and enzymes. Here, we propose the design and synthesis of amino derivatives of 4,6- and 5,7-diaryl substituted pyrimidines and [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines as promising double-acting pharmacophores inhibiting IL-6 and NO. The anti-inflammatory activity of 14 target compounds was studied on isolated primary murine macrophages after LPS stimulation. Seven compounds were identified to inhibit the synthesis of nitric oxide and interleukin 6 at a concentration of 100 µM. The most active compounds are micromolar inhibitors of IL-6 secretion and NO synthesis, showing a minimal impact on innate immunity, unlike the reference drug dexamethasone, along with acceptable cytotoxicity. Evaluation in an animal model of acute lung injury proved the protective activity of compound 6e, which was supported by biochemical, cytological and morphological markers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD16&#43; natural killer cells in bronchoalveolar lavage are associated with antibody-mediated rejection and chronic lung allograft dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36695619/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute and chronic rejections limit the long-term survival after lung transplant. Pulmonary antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is an incompletely understood driver of long-term outcomes characterized by donor-specific antibodies (DSAs), innate immune infiltration, and evidence of complement activation. Natural killer (NK) cells may recognize DSAs via the CD16 receptor, but this complement-independent mechanism of injury has not been explored in pulmonary AMR. CD16+ NK cells were quantified in 508 prospectively collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 195 lung transplant recipients. Associations between CD16+ NK cells and human leukocyte antigen mismatches, DSAs, and AMR grade were assessed by linear models adjusted for participant characteristics and repeat measures. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess CD16+ NK cell association with chronic lung allograft dysfunction and survival. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid CD16+ NK cell frequency was associated with increasing human leukocyte antigens mismatches and increased AMR grade. Although NK frequencies were similar between DSA+ and DSA- recipients, CD16+ NK cell frequencies were greater in recipients with AMR and those with concomitant allograft dysfunction. CD16+ NK cells were associated with long-term graft dysfunction after AMR and decreased chronic lung allograft dysfunction-free survival. These data support the role of CD16+ NK cells in pulmonary AMR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long Noncoding RNA: A Novel Insight into the Pathogenesis of Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36675533/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), represent an acute stage of lung inflammation where the alveolar epithelium loses its functionality. ALI has a devastating impact on the population as it not only has a high rate of incidence, but also has high rates of morbidity and mortality. Due to the involvement of multiple factors, the pathogenesis of ALI is complex and is not fully understood yet. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of non-protein-coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. Growing evidence has shown that lncRNAs have a decisive role in the pathogenesis of ALI. LncRNAs can either promote or hinder the development of ALI in various cell types in the lungs. Mechanistically, current studies have found that lncRNAs play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of ALI via the regulation of small RNAs (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, microRNAs) or downstream proteins. Undoubtedly, lncRNAs not only have the potential to reveal the underlying mechanisms of ALI pathogenesis but also serve as diagnostic and therapeutic targets for the therapy of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil, neutrophil extracellular traps and endothelial cell dysfunction in sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36629024/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a persistent systemic inflammatory condition involving multiple organ failures resulting from a dysregulated immune response to infection, and one of the hallmarks of sepsis is endothelial dysfunction. During its progression, neutrophils are the first line of innate immune defence against infection. Aside from traditional mechanisms, such as phagocytosis or the release of inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species and other antibacterial substances, activated neutrophils also release web-like structures composed of tangled decondensed DNA, histone, myeloperoxidase and other granules called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which can efficiently ensnare bacteria in the circulation. In contrast, excessive neutrophil activation and NET release may induce endothelial cells to shift toward a pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant phenotype. Furthermore, neutrophils and NETs can degrade glycocalyx on the endothelial cell surface and increase endothelium permeability. Consequently, the endothelial barrier collapses, contributing to impaired microcirculatory blood flow, tissue hypoperfusion and life-threatening organ failure in the late phase of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B inhibits the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B prevents the production of ROS and reduced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B alleviates pulmonary edema, reverses inflammatory mediator TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-β secretion in lung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a devastating respiratory disorder characterized by rapid alveolar injury, uncontrolled inflammatory response, etc. Onychiol B is a cyathane diterpene originally isolated from fern plants. In this study, onychiol B can inhibit the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as NO, iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells by restraining the NF-κB and the p38 MAPK pathway. In addition, it prevents the production of ROS and reduces the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, in the acute lung injury mouse model induced by LPS injected into the trachea, onychiol B alleviates pulmonary edema, reverses inflammatory mediator TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-β secretion in lung. In general, our data show that significant anti-ALI effects of onychiol B would render it a potential candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective countermeasures for tendon injury remains unsatisfactory. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs)-based therapy via regulation of Mφ-mediated angiogenesis has emerged as a promising strategy for tissue regeneration. Still, approaches to tailor the functions of EVs to treat tendon injuries have been limited. We reported a novel strategy by applying MSC-EVs boosted with bioactive glasses (BG). BG-elicited EVs (EVB) showed up-regulation of medicinal miRNAs, including miR-199b-3p and miR-125a-5p, which play a pivotal role in M2 Mφ-mediated angiogenesis. EVB accelerated angiogenesis via the reprogrammed anti-inflammatory M2 Mφs compared with naïve MSC-EVs (EVN). In rodent Achilles tendon rupture model, EVB local administration activated anti-inflammatory responses via M2 polarization and led to a spatial correlation between M2 Mφs and newly formed blood vessels. Our results showed that EVB outperformed EVN in promoting tenogenesis and in reducing detrimental morphological changes without causing heterotopic ossification. Biomechanical test revealed that EVB significantly improved ultimate load, stiffness, and tensile modulus of the repaired tendon, along with a positive correlation between M2/M1 ratio and biomechanical properties. On the basis of the boosted nature to reprogram regenerative microenvironment, EVB holds considerable potential to be developed as a next-generation therapeutic modality for enhancing functional regeneration to achieve satisfying tendon regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gestational diabetes is driven by microbiota-induced inflammation months before diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36627187/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition in which women without diabetes are diagnosed with glucose intolerance during pregnancy, typically in the second or third trimester. Early diagnosis, along with a better understanding of its pathophysiology during the first trimester of pregnancy, may be effective in reducing incidence and associated short-term and long-term morbidities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design:&lt;/em&gt; We comprehensively profiled the gut microbiome, metabolome, inflammatory cytokines, nutrition and clinical records of 394 women during the first trimester of pregnancy, before GDM diagnosis. We then built a model that can predict GDM onset weeks before it is typically diagnosed. Further, we demonstrated the role of the microbiome in disease using faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) of first trimester samples from pregnant women across three unique cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in women who later developed GDM, decreased faecal short-chain fatty acids and altered microbiome. We next confirmed that differences in GDM-associated microbial composition during the first trimester drove inflammation and insulin resistance more than 10 weeks prior to GDM diagnosis using FMT experiments. Following these observations, we used a machine learning approach to predict GDM based on first trimester clinical, microbial and inflammatory markers with high accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; GDM onset can be identified in the first trimester of pregnancy, earlier than currently accepted. Furthermore, the gut microbiome appears to play a role in inflammation-induced GDM pathogenesis, with interleukin-6 as a potential contributor to pathogenesis. Potential GDM markers, including microbiota, can serve as targets for early diagnostics and therapeutic intervention leading to prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tabersonine, a natural NLRP3 inhibitor, suppresses inflammasome activation in macrophages and attenuate NLRP3-driven diseases in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberrant activation of NLRP3 inflammasome causes the progression of various inflammation-related diseases, but the small-molecule inhibitors of NLRP3 are not currently available for clinical use. Tabersonine (Tab) is a natural product derived from a traditional Chinese herb Catharanthus roseus that is usually used as an anti-tumor agent. In this study we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects and molecular targets of Tab. We first screened 151 in-house natural compounds for their inhibitory activity against IL-1β production in BMDMs. We found that Tab potently inhibited NLRP3-mediated IL-1β production with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 0.71 μM. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Tab suppressed the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome, especially the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC. Interestingly, we found that Tab directly bound to NLRP3 NACHT domain, thereby reducing the self-oligomerization of NLRP3. In addition, we showed that administration of Tab significantly ameliorated NLRP3-driven diseases, such as peritonitis, acute lung injury, and sepsis in mouse models. The preventive effects of Tab were not observed in the models of NLRP3 knockout mouse. In conclusion, we have identified Tab as a natural NLRP3 inhibitor and a lead compound for the design and discovery of novel NLRP3 inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The main e-cigarette component vegetable glycerin enhances neutrophil migration and fibrosis in endotoxin-induced lung injury via p38 MAPK activation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the effects of vegetable glycerin (VG), a main e-cigarette constituent, on endotoxin-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Mice received intratracheal administration of 30% VG in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vehicle or only PBS (control) for 4 days. On Day 5, mice received an intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (LPS group and VG + LPS group) or PBS (VG group and control group). Lung histopathology, expression of chemokine receptors, and regulatory signaling were analyzed 24 h after the Day 5 treatment. VG significantly increased ALI-associated histopathological and fibrotic changes in both the VG group and LPS-induced ALI mice (VG + LPS group). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analyses revealed that VG administration resulted in upregulation of neutrophil markers [lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus G6D (Ly6G) and myeloperoxidase (MPO)] as well as upregulation of the expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a central mediator of fibrogenesis, in the lungs of both VG and VG + LPS groups. VG enhanced the expression of adhesion molecules [very late antigen 4 (VLA-4) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)] and increased activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) to prompt neutrophil recruitment in the lungs of mice with ALI. Intraperitoneal administration of a p38 inhibitor attenuated these histopathological changes significantly as well as VG-induced upregulation in expression of Ly6G, MPO, VLA-4, VCAM-1, TGF-β, and collagen-1 in mice with ALI. In conclusion, VG enhances neutrophil chemotaxis and fibrosis and it amplifies the inflammatory response associated with LPS-induced ALI in the lungs via enhancement of p38 MAPK activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tissue resident iNKT17 cells facilitate cancer cell extravasation in liver metastasis via interleukin-22</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Il22&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice are protected against metastasis formation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-22 neutralization blocks cancer cell extravasation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-22 acts on endothelial cells, promoting cancer cell extravasation via ANPEP induction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tissue resident iNKT17 cells are the key IL-22 source during cancer cell extravasation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During metastasis, cancer cells invade, intravasate, enter the circulation, extravasate, and colonize target organs. Here, we examined the role of interleukin (IL)-22 in metastasis. Immune cell-derived IL-22 acts on epithelial tissues, promoting regeneration and healing upon tissue damage, but it is also associated with malignancy. &lt;em&gt;Il22&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice and mice treated with an IL-22 antibody were protected from colon-cancer-derived liver and lung metastasis formation, while overexpression of IL-22 promoted metastasis. Mechanistically, IL-22 acted on endothelial cells, promoting endothelial permeability and cancer cell transmigration via induction of endothelial aminopeptidase N. Multi-parameter flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing of immune cells isolated during cancer cell extravasation into the liver revealed iNKT17 cells as source of IL-22. iNKT-cell-deficient mice exhibited reduced metastases, which was reversed by injection of wild type, but not &lt;em&gt;Il22&lt;/em&gt;-deficient, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells. IL-22-producing iNKT cells promoting metastasis were tissue resident, as demonstrated by parabiosis. Thus, IL-22 may present a therapeutic target for prevention of metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of innate immune cGAS-STING pathway contributes to Alzheimer’s pathogenesis in 5×FAD mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cGAS senses microbial and host-derived double-stranded DNA in cytoplasm to trigger cellular innate immune response in a STING-dependent manner; however, it remains unknown whether the cGAS-STING pathway in innate immunity contributes to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here we demonstrated the detectable binding of the cGAS double-stranded DNA in cytoplasm and the activation of the microglial cGAS-STING pathway in brains of human AD and aged mice. &lt;em&gt;Cgas&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; 5×FAD mice were largely protected from cognitive impairment, amyloid-β pathology, neuroinflammation and other sequelae associated with AD. Furthermore, &lt;em&gt;Cgas&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in microglia inhibited a neurotoxic A1 astrocytic phenotype and thus alleviated oligomeric amyloid-β peptide-induced neurotoxicity. Finally, administration of STING inhibitor H-151 potently suppressed the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and ameliorated AD pathogenesis in 5×FAD mice. In conclusion, our present study has identified a critical molecular link between innate immunity and AD and suggests that therapeutic targeting of the cGAS-STING pathway activity might effectively interfere with the progression of AD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of short-term high-concentration exposure to PM2.5 on pulmonary tissue damage and repair ability as well as innate immune events</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36632972/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-term heavy air pollution still occurs frequently worldwide, especially during the winter heating period in some developing countries, which is usually accompanied by the temporary explosive growth of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;. The pulmonary damage caused by PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure has been determined, but there have been few studies on the repair ability after the cessation of exposure and the important role of innate immune events. This study established a short-term (30 days) high-concentration (15 mg/kg body weight) PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure and recovery (15 days of exposure cessation) model by intratracheal instillation. The results showed that short-term PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure increased the content of collagen fiber in rat lung tissue, which was significantly repaired after recovery by 15 days of exposure cessation. Meanwhile, exposure to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; also caused changes in lung epithelial function, macrophage polarization and cell autophagy function. Most of these changes could be restored or reversed to a certain extent after recovery. However, there were also some biomarkers, including CLDN18.1, SP-A, SP-D, iNOS, CD206, Beclin1, p62 and LC3B, that were still significantly different between the exposure and control groups after recovery, suggesting that some toxic effects, especially epithelial function damage, were not completely repaired. In addition, there was a significant correlation between pulmonary fibrosis and innate immunity. The present study demonstrated that short-term high-concentration exposure to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; could cause temporary lung tissue damage and related innate immune events in rats, and the repair ability existed after the cessation of exposure, but part of the damage that required special attention still persisted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cationic phosphorus dendron nanomicelles deliver microRNA mimics and microRNA inhibitors for enhanced anti-inflammatory therapy of acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient nanomedicines to repress the repolarization of M1 phenotype macrophages and therefore inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression for anti-inflammatory therapy is still a challenging task. We report here an original gene delivery nanoplatform based on pyrrolidinium-modified amphiphilic generation 1 phosphorus dendron (C12G1) nanomicelles with a rigid phosphorous dendron structure. The nanomicelles display higher gene delivery efficiency than the counterpart materials of pyrrolidinium-modified G1 phosphorus dendrimers, and meanwhile exhibit excellent cytocompatibility. The C12G1 nanomicelles can be employed to co-deliver the miRNA-146a mimic (miR-146a mimic) and miRNA-429 inhibitor (miR-429i) to inhibit the Toll-like receptor-4 signaling pathway and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, respectively, thus causing repression of M1 phenotype alveolar macrophage polarization. The developed C12G1/miR-mixture polyplexes enable efficient therapy of lipopolysaccharide-activated alveolar macrophages &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and an acute lung injury mouse model &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. The generated cationic phosphorus dendron nanomicelles may hold promising potential for anti-inflammatory gene therapy of other inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomal miR-27b-3p secreted by visceral adipocytes contributes to endothelial inflammation and atherogenesis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36640325/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obesity increases the level of exosomal miR-27b-3p in gonadal fat and plasma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;miR-27b-3p promote endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis in vitro and in vivo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CDS region of PPARα is the miRNA-recognition elements of miR-27b-3p&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity, particularly increased visceral fat, positively correlates with various metabolic challenges, including atherosclerosis, but the mechanism is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to determine the role of visceral-fat-derived exosomes (Exo) in endothelial cells and atherosclerosis. We show that obesity changes the miRNA profile of visceral adipose exosomes in mice. Importantly, exosomal miR-27b-3p efficiently enters into the vascular endothelial cells and activates the NF-κB pathway by downregulating PPARα. Mechanistically, miR-27b-3p binds directly to the CDS region of PPARα mRNA, thereby promoting mRNA degradation and suppressing translation. In ApoE-deficient mice, administration of miR-27b-3p mimic increases inflammation and atherogenesis, while overexpression of PPARα protects against atherosclerosis. Thus, obesity-induced exosomal miR-27b-3p promotes endothelial inflammation and facilitates atherogenesis by PPARα suppression. We reveal an exosomal pathway by which obesity aggravates atherosclerosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis in people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD44-targeting Drug Delivery System of Exosomes Loading Forsythiaside A Combats Liver Fibrosis via Regulating NLRP3-mediated Pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36603210/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver fibrosis is a progressive pathological process induced by various stimuli and may progress to liver cirrhosis and cancer. Forsythiaside A (FA) is an active ingredient extracted from traditional Chinese medicine Forsythiae Fructus and has prominent hepatoprotective activities. However, the unsatisfactory pharmacokinetic properties restrict its clinical application. In this study, the nanocarrier of CD44-specific ligand Hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified milk-derived exosomes (mExo) encapsulated with FA (HA-mExo-FA) is developed. As a result, HA modification could deliver drug-loaded exosomes to the target cells and form a specific ligand-receptor interaction with CD44, thus improving the anti-liver fibrosis effect of FA. In vitro findings indicate that HA-mExo-FA could inhibit TGF-β1-induced LX2 cell proliferation, reduce α-SMA and collagen gene and protein levels, and promote the apoptosis of activated LX2 cells. In vivo results demonstrate that HA-mExo-FA could improve liver morphology and function changes in zebrafish larvae. The anti-liver fibrosis mechanism of HA-mExo-FA may be attributed to the inhibition of NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis. In addition, the effect of HA-mExo-FA on TAA-induced increase in NLRP3 production is attenuated by NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950. Collectively, this study demonstrates the promising application of HA-mExo-FA in drug delivery with high specificity and provides a powerful and novel delivery platform for liver fibrosis therapy.

      <title>Development of a 32-gene signature using machine learning for accurate prediction of inflammatory bowel disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36600111/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Numerous genes are implicated in the etiology of IBD, but the diagnosis of IBD is challenging. Here, XGBoost, a machine learning prediction model, has been used to distinguish IBD from healthy cases following elaborative feature selection. Using combined unsupervised clustering analysis and the XGBoost feature selection method, we successfully identified a 32-gene signature that can predict IBD occurrence in new cohorts with 0.8651 accuracy. The signature shows enrichment in neutrophil extracellular trap formation and cytokine signaling in the immune system. The probability threshold of the XGBoost-based classification model can be adjusted to fit personalized lifestyle and health status. Therefore, this study reveals potential IBD-related biomarkers that facilitate an effective personalized diagnosis of IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Gut microbiota dysbiosis is closely linked to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We aimed to identify potential probiotic gut microbes that can ameliorate the development of RA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design:&lt;/em&gt; Microbiota profiling in patients with RA and healthy individuals was investigated via 16S rDNA bacterial gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics. Collagen-induced arthritic mice and TNF-α transgenic mice were used to evaluate the roles of the gut commensal &lt;em&gt;Parabacteroides distasonis&lt;/em&gt; in RA. The effects of &lt;em&gt;P. distasonis&lt;/em&gt;-derived microbial metabolites on the differentiation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and macrophage polarisation were also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The relative abundance of &lt;em&gt;P. distasonis&lt;/em&gt; in new-onset patients with RA and patients with RA with history of the disease was downregulated and this decrease was negatively correlated with Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28). Oral treatment of arthritic mice with live &lt;em&gt;P. distasonis&lt;/em&gt; (LPD) considerably ameliorated RA pathogenesis. LPD-derived lithocholic acid (LCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), isolithocholic acid (isoLCA) and 3-oxolithocholic acid (3-oxoLCA) had similar and synergistic effects on the treatment of RA. In addition to directly inhibiting the differentiation of Th17 cells, 3-oxoLCA and isoLCA were identified as TGR5 agonists that promoted the M2 polarisation of macrophages. A specific synthetic inhibitor of bile salt hydrolase attenuated the antiarthritic effects of LPD by reducing the production of these four bile acids. The natural product ginsenoside Rg2 exhibited its anti-RA effects by promoting the growth of &lt;em&gt;P. distasonis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;P. distasonis&lt;/em&gt; and ginsenoside Rg2 might represent probiotic and prebiotic agents in the treatment of RA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>β-adrenoreceptor-triggered PKA activation negatively regulates the innate antiviral response</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon viral infection, cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors detect viral nucleic acids and activate the adaptor protein VISA/MAVS- or MITA/STING-mediated innate antiviral response. Whether and how the innate antiviral response is regulated by neuronal endocrine functions is unclear. Here, we show that viral infection reduced the serum levels of the β-adrenergic hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine as well as the cellular levels of their receptors ADRB1 and ADRB2. We further show that an increase in epinephrine/norepinephrine level inhibited the innate antiviral response in an ADRB1-/2-dependent manner. Mechanistically, epinephrine/norepinephrine stimulation activated the downstream kinase PKA, which catalyzed the phosphorylation of MITA at S241, S243 and T263, inhibiting MITA activation and suppressing the innate immune response to DNA virus. In addition, phosphorylation of VISA at T54 by PKA antagonized the innate immune response to RNA virus. These findings reveal the regulatory mechanisms of innate antiviral responses by epinephrine/norepinephrine and provide a possible explanation for increased host susceptibility to viral infection in stressful and anxiety-promoting situations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Donor and recipient human leukocyte antigen-G polymorphisms modulate the risk of adverse immunologic events following lung transplantation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36695689/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term benefits of lung transplantation (LTx) are limited by pathogenic alloimmune responses that drive injury, inflammation, and chronic dysfunction. Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) plays a key role in the modulation of these pathways. This study assesses the impact of the HLA-G genotype on immunologic risk and survival following LTx. This retrospective cohort study included 289 bilateral LTx. Recipient and donor HLA-G genotypes were analyzed to identify associations with de novo donor-specific antibodies, acute rejection, chronic lung allograft dysfunction, and allograft survival. We further assessed these associations, both individually and in paired analysis, based on a grouped haplotype classification of HLA-G expression. Donor HLA-G single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with allograft injury, the onset of chronic lung allograft dysfunction following injury, and allograft survival. Recipient HLA-G single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with allograft injury, cellular rejection, and donor-specific antibody formation. &amp;ldquo;Low HLA-G expression&amp;rdquo; donor haplotypes were associated with impaired allograft survival, as were &amp;ldquo;low HLA-G expression&amp;rdquo; donor-recipient haplotype pairs. This study provides compelling evidence for the role of HLA-G in modulating immunologic risk after LTx. Our results highlight the importance of both donor and recipient HLA-G genotypes on the overall risk profile and underscore the lasting influence of donor genotype on lung transplant outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metabolic enzyme UAP1 mediates IRF3 pyrophosphorylation to facilitate innate immune response</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36603579/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36603579/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UAP1 is a positive regulator of type I interferon signaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UAP1 catalyzes IRF3 pyrophosphorylation at serine 386&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UAP1 pyrophosphorylates IRF3 at S386 to promote antiviral responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins are crucial to guarantee the proper biological functions in immune responses. Although protein phosphorylation has been extensively studied, our current knowledge of protein pyrophosphorylation, which occurs based on phosphorylation, is very limited. Protein pyrophosphorylation is originally considered to be a non-enzymatic process, and its function in immune signaling is unknown. Here, we identify a metabolic enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1), as a pyrophosphorylase for protein serine pyrophosphorylation, by catalyzing the pyrophosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) at serine (Ser) 386 to promote robust type I interferon (IFN) responses. Uap1 deficiency significantly impairs the activation of both DNA- and RNA-viruse-induced type I IFN pathways, and the Uap1-deficient mice are highly susceptible to lethal viral infection. Our findings demonstrate the function of protein pyrophosphorylation in the regulation of antiviral responses and provide insights into the crosstalk between metabolism and innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rabies virus P protein binds to TBK1 and interferes with the formation of innate immunity-related liquid condensates</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon interferon-inducing signals, TBK1, NAP1, and SINTBAD form liquid condensates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rabies virus phosphoprotein P binds TBK1 to inhibit interferon induction pathways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A change of serine 179 to proline abolishes the P-inhibitory activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutations of TBK1 phosphorylation sites abolish P binding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses must overcome the interferon-mediated antiviral response to replicate and propagate into their host. Rabies virus (RABV) phosphoprotein P is known to inhibit interferon induction. Here, using a global mass spectrometry approach, we show that RABV P binds to TBK1, a kinase located at the crossroads of many interferon induction pathways, resulting in innate immunity inhibition. Mutations of TBK1 phosphorylation sites abolish P binding. Importantly, we demonstrate that upon RABV infection or detection of dsRNA by innate immunity sensors, TBK1 and its adaptor proteins NAP1 and SINTBAD form dynamic cytoplasmic condensates that have liquid properties. These condensates can form larger aggregates having ring-like structures in which NAP1 and TBK1 exhibit locally restricted movement. P binding to TBK1 interferes with the formation of these structures. This work demonstrates that proteins of the signaling pathway leading to interferon induction transiently form liquid organelles that can be targeted by viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL-99 ameliorates colitis-related lung injury in mice by modulating short-chain fatty acid production and inflammatory monocytes/macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36594489/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary inflammation as one of the extraintestinal manifestations of ulcerative colitis (UC) has attracted extensive attention, and its pathogenesis is closely related to gut dysbiosis. &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis&lt;/em&gt; subsp. lactis BL-99 (BL-99) can alleviate osteoporosis caused by UC, but less research has been done on other extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) caused by UC. This study aimed to explore the role and potential mechanisms of BL-99 on DSS-induced pulmonary complications in colitis mice. The results showed that BL-99 decreased weight loss, disease activity index score, colonic pathology score, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in colitis mice. BL-99 also alleviated DSS-induced lung pathological damage by suppressing the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory monocytes, and macrophages. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed lower abundances of several potentially pathogenic bacteria (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Burkholderia, Shigella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/em&gt;) and enrichment in specific beneficial bacteria (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Adlercreutzia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis&lt;/em&gt;) in colitis mice with BL-99 treatment. Targeted metabolomics suggested that BL-99 intervention promoted the production of intestinal acetate and butyrate. Finally, we observed that the pulmonary expression of primary acetate and butyrate receptors, including FFAR2, FFAR3, and, GPR109a, was up-regulated in BL-99-treated mice, which negatively correlated with inflammatory monocytes and macrophages. Altogether, these results suggest that BL-99 might be utilized as a probiotic intervention to prevent the incidence of colitis-related lung injury owing to its ability to shape the intestinal microbiota and suppress inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generation of bioactive MSC-EVs for bone tissue regeneration by tauroursodeoxycholic acid treatment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36586671/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized carriers that reflect the parent cell&amp;rsquo;s information and are known to mediate cell-cell communication. In order to overcome the disadvantages of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in cell therapy, such as unexpected differentiation leading to tumorization, immune rejection, and other side effects, EVs derived from MSCs (MSC-EVs) with the tissue regenerative function have been studied as new cell-free therapeutics. However, therapeutic applications of EVs require overcoming several challenges. First, the production efficiency of MSC-EVs should be increased at least as much as the quantity of them are required to their clinical application; second, MSC-EVs needs to show various functionality further, thereby increasing tissue regeneration efficiency. In this study, we treated tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a biological derivative known to regulate cholesterol, to MSCs and investigated whether TUDCA treatment would be able to increase EV production efficiency and tissue regenerative capacity of EVs. Indeed, it appears that TUDCA priming to MSC increases the yield of MSC-EVs &amp;gt;2 times by reducing the cellular cholesterol level in MSCs and increasing the exocytosis-related CAV1 expression. Interestingly, it was found that the EVs derived from TUDCA-primed MSCs (T-EV) contained higher amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL1RN, IL6, IL10, and IL11) and osteogenic proteins (ALP, RUNX2, BMP2, BMPR1, and BMPR2) than those in control MSC-EVs (C-EV). Besides, it was shown that T-EV not only regulated M1/M2 macrophages differentiation of monocytes, also effectively increased the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs as well as bone tissue regeneration in a bone defect rat model. Based on these results, it is concluded that TUDCA treatment to MSC as a new approach endows EV with high-yield production and functionality. Thus, we strongly believe T-EV would be a powerful therapeutic material for bone tissue regeneration and potentially could be expanded to other types of tissue regeneration for clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Maresin 1-LGR6 axis decreases respiratory syncytial virus-induced lung inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution of infection is an active process with specific molecular and cellular mechanisms that temper inflammation and enhance pathogen clearance. Here, the specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) Maresin 1 (MaR1) inhibited respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced inflammation. inlerleukin-13 production from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC) and CD4 T helper type 2 cells was decreased by exogenous MaR1. In addition, MaR1 increased amphiregulin production and decreased RSV viral transcripts to promote resolution. MaR1 also promoted interferon-β production in mouse lung tissues and also in pediatric lung slices. MaR1 significantly inhibited the RSV-triggered aberrant inflammatory phenotype in FoxP3-expressing Tregs. The receptor for MaR1, leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6), was constitutively expressed on Tregs. Following RSV infection, mice lacking Lgr6 had exacerbated type 2 immune responses with an increased viral burden and blunted responses to MaR1. Together, these findings have uncovered a multi-pronged protective signaling axis for MaR1-Lgr6, improving Tregs&amp;rsquo;s suppressive function and upregulating host antiviral genes resulting in decreased viral burden and pathogen-mediated inflammation, ultimately promoting restoration of airway mucosal homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pathogenicity and virulence of human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) in oncogenesis: adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive malignancy of CD4+ T lymphocytes caused by human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infection. HTLV-1 was brought to the World Health Organization (WHO) and researchers to address its impact on global public health, oncogenicity, and deterioration of the host immune system toward autoimmunity. In a minority of the infected population (3-5%), it can induce inflammatory networks toward HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), or hijacking the infected CD4+ T lymphocytes into T regulatory subpopulation, stimulating anti-inflammatory signaling networks, and prompting ATLL development. This review critically discusses the complex signaling networks in ATLL pathogenesis during virus-host interactions for better interpretation of oncogenicity and introduces the main candidates in the pathogenesis of ATLL. At least two viral factors, HTLV-1 trans-activator protein (TAX) and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), are implicated in ATLL manifestation, interacting with host responses and deregulating cell signaling in favor of infected cell survival and virus dissemination. Such molecules can be used as potential novel biomarkers for ATLL prognosis or targets for therapy. Moreover, the challenging aspects of HTLV-1 oncogenesis introduced in this review could open new venues for further studies on acute leukemia pathogenesis. These features can aid in the discovery of effective immunotherapies when reversing the gene expression profile toward appropriate immune responses gradually becomes attainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; invades cells and persists intracellularly, causing persistent inflammation that is notoriously difficult to treat. Here we investigated host-pathogen interactions underlying intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection in macrophages and discovered that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important cellular compartment for intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Using CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA library screening, we determined that the autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR), an ER-resident E3 ubiquitin ligase, played an essential role in mediating intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;-induced inflammation. AMFR directly interacted with TAK1-binding protein 3 (TAB3) in the ER, inducing K27-linked polyubiquitination of TAB3 on lysine 649 and promoting TAK1 activation. Moreover, the virulence factor γ-haemolysin B (HIgB) of &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; bound to the AMFR and regulated TAB3. Our findings highlight an unknown role of AMFR in intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection-induced pneumonia and suggest that pharmacological interruption of AMFR-mediated TAB3 signalling cascades and HIgB targeting may prevent invasive staphylococci-mediated pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TLE3 and TLE4-coordinated colonic macrophage-CD4&#43; T cell crosstalk maintains intestinal immune homeostasis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colonic macrophages are critical for maintenance of CD4+ T cell homeostasis in intestinal lamina propria. However, the mechanisms by which this process is regulated at the transcriptional level remain unknown. Here, we found that the transcriptional corepressors TLE3 and TLE4, but not TLE1 or TLE2, in colonic macrophages controlled homeostasis of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell pool in colonic lamina propria. Mice lacking TLE3 or TLE4 in myeloid cells exhibited markedly increased numbers of T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells under homeostatic conditions, rendering mice more resistant to experimental colitis. Mechanistically, TLE3 and TLE4 negatively regulated Mmp9 transcription in colonic macrophages. &lt;em&gt;Tle3&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Tle4&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in colonic macrophages resulted in upregulated MMP9 production and thus enhanced latent TGF-β activation, which subsequently led to T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cell expansion. These results advanced our knowledge regarding the intricate crosstalk between the intestinal innate and adaptive immune compartments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SIRT6-regulated macrophage efferocytosis epigenetically controls inflammation resolution of diabetic periodontitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36593966/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Diabetes exacerbates the prevalence and severity of periodontitis, leading to severe periodontal destruction and ultimately tooth loss. Delayed resolution of inflammation is a major contributor to diabetic periodontitis (DP) pathogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms of this imbalanced immune homeostasis remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We collected periodontium from periodontitis with or without diabetes to confirm the dysfunctional neutrophils and macrophages in aggravated inflammatory damage and impaired inflammation resolution. Our in vitro experiments confirmed that SIRT6 inhibited macrophage efferocytosis by restraining miR-216a-5p-216b-5p-217 cluster maturation through &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;non-canonical&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; microprocessor complex (RNA pulldown, RIP, immunostaining, CHIP, Luciferase assays, and FISH). Moreover, we constructed m6SKO mice that underwent LIP-induced periodontitis to explore the in vitro and in vivo effect of SIRT6 on macrophage efferocytosis. Finally, antagomiR-217, a miRNA antagonism, was delivered into the periodontium to treat LIP-induced diabetic periodontitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We discovered that insufficient SIRT6 as a histone deacetylase in macrophages led to unresolved inflammation and aggravated periodontitis in both human and mouse DP with accumulated apoptotic neutrophil (AN) and higher generation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Mechanistically, we validated that macrophage underwent high glucose stimulation resulting in disturbance of the SIRT6-miR-216/217 axis that triggered impeded efferocytosis of AN through targeting the DEL-1/CD36 axis directly. Furthermore, we demonstrated the inhibitory role of SIRT6 for MIR217HG transcription and identified a non-canonical action of microprocessor that SIRT6 epigenetically hindered the splicing of the primary miR-216/217 via the complex of hnRNPA2B1, DGCR8, and Drosha. Notably, by constructing myeloid-specific deletion of SIRT6 mice and locally delivering antagomir-217 in DP models, we strengthened the in vivo effect of this axis in regulating macrophage efferocytosis and inflammation resolution in DP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings delineated the emerging role of SIRT6 in mediating metabolic dysfunction-associated inflammation, and therapeutically targeting this regulatory axis might be a promising strategy for treating diabetes-associated inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The nucleoprotein of influenza A virus inhibits the innate immune response by inducing mitophagy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitophagy is a form of autophagy that plays a key role in maintaining the homeostasis of functional mitochondria in the cell. Viruses have evolved various strategies to manipulate mitophagy to escape host immune responses and promote virus replication. In this study, the nucleoprotein (NP) of H1N1 virus (PR8 strain) was identified as a regulator of mitophagy. We revealed that NP-mediated mitophagy leads to the degradation of the mitochondria-anchored protein MAVS, thereby blocking MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling and promoting virus replication. The NP-mediated mitophagy is dependent on the interaction of NP with MAVS and the cargo receptor TOLLIP. Moreover, Y313 of NP is a key residue for the MAVS-NP interaction and NP-mediated mitophagy. The NPY313F mutation significantly attenuates the virus-induced mitophagy and the virus replication in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings uncover a novel mechanism by which the NP of influenza virus induces mitophagy to attenuate innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Derinat® has an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect on the model of acute lung injury in male SD rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36642990/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simulate acute lung injury (ALI) in SD male rats they we administered intratracheally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by hyperventilation of the lungs (HVL), which lead to functional changes in the respiratory system and an increase in the blood serum concentration of inflammatory cytokines. LPS + HVL after 4 h lead to pronounced histological signs of lung damage. We have studied the effectiveness of Derinat® when administered intramuscularly at dose of 7.5 mg/kg for 8 days in the ALI model. Derinat® administration lead to an increase in the concentration of most of the studied cytokines in a day. In the ALI model the administration of Derinat® returned the concentration of cytokines to its original values already 48 h after LPS + HVL, and also normalized the parameters of pulmonary respiration in comparison with animals without treatment. By the eighth day after LPS + HVL, respiratory parameters and cytokine levels, as well as biochemical and hematological parameters did not differ between groups, while histological signs of residual effects of lung damage were found in all animals, and were more pronounced in Derinat® group, which may indicate stimulation of the local immune response. Thus, the administration of Derinat® stimulates the immune response, has a pronounced protective effect against cytokinemia and respiratory failure caused by ALI, has immunomodulatory effect, and also stimulates a local immune response in lung tissues. Thus, Derinat® is a promising treatment for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interactions of Inhaled Liposome with Macrophages and Neutrophils Determine Particle Biofate and Anti-Inflammatory Effect in Acute Lung Inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36583377/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most current studies have focused on exploring how phagocyte internalization of drug-loaded nanovesicles by macrophages would affect the function and therapeutic effects of infiltrated neutrophils or monocytes, research has evaluated the specificity of the inhaled nanovesicles for targeting various phagocytes subpopulations. In this study, liposomes with various charges (including neutral (L1), anionic (L2), and cationic at inflammatory sites (L3)) were constructed to investigate how particle charge determined their interactions with key phagocytes (including macrophages and neutrophils) in acute lung injury (ALI) models and to establish correlations with their biofate and overall anti-inflammatory effect. Our results clearly indicated that neutrophils were capable of rapidly sequestering L3 with a 3.2-fold increase in the cellular liposome distribution, compared to that in AMs, while 70.5% of L2 were preferentially uptaken by alveolar macrophages (AMs). Furthermore, both AMs and the infiltrated neutrophils performed as the potential vesicles for the inhaled liposomes to prolong their lung retention in ALI models, whereas AMs function as sweepers to recognize and process liposomes in the healthy lung. Finally, inhaled roflumilast-loaded macrophage or neutrophil preferential liposomes (L2 or L3) exhibited optimal anti-inflammatory effect because of the decreased AMs phagocytic capacity or the prolonged circulation times of neutrophils. Such findings will be beneficial in exploiting a potential pathway to specifically manipulate lung phagocyte functions in lung inflammatory diseases where these cells play crucial roles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lycopene Attenuates Di(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate-Induced Mitochondrial Damage and Inflammation in Kidney via cGAS-STING Signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36583613/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a highly harmful and persistent environmental pollutant. Due to its unique chemical composition, it frequently dissolves and enters the environment to endanger human and animal health. Lycopene is a natural bioactive component that can potentially reduce the risk of environmental factor-induced chronic diseases. The present study sought to explore the role and underlying mechanism of lycopene (LYC) on DEHP-induced renal inflammatory response and apoptosis. In this study, mice were orally treated with LYC (5 mg/kg BW/day) and/or DEHP (500 or 1000 mg/kg BW/day) for 28 days. Our results indicated that LYC prevented DEHP-induced histopathological alterations and ultrastructural injuries, including decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), PINK1/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy, and mitochondrial energetic deficit. When damaged mitochondria release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into cytosol, LYC can alleviate inflammation and apoptosis caused by DEHP exposure by activating the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS-STING) signal pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrate that LYC can reduce mitophagy caused by DEHP exposure by activating the PINK1/Parkin pathway and then reduce renal inflammation and apoptosis through the cGAS-STING pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Palmitoylation prevents sustained inflammation by limiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation through chaperone-mediated autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36586411/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palmitoylation of NLRP3 at C844 is critical for preventing inflammasome activation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zDHHC12 directly palmitoylates NLRP3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zDHHC12 enhances NLRP3 degradation through CMA pathway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defective NLRP3 palmitoylation is associated with inflammatory diseases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a key component of the inflammasome, NLRP3 is a critical intracellular danger sensor emerging as an important clinical target in inflammatory diseases. However, little is known about the mechanisms that determine the kinetics of NLRP3 inflammasome stability and activity to ensure effective and controllable inflammatory responses. Here, we show that S-palmitoylation acts as a brake to turn NLRP3 inflammasome off. zDHHC12 is identified as the S-acyltransferase for NLRP3 palmitoylation, which promotes its degradation through the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway. Zdhhc12 deficiency in mice enhances inflammatory symptoms and lethality following alum-induced peritonitis and LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Notably, several disease-associated mutations in NLRP3 are associated with defective palmitoylation, resulting in overt NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, our findings identify zDHHC12 as a repressor of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and uncover a previously unknown regulatory mechanism by which the inflammasome pathway is tightly controlled by the dynamic palmitoylation of NLRP3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a severe clinical syndrome marked by drastic elevation of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Despite the current empirical therapeutic strategies, prediction of CRS onset and identification of high-risk individuals are not satisfactory due to poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying CRS-related immune dysfunction and risk factors for CRS. Recent studies have suggested that conditions such as stress, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension may contribute to the development of CRS. Here, we discuss potential connections between these conditions and CRS pathogenesis, with a focus on stress hormone catecholamine-mediated effects, hoping that the design of CRS therapeutic approaches ensues from a renewed perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The lncRNA LUCAT1 is elevated in inflammatory disease and restrains inflammation by regulating the splicing and stability of NR4A2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36577072/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36577072/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abundant in the human genome, yet, in contrast to proteins, only a small portion of lncRNAs have been functionally characterized. We further explore the molecular basis of LUCAT1-dependent regulation of the inflammatory response. In this study, we identify LUCAT1-binding proteins that are involved in splicing and processing of mRNAs including the anti-inflammatory NR4A2. LUCAT1 regulates splicing and stability of NR4A2 which contributes to the inhibitory effect of LUCAT1 on interferons and inflammatory cytokines. Finally, data from COPD and IBD patients indicate that LUCAT1 levels are elevated in these patient groups where expression is positively correlated with disease severity. Thus, LUCAT1 may serve as a diagnostic marker for inflammation and as a therapeutic target in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nuclear long non-coding RNA LUCAT1 has previously been identified as a negative feedback regulator of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine expression in human myeloid cells. Here, we define the mechanistic basis for the suppression of inflammatory gene expression by LUCAT1. Using comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry as well as RNA immunoprecipitation, we identified proteins important in processing and alternative splicing of mRNAs as LUCAT1-binding proteins. These included heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C, M, and A2B1. Consistent with this finding, cells lacking LUCAT1 have altered splicing of selected immune genes. In particular, upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation, the splicing of the nuclear receptor 4A2 (NR4A2) gene was particularly affected. As a consequence, expression of NR4A2 was reduced and delayed in cells lacking LUCAT1. NR4A2-deficient cells had elevated expression of immune genes. These observations suggest that LUCAT1 is induced to control the splicing and stability of NR4A2, which is in part responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of LUCAT1. Furthermore, we analyzed a large cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease as well as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In these patients, LUCAT1 levels were elevated and in both diseases, positively correlated with disease severity. Collectively, these studies define a key molecular mechanism of LUCAT1-dependent immune regulation through post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs highlighting its role in the regulation of inflammatory disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;i-ROBOT has a replaceable biomarker-sensing element, creating a broad platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid advances in synthetic biology have fueled interest in engineered microorganisms that can diagnose and treat disease. However, designing bacteria that detect dynamic disease-associated biomarkers that then drive treatment remains difficult. Here, we have developed an engineered probiotic that noninvasively monitors and records inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) occurrence and progression in real time and can release treatments via a self-tunable mechanism in response to these biomarkers. These intelligent responsive bacteria for diagnosis and therapy (i-ROBOT) consists of E. coli Nissle 1917 that responds to levels of the inflammatory marker thiosulfate by activating a base-editing system to generate a heritable genomic DNA sequence as well as producing a colorimetric signal. Fluctuations in thiosulfate also drive the tunable release of the immunomodulator AvCystatin. Orally administering i-ROBOT to mice with colitis generated molecular recording signals in processed fecal and colon samples and effectively ameliorated disease. i-ROBOT provides a promising paradigm for gastrointestinal and other metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-33-ST2 pathway regulates AECII transdifferentiation by targeting alveolar macrophage in a bronchopulmonary dysplasia mouse model</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence points to the indispensable function of alveolar macrophages (AMs) in normal lung development and tissue homeostasis. However, the importance of AMs in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not been elucidated. Here, we identified a significant role of abnormal AM proliferation and polarization in alveolar dysplasia during BPD, which is closely related to the activation of the IL-33-ST2 pathway. Compared with the control BPD group, AMs depletion partially abolished the epithelialmesenchymal transition process of AECII and alleviated pulmonary differentiation arrest. In addition, IL-33 or ST2 knockdown has protective effects against lung injury after hyperoxia, which is associated with reduced AM polarization and proliferation. The protective effect disappeared following reconstitution of AMs in injured IL-33 knockdown mice, and the differentiation of lung epithelium was blocked again. In conclusion, the IL-33-ST2 pathway regulates AECII transdifferentiation by targeting AMs proliferation and polarization in BPD, which shows a novel strategy for manipulating the IL-33-ST2-AMs axis for the diagnosis and intervention of BPD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oral Delivery of siRNA Using Fluorinated, Small-Sized Nanocapsules Toward Anti-Inflammation Treatment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36574636/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral delivery of siRNA provides a promising paradigm for treating diseases that require regular injections. However, the multiple gastrointestinal and systemic barriers often lead to inefficient oral absorption and low bioavailability of siRNA. Technologies that can overcome these barriers are still lacking, which hurdles the clinical potential of orally delivered siRNA. Herein, small-sized, fluorinated nanocapsules (F-NCs) were developed to mediate efficient oral delivery of TNF-α siRNA for anti-inflammation treatment. The NCs possessed a disulfide-cross-linked shell structure, thus featuring robust stability in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of their small size (∼30 nm) and fluorocarbon-assisted repelling of mucin adsorption, the best-performing F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NCs showed excellent mucus penetration and intestinal transport capabilities without impairing the intestinal tight junction, conferring the oral bioavailability of 20.4% in relative to i.v. injection. The disulfide cross-linker could be cleaved inside target cells, causing NCs dissociation and siRNA release to potentiate the TNF-α silencing efficiency. In murine models of acute and chronic inflammation, orally delivered F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NCs provoked efficient TNF-α silencing and pronounced anti-inflammatory efficacies. This study therefore provides a transformative strategy for oral siRNA delivery, and would render promising utilities for anti-inflammation treatment. This article is protected by copyright.

      <title>Dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and preventing susceptible patients from lethal infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but have proven to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity. A combination of checkpoint blocking antibody and virus-specific antigen is covalently conjugated to polydopamine nanoparticles, which can be anchored onto bacterial surface, by a one-step in-situ polymerization of dopamine under a cell-friendly condition. By virtue of the ability to colonize and penetrate deep tumor tissue, dressed bacteria enable sustained release and expanded exposure of carried immunoactivators to stimulate immune cells. In addition to a carrier role, bacteria are able to further provoke innate immunity due to native immunogenicity of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Immunization with dressed bacteria promote the maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells, which induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in tumor-bearing mice. As evidenced by efficient production of viral antigen-specific immunoglobulin G antibody in serum and significantly suppressed tumor growth in different models, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface paves an avenue to prepare next-generation therapeutics for synergistic treatment and prevention.

      <title>Chimeric efferocytic receptors improve apoptotic cell clearance and alleviate inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design of chimeric receptors for efferocytosis (CHEF) to enhance efferocytosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boosting efferocytosis via CHEF attenuates multiple inflammatory insults &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protein folding and misfolded protein degradation are rate-limiting steps in efferocytosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHEF expression can improve outcomes in ongoing disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies turn over billions of cells daily via apoptosis and are in turn cleared by phagocytes via the process of &amp;ldquo;efferocytosis.&amp;rdquo; Defects in efferocytosis are now linked to various inflammatory diseases. Here, we designed a strategy to boost efferocytosis, denoted &amp;ldquo;chimeric receptor for efferocytosis&amp;rdquo; (CHEF). We fused a specific signaling domain within the cytoplasmic adapter protein ELMO1 to the extracellular phosphatidylserine recognition domains of the efferocytic receptors BAI1 or TIM4, generating BELMO and TELMO, respectively. CHEF-expressing phagocytes display a striking increase in efferocytosis. In mouse models of inflammation, BELMO expression attenuates colitis, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. In mechanistic studies, BELMO increases ER-resident enzymes and chaperones to overcome protein-folding-associated toxicity, which was further validated in a model of ER-stress-induced renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Finally, TELMO introduction after onset of kidney injury significantly reduced fibrosis. Collectively, these data advance a concept of chimeric efferocytic receptors to boost efferocytosis and dampen inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-cell transcriptomics has allowed unprecedented resolution of cell types/states in the human lung, but their spatial context is less well defined. To (re)define tissue architecture of lung and airways, we profiled five proximal-to-distal locations of healthy human lungs in depth using multi-omic single cell/nuclei and spatial transcriptomics at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lungcellatlas.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lung Cell Atlas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Using computational data integration and analysis, we extend beyond the suspension cell paradigm and discover macro and micro-anatomical tissue compartments including previously unannotated cell types in the epithelial, vascular, stromal and nerve bundle micro-environments. We identify and implicate peribronchial fibroblasts in lung disease. Importantly, we discover and validate a survival niche for IgA plasma cells in the airway submucosal glands (SMG). We show that gland epithelial cells recruit B cells and IgA plasma cells, and promote longevity and antibody secretion locally through expression of CCL28, APRIL and IL-6. This new ‘gland-associated immune niche’ has implications for respiratory health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomes as biomarkers and therapeutic delivery for autoimmune diseases: Opportunities and challenges</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes are spherical lipid bilayer vesicles composed of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids that deliver signaling molecules through a vesicular transport system to regulate the function and morphology of target cells, thereby involving in a variety of biological processes, such as cell apoptosis or proliferation, and cytokine production. In the past decades, there are emerging evidence that exosomes play pivotal roles in the pathological mechanisms of several autoimmune diseases (ADs), including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), Sjogren&amp;rsquo;s syndrome (SS), multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). systemic sclerosis (SSc), etc. Several publications have shown that exosomes are involved in the pathogenesis of ADs mainly through intercellular communication and by influencing the response of immune cells. The level of exosomes and the expression of nucleic acids can reflect the degree of disease progression and are excellent biomarkers for ADs. In addition, exosomes have the potential to be used as drug carriers thanks to their biocompatibility and stability. In this review, we briefly summarized the current researches regarding the biological functions of exosomes in ADs, and provided an insight into the potential of exosomes as biomarkers and therapeutic delivery for these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R-loops are RNA–DNA-hybrid-containing nucleic acids with important cellular roles. Deregulation of R-loop dynamics can lead to DNA damage and genome instability, which has been linked to the action of endonucleases such as XPG. However, the mechanisms and cellular consequences of such processing have remained unclear. Here we identify a new population of RNA–DNA hybrids in the cytoplasm that are R-loop-processing products. When nuclear R-loops were perturbed by depleting the RNA–DNA helicase senataxin (SETX) or the breast cancer gene BRCA1, we observed XPG- and XPF-dependent cytoplasmic hybrid formation. We identify their source as a subset of stable, overlapping nuclear hybrids with a specific nucleotide signature. Cytoplasmic hybrids bind to the pattern recognition receptors cGAS and TLR3, activating IRF3 and inducing apoptosis. Excised hybrids and an R-loop-induced innate immune response were also observed in SETX-mutated cells from patients with ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 and in BRCA1-mutated cancer cells. These findings establish RNA–DNA hybrids as immunogenic species that aberrantly accumulate in the cytoplasm after R-loop processing, linking R-loop accumulation to cell death through the innate immune response. Aberrant R-loop processing and subsequent innate immune activation may contribute to many diseases, such as neurodegeneration and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The transcription factor Fosl1 preserves Klotho expression and protects from acute kidney injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased expression of AP-1 transcription factor components has been reported in acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the role of specific components, such as Fosl1, in tubular cells or AKI is unknown. Upstream regulator analysis of murine nephrotoxic AKI transcriptomics identified AP-1 as highly upregulated. Among AP-1 canonical components, Fosl1 was found to be upregulated in two transcriptomics datasets from nephrotoxic murine AKI induced by folic acid or cisplatin and from proximal tubular cells exposed to TWEAK, a cytokine mediator of AKI. Fosl1 was minimally expressed in the kidneys of control uninjured mice. Increased Fosl1 protein was localized to proximal tubular cell nuclei in AKI. In human AKI, FOSL1 was found present in proximal tubular cells in kidney sections and in urine along with increased urinary FOSL1 mRNA. Selective Fosl1 deficiency in proximal tubular cells (Fosl1Δtub) increased the severity of murine cisplatin- or folate-induced AKI as characterized by lower kidney function, more severe kidney inflammation and Klotho downregulation. Indeed, elevated AP-1 activity was observed after cisplatin-induced AKI in Fosl1Δtub mice compared to wild type mice. More severe Klotho downregulation preceded more severe kidney dysfunction. The Klotho promoter was enriched in Fosl1 binding sites and Fosl1 bound to the Klotho promoter in cisplatin-AKI. In cultured proximal tubular cells, Fosl1 targeting increased the proinflammatory response and downregulated Klotho. In vivo, recombinant Klotho administration protected Fosl1Δtub mice from cisplatin-AKI. Thus, increased proximal tubular Fosl1 expression during AKI is an adaptive response, preserves Klotho. and limits the severity of tubular cell injury and AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chronic exposure to synthetic food colorant Allura Red AC promotes susceptibility to experimental colitis via intestinal serotonin in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36539404/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemicals in food are widely used leading to significant human exposure. Allura Red AC (AR) is a highly common synthetic colorant; however, little is known about its impact on colitis. Here, we show chronic exposure of AR at a dose found in commonly consumed dietary products exacerbates experimental models of colitis in mice. While intermittent exposure is more akin to a typical human exposure, intermittent exposure to AR in mice for 12 weeks, does not influence susceptibility to colitis. However, exposure to AR during early life primes mice to heightened susceptibility to colitis. In addition, chronic exposure to AR induces mild colitis, which is associated with elevated colonic serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) levels and impairment of the epithelial barrier function via myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Importantly, chronic exposure to AR does not influence colitis susceptibility in mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), the rate limiting enzyme for 5-HT biosynthesis. Cecal transfer of the perturbed gut microbiota by AR exposure worsens colitis severity in the recipient germ-free (GF) mice. Furthermore, chronic AR exposure elevates colonic 5-HT levels in naïve GF mice. Though it remains unknown whether AR has similar effects in humans, our study reveals that chronic long-term exposure to a common synthetic colorant promotes experimental colitis via colonic 5-HT in gut microbiota-dependent and -independent pathway in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Degradation of HDAC10 by autophagy promotes IRF3-mediated antiviral innate immune responses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in immunity and inflammation. Through functional screening, we identified HDAC10 as an inhibitor of the type I interferon (IFN) response mediated by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). HDAC10 abundance was decreased in mouse macrophages in response to innate immune stimuli and was reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared with that in PBMCs from healthy donors. Deficiency in HDAC10 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in mice promoted the expression of genes encoding type I IFNs and of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), leading to enhanced antiviral responses in vitro and in vivo. HDAC10 bound in a deacetylase-independent manner to IRF3 in uninfected cells to inhibit the phosphorylation of IRF3 at Ser&lt;sup&gt;396&lt;/sup&gt; by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Upon viral infection, HDAC10 was targeted for autophagy-mediated degradation through its interaction with LC3-II. Consequently, IRF3 phosphorylation was increased, which resulted in enhanced type I IFN production and antiviral responses. Our findings identify a potential target for improving host defense responses against pathogen infection and for treating autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PI3K/AKT-mediated autophagy inhibition facilitates mast cell activation to enhance severe inflammatory lung injury in influenza A virus- and secondary Staphylococcus aureus-infected mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality each year globally, and secondary bacterial infection further exacerbates the severity and fatality of the initial viral infection. Mast cells have substantial roles in protecting the respiratory tract mucosa, while their role in viral and bacterial co-infection remains unclear. The present study revealed that secondary Staphylococcus aureus infection significantly aggravated the activation of mast cells during the initial H1N1 infection both in vivo and in vitro, which was closely related to the increased inflammatory lung injury and mortality. Meanwhile, the secondary S. aureus infection suppressed autophagy and promoted inflammatory mediators released by mast cells through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Blocking PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation, could rescue autophagy and inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, based on the influenza A viral and secondary bacterial infected mice model, we showed that the combination of LY294002 and antiviral drug oseltamivir could effectively reduce the inflammatory damage and pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing in lungs, recovering body weight loss and improving the survival rate from the co-infections. In conclusion, secondary bacterial infection can inhibit autophagy and stimulate mast cell activation through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which might explain why secondary bacterial infection would cause severe and fatal consequences following an initial influenza A viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polystyrene microplastics significantly facilitate influenza A virus infection of host cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microplastics (MPs) are emerging pollutants which exist in various environments and pose a potential threat to human health. However, the effect of MP on respiratory pathogens-infected organisms is unknown. In order to explore the effect of MP on respiratory pathogen infection, we studied the effect of polystyrene microplastics (PS) on influenza A virus (IAV)-infected A549 cells. Western blot, qPCR, and viral plaque assay demonstrated that PS could promote IAV infection. Further study by bioluminescence imaging showed that a large number of IAV could be enriched on PS and entered cells through endocytosis. Meanwhile, the expression of IFITM3 in cells was significantly reduced. In addition, our results showed that PS down-regulated IRF3 and its active form P-IRF3 by down-regulating RIG-I and inhibiting TBK1 phosphorylation activation, which then significantly reduced IFN-β expression and affected the cellular innate antiviral immune system. Taken together, our results indicate the potential threat of MPs to respiratory diseases caused by IAV and provide new insights into human health protection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selective depletion of CD11b-positive monocytes/macrophages potently suppresses bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36700767/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease without effective treatments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD11B-positive monocytes/macrophages increase in the fibrotic lungs and is correlated with pulmonary fibrosis progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD11b conditional depletion suppresses bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD11b contributes to pulmonary fibrosis via altering macrophages polarization and the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2)-sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) signaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD11b may represent a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The understanding of pathogenesis underlying idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is still limited presently. Monocytes or macrophages are involved in progression of the pulmonary injury and repair. The aim of this study is to investigate the roles of CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes/macrophages in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, the expression levels of CD11B gene and inflammatory genes in the IPF patients are evaluated using the available datasets. CD11b cells are conditionally depleted in a CD11b-diptheria toxin receptor (CD11b-DTR) mouse by administration of diptheria toxin (DT). Pulmonary fibrosis in mice is induced using intranasalbleomycin. The mRNAs and proteins expression in lung tissues are determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence (IF) staining and Western-blot assays. It shows that the expression of CD11B mRNA is up-regulated in fibrotic lungs and alveolar macrophages of IPF patients and bleomycin-treated rodents. Selective depletion of CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes/macrophages in CD11b-DTR mice potently halts bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis progression. CD11b depletion inhibits the polarization of macrophages in the fibrotic lungs. Mechanically, CD11b deficiency represses the activation of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2)/sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) signaling during pulmonary fibrosis. In conclusion, our data suggest that CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes/macrophages contribute to pulmonary fibrosis and represent a potential therapeutic target for IPF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting the transcription factor HES1 by L-menthol restores protein phosphatase 6 in keratinocytes in models of psoriasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36535970/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein Phosphatase 6 down-regulation in keratinocytes is a pivotal event that amplifies the inflammatory circuits in psoriasis, indicating that restoration of protein phosphatase 6 can be a rational strategy for psoriasis treatment. Through the phenotypic screen, we here identify L-menthol that ameliorates psoriasis-like skin inflammation by increasing protein phosphatase 6 in keratinocytes. Target identification approaches reveal an indispensable role for the transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1 in governing the protein phosphatase 6-upregulating function of L-menthol in keratinocytes. The transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1 is diminished in the epidermis of psoriasis patients and imiquimod-induced mouse model, while L-menthol upregulates the transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1 by preventing its proteasomal degradation. Mechanistically, the transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1 transcriptionally activates the expression of immunoglobulin-binding protein 1 which promotes protein phosphatase 6 expression and inhibits its ubiquitination. Collectively, we discover a therapeutic compound, L-menthol, for psoriasis, and uncover the dysfunctional the transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1- immunoglobulin-binding protein 1- protein phosphatase 6 axis that contributes to psoriasis pathology by using L-menthol as a probe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crosstalk between mitophagy and innate immunity in viral infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are important organelles involved in cell metabolism and programmed cell death in eukaryotic cells and are closely related to the innate immunity of host cells against viruses. Mitophagy is a process in which phagosomes selectively phagocytize damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria to form autophagosomes and is degraded by lysosomes, which control mitochondrial mass and maintain mitochondrial dynamics and cellular homeostasis. Innate immunity is an important part of the immune system and plays a vital role in eliminating viruses. Viral infection causes many physiological and pathological alterations in host cells, including mitophagy and innate immune pathways. Accumulating evidence suggests that some virus promote self-replication through regulating mitophagy-mediated innate immunity. Clarifying the regulatory relationships among mitochondria, mitophagy, innate immunity, and viral infection will shed new insight for pathogenic mechanisms and antiviral strategies. This review systemically summarizes the activation pathways of mitophagy and the relationship between mitochondria and innate immune signaling pathways, and then discusses the mechanisms of viruses on mitophagy and innate immunity and how viruses promote self-replication by regulating mitophagy-mediated innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myeloid cell-derived proteases produce a proinflammatory form of IL-37 that signals via IL-36 receptor engagement</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36525507/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines are key barrier cytokines that are typically expressed as inactive, or partially active, precursors that require proteolysis within their amino termini for activation. IL-37 is an enigmatic member of the IL-1 family that has been proposed to be activated by caspase-1 and to exert anti-inflammatory activity through engagement of the IL-18R and SIGIRR. However, here we show that the longest IL-37 isoform, IL-37b, exhibits robust proinflammatory activity upon amino-terminal proteolysis by neutrophil elastase or cathepsin S. In sharp contrast, caspase-1 failed to process or activate IL-37 at concentrations that robustly activated its canonical substrate, IL-1β. IL-37 and IL-36 exhibit high structural homology, and, consistent with this, a K53-truncated form of IL-37, mimicking the cathepsin S-processed form of this cytokine, was found to exert its proinflammatory effects via IL-36 receptor engagement and produced an inflammatory signature practically identical to IL-36. Administration of K53-truncated IL-37b intraperitoneally into wild-type mice also elicited an inflammatory response that was attenuated in &lt;em&gt;IL-36R&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; animals. These data demonstrate that, in common with other IL-1 family members, mature IL-37 can also elicit proinflammatory effects upon processing by specific proteases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulation of CD18 stability by SIGIRR-modulated ubiquitination: new insights into the relationship between innate immune response and acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36527283/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inappropriate accumulation of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and subsequent excessive production of immune responses play critical roles in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI), but the core negative regulators governing innate signalling in AMs are ill defined. We have previously shown that single immunoglobin IL-1 receptor-related protein (SIGIRR), a negative regulator of IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor signalling, inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in AMs. To address the biological relevance of SIGIRR in vivo, we generated a murine ALI model via intratracheal instillation of LPS. Intriguingly, SIGIRR expression was observed to be decreased in resident and recruited macrophages during ALI. This decrease was associated with parallel induction in CD18 protein levels in LPS-challenged lung tissues. Through intranasal injection of SIGIRR lentiviral particles studies, we showed that the overexpression of SIGIRR attenuated recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils, decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and ameliorated pathological changes in lungs. Whilst exploring the basis for this phenotype, SIGIRR was found to be coexpressed with CD18 in AMs, and SIGIRR potentiated the instability of CD18 protein via enhancement of its ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Conversely, by using CD18-/- mice, we further observed that CD18 deletion completely abolished the therapeutic effects of overexpression of SIGIRR on LPS-induced ALI. Mover, overexpression of CD18 in AMs promoted adhesion to ECM components, enhanced TLR4-mediated inflammasome activation and thereby potentiated IL-1β production. These data collectively identify SIGIRR/CD18 as a key negative regulatory circuit maintaining innate immune homeostasis in AMs along the pathogenesis of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NETosis is a key host immune process against a pathogenic infection during innate immune activation, consisting of a neutrophil &amp;ldquo;explosion&amp;rdquo; and, consequently, NET formation, containing mainly DNA, histones, and other nuclear proteins. During sepsis, an exacerbated immune host response to an infection occurs, activating the innate immunity and NETosis events, which requires histone H3 citrullination. Our group compared the circulating histone levels with those citrullinated H3 levels in plasma samples of septic patients. In addition, we demonstrated that citrullinated histones were less cytotoxic for endothelial cells than histones without this post-translational modification. Citrullinated histones did not affect cell viability and did not activate oxidative stress. Nevertheless, citrullinated histones induced an inflammatory response, as well as regulatory endothelial mechanisms. Furthermore, septic patients showed elevated levels of circulating citrullinated histone H3, indicating that the histone citrullination is produced during the first stages of sepsis, probably due to the NETosis process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite exosome promise as endogenous drug delivery vehicles, the current understanding of exosome may be insufficient to develop their various applications. Here we synthesized five sialic acid analogues with different length N-acyl side chains and screened out the optimal metabolic precursor for exosome labeling via bio-orthogonal click chemistry. In proof-of-principle labeling experiments, exosomes derived from macrophages (RAW-Exo) strongly co-localized with central nervous system (CNS) microglia. Inspired by this discovery, we developed a resveratrol-loaded RAW-Exo formulation (RSV&amp;amp;Exo) for multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment. Intranasal administration of RSV&amp;amp;Exo significantly inhibited inflammatory responses in the CNS and peripheral system in a mouse model of MS and effectively improved the clinical evolution of MS in vivo. These findings suggested the feasibility and efficacy of engineered RSV&amp;amp;Exo administration for MS, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with unusual changes in the human gut microbiota, most commonly coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, hypertension, and heart failure. Immune mechanisms maintain a dynamic balance between the gut microbiota and the host immune system. When one side changes and the balance is disrupted, different degrees of damage are inflicted on the host and a diseased state gradually develops over time. This review summarizes the immune mechanism of the gut microbiota and its metabolites in the occurrence of common CVDs, discusses the relationship between gut-heart axis dysfunction and the progression of CVD, and lists the currently effective methods of regulating the gut microbiota for the treatment of CVDs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alveolar macrophages instruct CD8&#43; T cell expansion by antigen cross-presentation in lung</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; memory T cells play central roles in protective immunity to respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus (IAV). Here, we find that alveolar macrophages (AMs) function as antigen-presenting cells that support the expansion of lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; memory T cells. Intranasal antigen administration to mice subcutaneously immunized with antigen results in a rapid expansion of antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the lung, which is dependent on antigen cross-presentation by AMs. AMs highly express interleukin-18 (IL-18), which mediates subsequent formation of CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; resident memory T (T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;) cells in the lung. In a mouse model of IAV infection, AMs are required for expansion of virus-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells and inhibiting virus replication in the lungs during secondary infection. These results suggest that AMs instruct a rapid expansion of antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in lung, which protect the host from respiratory virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immune checkpoint therapy-elicited sialylation of IgG antibodies impairs antitumorigenic type I interferon responses in hepatocellular carcinoma</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ICB therapy catalyzes IgG sialylation in HCC that predicts an improved outcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effector T cells trigger sialylated IgG via IFN-γ-ST6Gal-I-dependent pathways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sialylated IgG binding to DC-SIGN abrogates macrophage type I IFN production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impeding IgG sialylation enhances antitumorigenic T cell immunity during ICB therapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reinvigoration of anti-tumor T cells in response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is well established. Whether and how ICB therapy manipulates antibody-mediated immune response in cancer environments, however, remains elusive. Using tandem mass spectrometric analysis of modification of immunoglobulin G (IgG) from hepatoma tissues, we identified a role of ICB therapy in catalyzing IgG sialylation in the Fc region. Effector T cells triggered sialylation of IgG via an interferon (IFN)-γ-ST6Gal-I-dependent pathway. DC-SIGN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages represented the main target cells of sialylated IgG. Upon interacting with sialylated IgG, DC-SIGN stimulated Raf-1-elicited elevation of ATF3, which inactivated cGAS-STING pathway and eliminated subsequent type-I-IFN-triggered antitumorigenic immunity. Although enhanced IgG sialylation in tumors predicted improved therapeutic outcomes for patients receiving ICB therapy, impeding IgG sialylation augmented antitumorigenic T cell immunity after ICB therapy. Thus, targeting antibody-based negative feedback action of ICB therapy has potential for improving efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Locally organised and activated Fth1hi neutrophils aggravate inflammation of acute lung injury in an IL-10-dependent manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36513690/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common respiratory critical syndrome with no effective therapeutic intervention. Neutrophils function in the overwhelming inflammatory process of acute lung injury (ALI) caused by ARDS; however, the phenotypic heterogeneity of pulmonary neutrophils in ALI/ARDS remains largely unknown. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify two transcriptionally and functionally heterogeneous neutrophil populations (Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu and Prok2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu) with distinct locations in LPS-induced ALI mouse lungs. Exposure to LPS promotes the Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu subtype, with more inflammatory factors, stronger antioxidant, and decreased apoptosis under the regulation of interleukin-10. Furthermore, prolonged retention of Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu within lung tissue aggravates inflammatory injury throughout the development of ALI/ARDS. Notably, ARDS patients have high ratios of Fth1 to Prok2 expression in pulmonary neutrophils, suggesting that the Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu population may promote the pathological development and provide a marker of poor outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STAT3/mitophagy axis coordinates macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory bone loss</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36502520/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a cytokine-responsive transcription factor, is known to play a role in immunity and bone remodeling. However, whether and how STAT3 impacts macrophage NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation associated with inflammatory bone loss remains unknown. Here, STAT3 signaling is hyperactivated in macrophages in the context of both non-sterile and sterile inflammatory osteolysis, and this was highly correlated with the cleaved interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression pattern. Strikingly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 markedly blocks macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro, thereby relieving inflammatory macrophage-amplified osteoclast formation and bone resorptive activity. Mechanistically, STAT3 inhibition in macrophages triggers PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)-dependent mitophagy that eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria, reverses mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, and inhibits mitochondrial reactive oxygen species release, thus inactivating the NLRP3 inflammasome. In vivo, STAT3 inhibition effectively protects mice from both infection-induced periapical lesions and aseptic titanium particle-mediated calvarial bone erosion with potent induction of PINK1 and downregulation of inflammasome activation, macrophage infiltration, and osteoclast formation. This study reveals the regulatory role of the STAT3/mitophagy axis at the osteo-immune interface and highlights a potential therapeutic intervention to prevent inflammatory bone loss.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Engineering antiviral immune-like systems for autonomous virus detection and inhibition in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that viral diseases represent an enormous public health and economic threat to mankind and that individuals with compromised immune systems are at greater risk of complications and death from viral diseases. The development of broad-spectrum antivirals is an important part of pandemic preparedness. Here, we have engineer a series of designer cells which we term autonomous, intelligent, virus-inducible immune-like (ALICE) cells as sense-and-destroy antiviral system. After developing a destabilized STING-based sensor to detect viruses from seven different genera, we have used a synthetic signal transduction system to link viral detection to the expression of multiple antiviral effector molecules, including antiviral cytokines, a CRISPR-Cas9 module for viral degradation and the secretion of a neutralizing antibody. We perform a proof-of-concept study using multiple iterations of our ALICE system in vitro, followed by in vivo functionality testing in mice. We show that dual output ALICE&lt;sub&gt;SaCas9+Ab&lt;/sub&gt; system delivered by an AAV-vector inhibited viral infection in herpetic simplex keratitis (HSK) mouse model. Our work demonstrates that viral detection and antiviral countermeasures can be paired for intelligent sense-and-destroy applications as a flexible and innovative method against virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prolonged hypernutrition impairs TREM2-dependent efferocytosis to license chronic liver inflammation and NASH development</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36521495/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TREM2-dependent macrophage efferocytosis maintains immune homeostasis in the fatty liver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hepatocyte-derived S1P upregulates TREM2 in infiltrated liver macrophages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent obesity causes TREM2 shedding via TNF and IL-1β-induced proteolytic cleavage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of TREM2 disables efferocytosis to license chronic liver inflammation and NASH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity-induced chronic liver inflammation is a hallmark of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)—an aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, it remains unclear how such a low-grade, yet persistent, inflammation is sustained in the liver. Here, we show that the macrophage phagocytic receptor TREM2, induced by hepatocyte-derived sphingosine-1-phosphate, was required for efferocytosis of lipid-laden apoptotic hepatocytes and thereby maintained liver immune homeostasis. However, prolonged hypernutrition led to the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1β in the liver to induce TREM2 shedding through ADAM17-dependent proteolytic cleavage. Loss of TREM2 resulted in aberrant accumulation of dying hepatocytes, thereby further augmenting proinflammatory cytokine production. This ultimately precipitated a vicious cycle that licensed chronic inflammation to drive simple steatosis transition to NASH. Therefore, impaired macrophage efferocytosis is a previously unrecognized key pathogenic event that enables chronic liver inflammation in obesity. Blocking TREM2 cleavage to restore efferocytosis may represent an effective strategy to treat NASH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblast inflammatory priming determines regenerative versus fibrotic skin repair in reindeer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36493752/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reindeer antler velvet regenerates after wounding whereas back skin forms a scar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fibroblasts direct site-specific immune cell recruitment and differentiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fibroblast fate reversion and absence of inflammatory signals enables regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obstructing fibroblast inflammatory signals enhances skin regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult mammalian skin wounds heal by forming fibrotic scars. We report that full-thickness injuries of reindeer antler skin (velvet) regenerate, whereas back skin forms fibrotic scar. Single-cell multi-omics reveal that uninjured velvet fibroblasts resemble human fetal fibroblasts, whereas back skin fibroblasts express inflammatory mediators mimicking pro-fibrotic adult human and rodent fibroblasts. Consequently, injury elicits site-specific immune responses: back skin fibroblasts amplify myeloid infiltration and maturation during repair, whereas velvet fibroblasts adopt an immunosuppressive phenotype that restricts leukocyte recruitment and hastens immune resolution. Ectopic transplantation of velvet to scar-forming back skin is initially regenerative, but progressively transitions to a fibrotic phenotype akin to the scarless fetal-to-scar-forming transition reported in humans. Skin regeneration is diminished by intensifying, or enhanced by neutralizing, these pathologic fibroblast-immune interactions. Reindeer represent a powerful comparative model for interrogating divergent wound healing outcomes, and our results nominate decoupling of fibroblast-immune interactions as a promising approach to mitigate scar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lipid-laden lung mesenchymal cells foster breast cancer metastasis via metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells and natural killer cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lung mesenchymal cells (MCs) store neutral lipids during breast cancer progression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-1β elicits neutral lipid accumulation in lung MCs to foster metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lipid-laden MCs metabolically reprogram both tumor cells and NK cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting lipid-laden MCs improves the efficacy of NK cell-based immunotherapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the distant organ environment is known to support metastasis of primary tumors, its metabolic roles in this process remain underdetermined. Here, in breast cancer models, we found lung-resident mesenchymal cells (MCs) accumulating neutral lipids at the pre-metastatic stage. This was partially mediated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (HILPDA) that subsequently represses adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) activity in lung MCs. MC-specific ablation of the ATGL or HILPDA genes in mice reinforced and reduced lung metastasis of breast cancer respectively, suggesting a metastasis-promoting effect of lipid-laden MCs. Mechanistically, lipid-laden MCs transported their lipids to tumor cells and natural killer (NK) cells via exosome-like vesicles, leading to heightened tumor cell survival and proliferation and NK cell dysfunction. Blockage of IL-1β, which was effective singly, improved the efficacy of adoptive NK cell immunotherapy in mitigating lung metastasis. Collectively, lung MCs metabolically regulate tumor cells and anti-tumor immunity to facilitate breast cancer lung metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mitochondria-targeted sgRNA library for interrogating mitochondrial function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial regulators of type I interferon (IFN-I) response are identified&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cristae disorganization induces mtDNA release and STING-dependent IFN-I response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knockout of cristae regulator Metaxin-2 causes the IFN-I response in vivo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial damage causes mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release to activate the type I interferon (IFN-I) response via the cGAS-STING pathway. mtDNA-induced inflammation promotes autoimmune- and aging-related degenerative disorders. However, the global picture of inflammation-inducing mitochondrial damages remains obscure. Here, we have performed a mitochondria-targeted CRISPR knockout screen for regulators of the IFN-I response. Strikingly, our screen reveals dozens of hits enriched with key regulators of cristae architecture, including phospholipid cardiolipin and protein complexes such as OPA1, mitochondrial contact site and cristae organization (MICOS), sorting and assembly machinery (SAM), mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB), prohibitin (PHB), and the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;-ATP synthase. Disrupting these cristae organizers consistently induces mtDNA release and the STING-dependent IFN-I response. Furthermore, knocking out MTX2, a subunit of the SAM complex whose null mutations cause progeria in humans, induces a robust STING-dependent IFN-I response in mouse liver. Taken together, beyond revealing the central role of cristae architecture to prevent mtDNA release and inflammation, our results mechanistically link mitochondrial cristae disorganization and inflammation, two emerging hallmarks of aging and aging-related degenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mannose is a naturally occurring sugar widely consumed in the daily diet; however, mechanistic insights into how mannose metabolism affects intestinal inflammation remain lacking. Herein, we reported that mannose supplementation ameliorated colitis development and promoted colitis recovery. Macrophage-secreted inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-α, induced pathological endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), which was prevented by mannose via normalization of protein N-glycosylation. By preserving epithelial integrity, mannose reduced the inflammatory activation of colonic macrophages. On the other hand, mannose directly suppressed macrophage TNF-α production translationally by reducing the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate level, thus promoting GAPDH binding to TNF-α mRNA. Additionally, we found dysregulated mannose metabolism in the colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, we revealed that activating PMM2 activity with epalrestat, a clinically approved drug for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, elicited further sensitization to the therapeutic effect of mannose. Therefore, mannose metabolism prevents TNF-α-mediated pathogenic crosstalk between IECs and intestinal macrophages, thereby normalizing aberrant immunometabolism in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced acute lung injury is such a serious risk to public health, but the pathological regulation remains unclear. Here, we reported that PA mediated epithelial necroptosis plays an important role in pathological process. Pharmacological and genomic ablation of necroptosis signaling ameliorate PA mediated ALI and pulmonary inflammation. Our results further proved NLRP3 inflammasome to involve in the process. Mechanism investigation revealed the cross-talking between inflammasome activation and necroptosis that MLKL-dependent necroptosis signaling promotes the change of mitochondrial membrane potential for the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is the important trigger for functional inflammasome activation. Furthermore, antioxidants such as Mito-TEMPO was confirmed to significantly restrain inflammasome activation in epithelium, resulting in a reduction in PA induced pulmonary inflammation. Taken together, our findings revealed that necroptosis-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome in epithelium plays a crucial role in PA mediated injury, which could be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Highlights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSMA2, a critical component of the 20S and 26S proteasome, is involved in key cellular functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOMAscan analysis identified many lung cell proteins either up- or down-regulated by PSMA2 knockdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSMA2 knockdown affected proteins involved in immune response, cytokine signaling, cellular stress and injury, and cancer responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteasome subunit alpha type-2 (PSMA2) is a critical component of the 20S proteasome, which is the core particle of the 26S proteasome complex and is involved in cellular protein quality control by recognizing and recycling defective proteins. PSMA2 expression dysregulation has been detected in different human diseases and viral infections. No study yet has reported PSMA2 knockdown (KD) effects on the cellular proteome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used SOMAScan, an aptamer-based multiplexed technique, to measure &amp;gt;1300 human proteins to determine the impact of PSMA2 KD on A549 human lung epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; PSMA2 KD resulted in significant dysregulation of 52 cellular proteins involved in different bio-functions, including cellular movement and development, cell death and survival, and cancer. The immune system and signal transduction were the most affected cellular functions. PSMA2 KD caused dysregulation of several signaling pathways involved in immune response, cytokine signaling, organismal growth and development, cellular stress and injury (including autophagy and unfolded protein response), and cancer responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, this study helps us better understand the importance of PSMA2 in different cellular functions, signaling pathways, and human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting endogenous kidney regeneration using anti-IL11 therapy in acute and chronic models of kidney disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36470928/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kidney has large regenerative capacity, but this is compromised when kidney damage is excessive and renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) undergo SNAI1-driven growth arrest. Here we investigate the role of IL11 in TECs, kidney injury and renal repair. IL11 stimulation of TECs induces ERK- and p90RSK-mediated GSK3β inactivation, SNAI1 upregulation and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Mice with acute kidney injury upregulate IL11 in TECs leading to SNAI1 expression and kidney dysfunction, which is not seen in Il11 deleted mice or in mice administered a neutralizing IL11 antibody in either preemptive or treatment modes. In acute kidney injury, anti-TGFβ reduces renal fibrosis but exacerbates inflammation and tubule damage whereas anti-IL11 reduces all pathologies. Mice with TEC-specific deletion of Il11ra1 have reduced pathogenic signaling and are protected from renal injury-induced inflammation, fibrosis, and failure. In a model of chronic kidney disease, anti-IL11 therapy promotes TEC proliferation and parenchymal regeneration, reverses fibroinflammation and restores renal mass and function. These data highlight IL11-induced mesenchymal transition of injured TECs as an important renal pathology and suggest IL11 as a therapeutic target for restoring stalled endogenous regeneration in the diseased kidney.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of cannabinoid-2 receptor protects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced acute lung injury and inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463179/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Bacterial pneumonia is a major risk factor for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; (PA), an opportunistic pathogen with an increasing resistance acquired against multiple drugs, is one of the main causative agents of ALI and ARDS in diverse clinical settings. Given the anti-inflammatory role of the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2R), the effect of CB2R activation in the regulation of PA-induced ALI and inflammation was tested in a mouse model as an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In order to activate CB2R, a selective synthetic agonist, JWH133, was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, SR144528 (a selective CB2R antagonist) was administered in combination with JWH133 to test the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effect. PA was administered intratracheally (i.t.) for induction of pneumonia in mice. At 24 h after PA exposure, lung mechanics were measured using the FlexiVent system. The total cell number, protein content, and neutrophil population in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. The bacterial load in the whole lung was also measured. Lung injury was evaluated by histological examination and PA-induced inflammation was assessed by measuring the levels of BALF cytokines and chemokines. Neutrophil activation (examined by immunofluorescence and immunoblot) and PA-induced inflammatory signaling (analyzed by immunoblot) were also studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CB2R activation by JWH133 was found to significantly reduce PA-induced ALI and the bacterial burden. CB2R activation also suppressed the PA-induced increase in immune cell infiltration, neutrophil population, and inflammatory cytokines. These effects were abrogated by a CB2R antagonist, SR144528, further confirming the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effects. CB2R-knock out (CB2RKO) mice had a significantly higher level of PA-induced inflammation as compared to that in WT mice. CB2R activation diminished the excess activation of neutrophils, whereas mice lacking CB2R had elevated neutrophil activation. Pharmacological activation of CB2R significantly reduced the PA-induced NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, whereas CB2KO mice had elevated NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings indicate that CB2R activation ameliorates PA-induced lung injury and inflammation, thus paving the path for new therapeutic avenues against PA pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setd2 supports GATA3&#43;ST2&#43; thymic-derived Treg cells and suppresses intestinal inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463230/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treg cells acquire distinct transcriptional properties to suppress specific inflammatory responses. Transcription characteristics of Treg cells are regulated by epigenetic modifications, the mechanism of which remains obscure. Here, we report that Setd2, a histone H3K36 methyltransferase, is important for the survival and suppressive function of Treg cells, especially those from the intestine. Setd2 supports GATA3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;ST2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intestinal thymic-derived Treg (tTreg) cells by facilitating the expression and reciprocal relationship of GATA3 and ST2 in tTreg cells. IL-33 preferentially boosts Th2 cells rather than GATA3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Treg cells in Foxp3&lt;sup&gt;Cre-YFP&lt;/sup&gt;Setd2&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt; mice, corroborating the constraint of Th2 responses by Setd2 expression in Treg cells. SETD2 sustains GATA3 expression in human Treg cells, and SETD2 expression is increased in Treg cells from human colorectal cancer tissues. Epigenetically, Setd2 regulates the transcription of target genes (including &lt;em&gt;Il1rl1&lt;/em&gt;) by modulating the activity of promoters and intragenic enhancers where H3K36me3 is typically deposited. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of Treg cells and intestinal immunity by Setd2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Splenic-targeting biomimetic nanovaccine for elevating protective immunity against virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463277/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The prevalence of viral infectious diseases has become a serious threat to public safety, economic and social development. Vaccines have been served as the most effective platform to prevent virus transmission via the activation of host immune responses, while the low immunogenicity or safety, the high cost of production, storage, transport limit their effective clinical application. Therefore, there is a need to develop a promising strategy to improve the immunogenicity and safety of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We developed a splenic-targeting biomimetic nanovaccine (NV) that can boost protective humoral and cellular immunity against african swine fever virus (ASFV) infection. The universal PLGA nanoparticles (CMR-PLGA/p54 NPs) coated with mannose and CpG (TLR9 agonist) co-modified red blood cell (RBC) membrane were prepared, which comprised a viral antigen (p54) and can be served as a versatile nanovaccine for elevating protective immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CMR-PLGA/p54 NVs could be effectively uptaken by BMDC and promoted BMDC maturation in vitro. After subcutaneous immunization, antigen could be effectively delivered to the splenic dendritic cells (DCs) due to the splenic homing ability of RBC and DC targeting capacity of mannose, which promoted antigen presentation and DCs maturation, and further elicited higher levels of cytokines secretion and specific IgG titers, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells activation and B maturation. Moreover, NVs demonstrated notable safety during the immunization period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study demonstrates the high potential of CMR-PLGA NPs as vaccine delivery carriers to promote humoral and cellular immune responses, and it provides a promising strategy to develop safe and effective vaccines against viral infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut dysbiosis induces the development of mastitis through a reduction in host anti-inflammatory enzyme activity by endotoxemia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36451232/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36451232/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Mounting experimental evidence has shown that the gut microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of mastitis, and clinical investigations have found that the occurrence of mastitis is correlated with ruminal dysbiosis. However, the underlying mechanism by which the ruminal microbiota participates in the development of mastitis remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In the present study, we found that cows with clinical mastitis had marked systemic inflammation, which was associated with significant ruminal dysbiosis, especially enriched Proteobacteria in the rumen. Ruminal microbiota transplantation from mastitis cows (M-RMT) to mice induced mastitis symptoms in recipient mice along with increased mammary proinflammatory signature activation of the TLR4-cGAS-STING-NF-κB/NLRP3 pathways. M-RMT also induced mucosal inflammation and impaired intestinal barrier integrity, leading to increased endotoxemia and systemic inflammation. Moreover, we showed that M-RMT mirrored ruminal microbiota disruption in the gut of recipient mice, as evidenced by enriched Proteobacteria and similar bacterial functions, which were correlated with most proinflammatory parameters and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in mice. Recurrent low-grade LPS treatment mirrored gut dysbiosis-induced endotoxemia and caused severe mastitis in mice. Furthermore, we found that gut dysbiosis-derived LPS reduced host alkaline phosphatase activity by activating neuraminidase (Neu), which facilitates low-grade LPS exposure and E. coli-induced mastitis in mice. Conversely, treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase or the Neu inhibitor zanamivir alleviated low-grade LPS exposure and E. coli-induced mastitis in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results suggest that ruminal dysbiosis-derived low-grade endotoxemia can cause mastitis and aggravate pathogen-induced mastitis by impairing host anti-inflammatory enzymes, which implies that regulating the ruminal or gut microbiota to prevent low-grade systemic inflammation is a potential strategy for mastitis intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving head and neck cancer therapies by immunomodulation of the tumour microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36456755/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted immunotherapy has improved patient survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but less than 20% of patients produce a durable response to these treatments. Thus, new immunotherapies that consider all key players of the complex HNSCC tumour microenvironment (TME) are necessary to further enhance tumour-specific T cell responses in patients. HNSCC is an ideal tumour type in which to evaluate immune and non-immune cell differences because of two distinct TME aetiologies (human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative disease), multiple anatomic sites for tumour growth, and clear distinctions between patients with locally advanced disease and those with recurrent and/or metastatic disease. Recent technological and scientific advancements have provided a more complete picture of all cellular constituents within this complex TME and have evaluated the interplay of both immune and non-immune cells within HNSCC. Here, we include a comprehensive analysis of the complete ecosystem of the HNSCC TME, performed utilizing data-rich resources such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, and cutting-edge techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, high-dimensional flow cytometry and spatial multispectral imaging, to generate improved treatment strategies for this diverse disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HTLV-1 infection of donor-derived T cells might promote acute graft-versus-host disease following liver transplantation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36450748/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) is a rare, but severe complication of liver transplantation (LT). It is caused by the activation of donor immune cells in the graft against the host shortly after transplantation, but the contributing pathogenic factors remain unclear. Here we show that human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) infection of donor T cells is highly associated with aGVHD following LT. The presence of HTLV-1 in peripheral blood and tissue samples from a discovery cohort of 7 aGVHD patients and 17 control patients is assessed with hybridization probes (TargetSeq), mass cytometry (CyTOF), and multiplex immunohistology (IMC). All 7 of our aGVHD patients display detectable HTLV-1 Tax signals by IMC. We identify donor-derived cells based on a Y chromosome-specific genetic marker, EIF1AY. Thus, we confirm the presence of CD4+Tax+EIF1AY+ T cells and Tax+CD68+EIF1AY+ antigen-presenting cells, indicating HTLV-1 infection of donor immune cells. In an independent cohort of 400 patients, we verify that HTLV-1 prevalence correlates with aGVHD incidence, while none of the control viruses shows significant associations. Our findings thus provide new insights into the aetio-pathology of liver-transplantation-associated aGVHD and raise the possibility of preventing aGVHD prior to transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFIH1/IRF1/STAT1 promotes sepsis associated inflammatory lung injury via activating macrophage M1 polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36462334/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36462334/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIH1 is activated by infection, which triggers the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor IRF1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRF1 then attaches to the STAT1 promoter region to initiate the transcription of STAT1 and polarization of macrophage M1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRF1 has been identified as the essential molecule that controls the macrophage M1 polarization and the onset of septic ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research has shown that the phenotypic change in macrophages from M0 to M1 is essential for the start of the inflammatory process in septic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Potential treatment targets might be identified with more knowledge of the molecular regulation of M1 macrophages in septic ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-microarray interrelated analysis of high-throughput experiments from ARDS patients and macrophage polarization was conducted to identify the hub genes associated with macrophage M1 polarization and septic ARDS. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Poly (I:C) were utilized to stimulate bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) for M1-polarized macrophage model construction. Knock down of the hub genes on BMDMs via shRNAs was used to screen the genes regulating macrophage M1 polarization in vitro. The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model was constructed in knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice to explore whether the screened genes regulate macrophage M1 polarization in septic ARDS in vivo. ChIP-seq and further experiments on BMDMs were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bioinformatics analysis of gene expression profiles from a clinical cohort of 26 ARDS patients and macrophage polarization found that the 5 hub genes (IFIH1, IRF1, STAT1, IFIT3, GBP1) may have a synergistic effect on macrophage M1 polarization in septic ARDS. Further in vivo investigations indicated that IFIH1, STAT1 and IRF1 contribute to macrophage M1 polarization. The histological evaluation and immunohistochemistry of the lungs from the IRF1-/- and WT mice indicated that knockout of IRF1 markedly alleviated CLP-induced lung injury and M1-polarized infiltration. Moreover, the molecular mechanism investigations indicated that knockdown of IFIH1 markedly promoted IRF1 translocation into the nucleus. Knockout of IRF1 significantly decreases the expression of STAT1. ChIP-seq and PCR further confirmed that IRF1, as a transcription factor of STAT1, binds to the promoter region of STAT1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRF1 was identified as the key molecule that regulates macrophage M1polarization and septic ARDS development in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, as the adaptor in response to infection mimics irritants, IFIH1 promotes IRF1 (transcription factor) translocation into the nucleus to initiate STAT1 transcription.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has wrought havoc on the world economy and people&amp;rsquo;s daily lives. The inability to comprehensively control COVID-19 is due to the difficulty of early and timely diagnosis, the lack of effective therapeutic drugs, and the limited effectiveness of vaccines. The body contains billions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have shown remarkable potential in disease diagnosis, drug development, and vaccine carriers. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that EVs may participate or assist the body in defence, antagonism, recovery and acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2. On the one hand, intercepting and decrypting the general intelligence carried in circulating EVs from COVID-19 patients will provide an important hint for diagnosis and treatment; on the other hand, engineered EVs modified by gene editing in the laboratory will amplify the effectiveness of inhibiting infection, replication and destruction of ever-mutating SARS-CoV-2, facilitating tissue repair and making a better vaccine. To comprehensively understand the interaction between EVs and SARS-CoV-2, providing new insights to overcome some difficulties in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19, we conducted a rounded review in this area. We also explain numerous critical challenges that these tactics face before they enter the clinic, and this work will provide previous &amp;lsquo;meet change with constancy&amp;rsquo; lessons for responding to future similar public health disasters. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide a &amp;lsquo;meet changes with constancy&amp;rsquo; strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2 that spans defence, antagonism, recovery, and acquired immunity. Targets for COVID-19 diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of progression may be found by capture of the message decoding in circulating EVs. Engineered and biomimetic EVs can boost effects of the natural EVs, especially anti-SARS-CoV-2, targeted repair of damaged tissue, and improvement of vaccine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>B cell expansion hinders the stroma-epithelium regenerative cross talk during mucosal healing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36462502/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B cells are the dominant immune cell type during colonic mucosal healing (MH)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFN-induced B cells are associated with injury and expand during MH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B cell depletion results in enhanced MH following intestinal injury&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B cells impair the interactions between IEC and stromal cells during MH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic promotion of intestinal regeneration holds great promise, but defining the cellular mechanisms that influence tissue regeneration remains an unmet challenge. To gain insight into the process of mucosal healing, we longitudinally examined the immune cell composition during intestinal damage and regeneration. B cells were the dominant cell type in the healing colon, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed expansion of an IFN-induced B cell subset during experimental mucosal healing that predominantly located in damaged areas and associated with colitis severity. B cell depletion accelerated recovery upon injury, decreased epithelial ulceration, and enhanced gene expression programs associated with tissue remodeling. scRNA-seq from the epithelial and stromal compartments combined with spatial transcriptomics and multiplex immunostaining showed that B cells decreased interactions between stromal and epithelial cells during mucosal healing. Activated B cells disrupted the epithelial-stromal cross talk required for organoid survival. Thus, B cell expansion during injury impairs epithelial-stromal cell interactions required for mucosal healing, with implications for the treatment of IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhaled platelet vesicle-decoyed biomimetic nanoparticles attenuate inflammatory lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36523494/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory response which causes serious damages to alveolar epithelia and vasculature, and it still remains high lethality and mortality with no effective treatment. Based on the inflammatory homing of platelets and cell membrane cloaking nanotechnology, in this study we developed a biomimetic anti-inflammation nanoparticle delivery system for ALI treatment. PM@Cur-RV NPs were designed by combining the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (NPs) coated with platelet membrane vesicles (PM) for the purpose of highly targeting delivery of curcumin (Cur) and resveratrol (RV) to inflammatory lungs. PM@Cur-RV NPs showed good biocompatibility and biosafety both in vitro and in vivo. Accumulation of NPs into lung tract was observed after inhaled NPs. Remarkably, the inhalation of PM@Cur-RV NPs effectively inhibited lung vascular injury evidenced by the decreased lung vascular permeability, and the reduced proinflammatory cytokine burden in an ALI mouse model. The analysis of infiltrated macrophages in the lungs showed that the Cur-RV-modulated macrophage polarized towards M2 phenotype and the decreased histone lactylation might contribute to their anti-inflammation effects. Together, this work highlights the potential of inhalation of biomimetic nanoparticle delivery of curcumin and resveratrol for the treatment of pulmonary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reprogramming of T cell-derived small extracellular vesicles using IL2 surface engineering induces potent anti-cancer effects through miRNA delivery</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36447429/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) exhibit anti-cancer effects. However, their anti-cancer potential should be reinforced to enhance clinical applicability. Herein, we generated interleukin-2-tethered sEVs (IL2-sEVs) from engineered Jurkat T cells expressing IL2 at the plasma membrane via a flexible linker to induce an autocrine effect. IL2-sEVs increased the anti-cancer ability of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells without affecting regulatory T (T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; ) cells and down-regulated cellular and exosomal PD-L1 expression in melanoma cells, causing their increased sensitivity to CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Its effect on CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T and melanoma cells was mediated by several IL2-sEV-resident microRNAs (miRNAs), whose expressions were upregulated by the autocrine effects of IL2. Among the miRNAs, miR-181a-3p and miR-223-3p notably reduced the PD-L1 protein levels in melanoma cells. Interestingly, miR-181a-3p increased the activity of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells while suppressing Treg cell activity. IL2-sEVs inhibited tumour progression in melanoma-bearing immunocompetent mice, but not in immunodeficient mice. The combination of IL2-sEVs and existing anti-cancer drugs significantly improved anti-cancer efficacy by decreasing PD-L1 expression in vivo. Thus, IL2-sEVs are potential cancer immunotherapeutic agents that regulate both immune and cancer cells by reprogramming miRNA levels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cryo-EM structures of the active NLRP3 inflammasome disk</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36442502/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammasomes are cytosolic innate immune complexes that activate caspase-1 upon detection of pathogenic and endogenous dangers, and NLRP3 is an inflammasome sensor of membrane damage highly important in inducing inflammation. Here we report cryo-EM structures of disk-shaped active NLRP3 oligomers in complex with ATP𝛾S, the centrosomal kinase NEK7, and the adaptor protein ASC which recruits caspase-1. In these NLRP3-NEK7-ASC complexes, the central NACHT domain of NLRP3 assumes an ATP-bound conformation in which two of its subdomains rotate by ~85° relative to the ADP-bound inactive conformation. The FISNA domain conserved in NLRP3 but absent in most NLRPs becomes ordered in its key regions to stabilize the active NACHT conformation and mediate most interactions in the disk. Mutations on these interactions compromise NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 activation. The N-terminal PYDs from all the NLRP3 subunits gather together to form a PYD filament that recruits ASC PYD to elicit downstream signalling. Surprisingly, the C-terminal LRR domain and the LRR-bound NEK7 do not participate in disk interfaces. Together with previous structures of inactive NLRP3 cage in which LRR-LRR interactions play an important role, we propose that the role of NEK7 is to break the inactive cage to transform NLRP3 into the active NLRP3 inflammasome disk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distinct changes in endosomal composition promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36443515/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammasome complexes are pivotal in the innate immune response. The NLR family pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is activated in response to a broad variety of cellular stressors. However, a primary and converging sensing mechanism by the NLRP3 receptor initiating inflammasome assembly remains ill defined. Here, we demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome activators primarily converge on disruption of endoplasmic reticulum-endosome membrane contact sites (EECS). This defect causes endosomal accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and a consequent impairment of endosome-to-trans-Golgi network trafficking (ETT), necessary steps for endosomal recruitment of NLRP3 and subsequent inflammasome activation. Lowering endosomal PI4P levels prevents endosomal association of NLRP3 and inhibits inflammasome activation. Disruption of EECS or ETT is sufficient to enhance endosomal PI4P levels, to recruit NLRP3 to endosomes and to potentiate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mice with defects in ETT in the myeloid compartment are more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis. Our study thus identifies a distinct cellular mechanism leading to endosomal NLRP3 recruitment and inflammasome activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Small extracellular vesicles from Ptpn1-deficient macrophages alleviate intestinal inflammation by reprogramming macrophage polarization via lactadherin enrichment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36462232/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (Ptpn1) is known to be involved in macrophage polarization. However, whether and how Ptpn1 regulates macrophage phenotype to affect intestinal epithelial barrier function remains largely unexplored. Herein, we investigated the impact of Ptpn1 and macrophage-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) on macrophage-intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) interactions in the context of intestinal inflammation. We found that &lt;em&gt;Ptpn1&lt;/em&gt; knockdown shifts macrophages toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, thereby promoting intestinal barrier integrity and suppressing inflammatory response in the macrophage-IEC co-culture model. We further revealed that conditioned medium or sEVs isolated from Ptp1b knockdown macrophages are the primary factor driving the beneficial outcomes. Consistently, administration of the sEVs from Ptpn1-knockdown macrophages reduced disease severity and ameliorated intestinal inflammation in LPS-challenged mice. Furthermore, depletion of macrophages in mice abrogated the protective effect of &lt;em&gt;Ptpn1&lt;/em&gt;-knockdown macrophage sEVs against Salmonella Typhimurium infection. Importantly, we found lactadherin to be highly enriched in the sEVs of &lt;em&gt;Ptpn1&lt;/em&gt;-knockdown macrophages. Administration of recombinant lactadherin alleviated intestinal inflammation and barrier dysfunction by inducing macrophage M2 polarization. Interestingly, sEVs lactadherin was also internalized by macrophages and IECs, leading to macrophage M2 polarization and enhanced intestinal barrier integrity. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory and barrier-enhancing effect of lactadherin was achieved by reducing TNF-α and NF-κB activation. Thus, we demonstrated that sEVs from &lt;em&gt;Ptpn1&lt;/em&gt;-knockdown macrophages mediate the communication between IECs and macrophages through enrichment of lactadherin. The outcome could potentially lead to the development of novel therapies for intestinal inflammatory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attenuation of the Severity of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by Pomiferin through Blocking Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in an AKT/Foxo1 Pathway-Dependent Manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36471865/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) gives rise to uncontrolled inflammatory response and oxidative stress, causing very high mortality globally. Pomiferin is a kind of prenylated isoflavonoid extracted from &lt;em&gt;Maclura pomifera&lt;/em&gt;, owning anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the functions and possible mechanisms of pomiferin in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ARDS remain unknown. C57BL/6 mice were injected with LPS (5 mg/kg) intratracheally to induce an in vivo ARDS model while RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) to induce an in vitro model. Our data demonstrated that pomiferin (20 mg/kg) significantly improved pulmonary function and lung pathological injury in mice with ARDS, apart from increasing survival rate. Meanwhile, pomiferin treatment also inhibited LPS-induced inflammation as well as oxidative stress in lung tissues. LPS stimulation significantly activated AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway in lung tissues, which could be reversed after pomiferin treatment. In vitro experiments further showed that 10, 20, and 50 μM of pomiferin could enhance cell viability of RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with LPS. What is more, 3-deoxysappanchalcone (3-DE), one AKT agonist, was used to active AKT in RAW264.7 macrophages. The results further showed that 3-DE could abolish pomiferin-elicited protection in LPS-treated RAW264.7 macrophages, evidenced by activated inflammation and oxidative stress. Taken together, our study showed that pomiferin could exert an ARDS-protective effect by blocking the AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway to inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative injury, which may serve as a potential candidate for the treatment of ARDS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G-protein-signaling modulator 1 (GPSM1) exhibits strong genetic association with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Body Mass Index in population studies. However, how GPSM1 carries out such control and in which types of cells are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that myeloid GPSM1 promotes metabolic inflammation to accelerate T2D and obesity development. Mice with myeloid-specific GPSM1 ablation are protected against high fat diet-induced insulin resistance, glucose dysregulation, and liver steatosis via repression of adipose tissue pro-inflammatory states. Mechanistically, GPSM1 deficiency mainly promotes TNFAIP3 transcription via the Gαi3/cAMP/PKA/CREB axis, thus inhibiting TLR4-induced NF-κB signaling in macrophages. In addition, we identify a small-molecule compound, AN-465/42243987, which suppresses the pro-inflammatory phenotype by inhibiting GPSM1 function, which could make it a candidate for metabolic therapy. Furthermore, GPSM1 expression is upregulated in visceral fat of individuals with obesity and is correlated with clinical metabolic traits. Overall, our findings identify macrophage GPSM1 as a link between metabolic inflammation and systemic homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heme oxygenase-1 ameliorates endotoxin-induced acute lung injury by modulating macrophage polarization via inhibiting TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) remains a global public health issue without specific and effective treatment options available in the clinic. Alveolar macrophage polarization is involved in the initiation, development and progression of ALI; however, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) acts as an antioxidant in pulmonary inflammation and has been demonstrated to be linked with the severity and prognosis of ALI. In this study, the therapeutic effects of HO-1 were examined, along with the mechanisms involved, mainly focusing on alveolar macrophage polarization. HO-1 depletion induced higher iNOS and CD86 (M1 phenotype) expression but was significantly decreased in Arg-1 and CD206 (M2 phenotype) expression in BALF alveolar macrophages after equivalent LPS stimulation. We also found that HO-1 deletion distinctly accelerated the expression of inflammasome-associated components NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 in vivo and in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, on the basis of LPS for MH-S cells, levels of TXNIP, NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 were increased and HO-1 depletion exacerbated these changes, whereas double depletion of HO-1 and TXNIP partially mitigated these elevations. Also, HO-1 knockdown induced more M1 phenotype and less M2 phenotype compared with LPS alone, whereas double silence of HO-1 and TXNIP partially changed the polarization state. Taken together, we demonstrated that HO-1 could modulate macrophage polarization via TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway, which could be a potential therapeutic target for ALI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective effect and mechanism of baicalin on lung inflammatory injury in BALB/cJ mice induced by PM2.5</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36442400/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respiratory function impairment caused by PM2.5 exposure could be improved by baicalin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baicalin regulates the composition and diversity of pharyngeal microbiota in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baicalin alleviates the respiratory inflammatory response caused by PM2.5 exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baicalin exerts anti-inflammatory effects by the HMGB1/NLRP3/Casepase1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public health harms caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have become a global focus, with PM2.5 exposure recognized as a critical risk factor for global morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation is the common pathophysiological feature of respiratory diseases induced by PM2.5 and is the most critical cause of all these diseases. However, presently there is a lack of effective preventive and therapeutic approaches for inflammatory lung injuries caused by PM2.5 exposure. Baicalin is a herb-derived effective flavonoid compound with multiple health benefits. This study established a murine lung inflammatory injury model via inhalation of PM2.5 aerosols. The data showed that after baicalin intervention, lung injury pathological score of baicalin (4.16 ± 0.54, 3.33 ± 0.76, 4.00 ± 0.45) and claricid (3.00 ± 0.78) treatments were markedly lower than PM2.5-treated mice (6.17 ± 0.31), and pathological damage was alleviated. Compared to the PM2.5 group, the spleen and lung indexes in the baicalin and claricid groups were significantly reduced. The inflammatory cytokines of TNF-α, IL-18, and IL-1β in serum, alveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissue were significantly decreased in the baicalin and claricid groups. The expressions of inflammatory pathway-related genes and proteins HMGB1, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 were up-regulated in the PM2.5 group. The expressions of these genes and proteins were significantly decreased following baicalin treatment. The lung function indicators showed that the MV (65.94 ± 8.19 mL), sRaw (1.79 ± 0.08 cm H2O.s), and FRC (0.52 ± 0.01 mL) in the PM2.5 group were higher than in the control and baicalin groups, and respiratory function was improved by baicalin. PM2.5 exposure markedly altered the bacterial composition at the genus level. The dominant flora relative abundances of uncultured_bacterium_f_Muribaculaceae, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus, were decreased from the control group (9.20%, 8.53%, 6.21%) to PM2.5 group (6.26%, 5.49%, 4.77%), respectively. Following baicalin intervention, the relative abundances were 9.72%, 6.65%, and 3.57%, respectively. Therefore, baicalin could potentially prevent and improve mice lung inflammatory injury induced by PM2.5 exposure. Baicalin might provide a protective role by balancing oropharyngeal microbiota and affecting the expression of the HMGB1/Caspase1 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cellular functions of cGAS-STING signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36437149/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) senses misplaced genomic, mitochondrial, and microbial double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to synthesize 2&#39;3&amp;rsquo;-cGAMP that mobilizes stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to unleash innate immune responses, constituting a ubiquitous and effective surveillance system against tissue damage and pathogen invasion. However, imbalanced cGAS-STING signaling tethers considerably in infectious, autoimmune, malignant, fibrotic, and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, multifaceted roles for cGAS-STING signaling at the cellular scale have emerged; these include autophagy, translation, metabolism homeostasis, cellular condensation, DNA damage repair, senescence, and cell death. These dominances adaptively shape cellular physiologies and impact disease pathogenesis. However, understanding how DNA sensing-initiated responses trigger these diverse cellular processes remains an outstanding challenge. In this review we discuss recent developments of cellular physiological states controlled by cGAS-STING machinery, as well as their disease relevance and underlying mechanisms, canonical or noncanonical. Ultimately, exploiting these cellular functions and mechanisms may represent promising targets for disease therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal dysbiosis mediates cognitive impairment via the intestine and brain NLRP3 inflammasome activation in chronic sleep deprivation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36427810/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence suggests the involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in cognitive impairment induced by sleep deprivation (SD), however how the microbiota-gut-brain axis work remains elusive. Here, we discovered that chronic SD induced intestinal dysbiosis, activated NLRP3 inflammasome in the colon and brain, destructed intestinal/blood-brain barrier, and impaired cognitive function in mice. Transplantation of &amp;ldquo;SD microbiota&amp;rdquo; could almost mimic the pathological and behavioral changes caused by chronic SD. Furthermore, all the behavioral and pathological abnormalities were practically reversed in chronic sleep-deprived NLRP3-/- mice. Regional knockdown NLRP3 expression in the gut and hippocampus, respectively. We observed that down-regulation of NLRP3 in the hippocampus inhibited neuroinflammation, and ameliorated synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment induced by chronic SD. More intriguingly, the down-regulation of NLRP3 in the gut protected the intestinal barrier, attenuated the levels of peripheral inflammatory factors, down-regulated the expression of NLRP3 in the brain, and improved cognitive function in chronic SD mice. Our results identified gut microbiota as a driver in chronic SD and highlighted the NLRP3 inflammasome as a key regulator within the microbiota-gut-brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SENP1 prevents steatohepatitis by suppressing RIPK1-driven apoptosis and inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36414671/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activation of RIPK1-driven cell death and inflammation play important roles in the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the mechanism underlying RIPK1 activation in NASH remains unclear. Here we identified SENP1, a SUMO-specific protease, as a key endogenous inhibitor of RIPK1. SENP1 is progressively reduced in proportion to NASH severity in patients. Hepatocyte-specific SENP1-knockout mice develop spontaneous NASH-related phenotypes in a RIPK1 kinase-dependent manner. We demonstrate that SENP1 deficiency sensitizes cells to RIPK1 kinase-dependent apoptosis by promoting RIPK1 activation following TNFα stimulation. Mechanistically, SENP1 deSUMOylates RIPK1 in TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC), keeping RIPK1 in check. Loss of SENP1 leads to SUMOylation of RIPK1, which re-orchestrates TNF-RSC and modulates the ubiquitination patterns and activity of RIPK1. Notably, genetic inhibition of RIPK1 effectively reverses disease progression in hepatocyte-specific SENP1-knockout male mice with high-fat-diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver. We propose that deSUMOylation of RIPK1 by SENP1 provides a pathophysiologically relevant cell death-restricting checkpoint that modulates RIPK1 activation in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;SCPA is a dedicated tool for pathway analysis in scRNA-seq data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCPA assesses the multivariate distributions of pathways to detect significance&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathway analysis is a key analytical stage in the interpretation of omics data, providing a powerful method for detecting alterations in cellular processes. We recently developed a sensitive and distribution-free statistical framework for multisample distribution testing, which we implement here in the open-source R package single-cell pathway analysis (SCPA). We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCPA over commonly used methods, generate a scRNA-seq T cell dataset, and characterize pathway activity over early cellular activation. This reveals regulatory pathways in T cells, including an intrinsic type I interferon system regulating T cell survival and a reliance on arachidonic acid metabolism throughout T cell activation. A systems-level characterization of pathway activity in T cells across multiple tissues also identifies alpha-defensin expression as a hallmark of bone-marrow-derived T cells. Overall, this work provides a widely applicable tool for single-cell pathway analysis and highlights regulatory mechanisms of T cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1,2,3,4,6-O-Pentagalloylglucose Protects against Acute Lung Injury by Activating the AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 Pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious lung disease with a high mortality rate, warranting the development of novel therapies. Previously, we reported that 1,2,3,4,6-O-pentagalloylglucose (PGG) could afford protection against ALI, however, the PGG-mediated protective effects remain elusive. Herein, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) markedly inhibited the lung wet/drug weight ratio and attenuated histological changes in the lungs (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). A pretreatment with PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) reduced the number of total leukocytes and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) also attenuated oxidative stress by reducing the formation of formation and the depletion of superoxide dismutase to treat an ALI (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). To further explore the PGG-induced mechanism against an ALI, we screened the PGG pathway using immunohistochemical analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and Western blotting (WB). WB revealed that the expression levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (p-AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B phosphorylation (P-Akt), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) were significantly higher in the PGG group (60 and 30 mg/kg) than in the lipopolysaccharide group (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05); these findings were confirmed by the immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence results. Accordingly, PGG could be effective against an ALI by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress via AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling, allowing for the potential development of this as a natural drug against an ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mutant RIG-I enhances cancer-related inflammation through activation of circRIG-I signaling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIG-I/DDX58 plays a key role in host innate immunity. However, its therapeutic potential for inflammation-related cancers remains to be explored. Here we identify frameshift germline mutations of RIG-I occurring in patients with colon cancer. Accordingly, Rig-ifs/fs mice bearing a frameshift mutant Rig-i exhibit increased susceptibility to colitis-related colon cancer as well as enhanced inflammatory response to chemical, virus or bacteria. In addition to interruption of Rig-i mRNA translation, the Rig-i mutation changes the secondary structure of Rig-i pre-mRNA and impairs its association with DHX9, consequently inducing a circular RNA generation from Rig-i transcript, thereby, designated as circRIG-I. CircRIG-I is frequently upregulated in colon cancers and its upregulation predicts poor outcome of colon cancer. Mechanistically, circRIG-I interacts with DDX3X, which in turn stimulates MAVS/TRAF5/TBK1 signaling cascade, eventually activating IRF3-mediated type I IFN transcription and aggravating inflammatory damage. Reciprocally, all-trans retinoic acid acts as a DHX9 agonist, ameliorates immunopathology through suppression of circRIG-I biogenesis. Collectively, our results provide insight into mutant RIG-I action and propose a potential strategy for the treatment of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interference with LTβR signaling by tick saliva facilitates transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36383602/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyme spirochetes have coevolved with ticks to optimize transmission to hosts using tick salivary molecules (TSMs) to counteract host defenses. TSMs modulate various molecular events at the tick-host interface. Lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTβR) is a vital immune receptor and plays protective roles in host immunity against microbial infections. We found that &lt;em&gt;Ltbr&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice were more susceptible to Lyme disease spirochetes, suggesting the involvement of LTβR signaling in tick-borne &lt;em&gt;Borrelia&lt;/em&gt; infection. Further investigation showed that a 15-kDa TSM protein from &lt;em&gt;Ixodes persulcatus&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;I. persulcatus salivary&lt;/em&gt; protein; IpSAP) functioned as an immunosuppressant to facilitate the transmission and infection of Lyme disease spirochetes. IpSAP directly interacts with LTβR to block its activation, thus inhibiting the downstream signaling and consequently suppressing immunity. IpSAP immunization provided mice with significant protection against &lt;em&gt;I. persulcatus&lt;/em&gt;-mediated &lt;em&gt;Borrelia garinii&lt;/em&gt; infection. Notably, the immunization showed considerable cross-protection against other &lt;em&gt;Borrelia&lt;/em&gt; infections mediated by other ixodid ticks. One of the IpSAP homologs from other ixodid ticks showed similar effects on Lyme spirochete transmission. Together, our findings suggest that LTβR signaling plays an important role in blocking the transmission and pathogenesis of tick-borne Lyme disease spirochetes, and that IpSAP and its homologs are promising candidates for broad-spectrum vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lactoferrin Ameliorates Ovalbumin-Induced Asthma in Mice through Reducing Dendritic-Cell-Derived Th2 Cell Responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36430662/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease with symptoms such as expiratory airflow narrowing and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Millions of people suffer from asthma and are at risk of life-threatening conditions. Lactoferrin (LF) is a glycoprotein with multiple physiological functions, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antitumoral activities. LF has been shown to function in immunoregulatory activities in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) in mice. Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of LF in AHR and the functions of dendritic cells (DCs) and Th2-related responses in asthma. Twenty 8-week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into normal control (NC), ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized, and OVA-sensitized with low dose of LF (100 mg/kg) or high dose of LF (300 mg/kg) treatment groups. The mice were challenged by intranasal instillation with 5% OVA on the 21st to 27th day after the start of the sensitization period. The AHR, cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and pulmonary histology of each mouse were measured. Serum OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 and OVA-specific splenocyte responses were further detected. The results showed that LF exhibited protective effects in ameliorating AHR, as well as lung inflammation and damage, in reducing the expression of Th2 cytokines and the secretion of allergen-specific antibodies, in influencing the functions of DCs, and in decreasing the level of Th2 immune responses in a BALB/c mouse model of OVA-induced allergic asthma. Importantly, we demonstrated that LF has practical application in reducing DC-induced Th2 cell responses in asthma. In conclusion, LF exhibits anti-inflammation and immunoregulation activities in OVA-induced allergic asthma. These results suggest that LF may act as a supplement to prevent asthma-induced lung injury and provide an additional agent for reducing asthma severity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AMPK directly phosphorylates TBK1 to integrate glucose sensing into innate immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36384137/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viral infection induces acute blood glucose decline in rodents that activates AMPK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMPK directly phosphorylates TBK1 at S511 to prime antiviral sensing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMPK-TBK1 couples glucose deficiency sensing and innate immune surveillance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting the AMPK-TBK1 axis compromises innate antiviral immunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutrient sensing and damage sensing are two fundamental processes in living organisms. While hyperglycemia is frequently linked to diabetes-related vulnerability to microbial infection, how body glucose levels affect innate immune responses to microbial invasion is not fully understood. Here, we surprisingly found that viral infection led to a rapid and dramatic decrease in blood glucose levels in rodents, leading to robust AMPK activation. AMPK, once activated, directly phosphorylates TBK1 at S511, which triggers IRF3 recruitment and the assembly of MAVS or STING signalosomes. Consistently, ablation or inhibition of AMPK, knockin of TBK1-S511A, or increased glucose levels compromised nucleic acid sensing, while boosting AMPK-TBK1 cascade by AICAR or TBK1-S511E knockin improves antiviral immunity substantially in various animal models. Thus, we identify TBK1 as an AMPK substrate, reveal the molecular mechanism coupling a dual sensing of glucose and nuclei acids, and report its physiological necessity in antiviral defense.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a central cytokine in inflammatory reactions, and biologics that neutralize TNF are among the most successful drugs for the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies. In recent years, it became clear that TNF drives inflammatory responses not only directly by inducing inflammatory gene expression but also indirectly by inducing cell death, instigating inflammatory immune reactions and disease development. Hence, inhibitors of cell death are being considered as a new therapy for TNF-dependent inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of Neutrophil and Eosinophil Extracellular Trap Formation on Refractoriness in Chronic Rhinosinusitis With Nasal Polyps</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36693361/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36693361/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study investigated the clinical implications of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation (NETosis) and eosinophil extracellular trap (EET) formation (EETosis) regarding refractoriness in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Nasal polyp specimens were obtained from 117 patients with CRSwNP who received endoscopic sinus surgery. Disease control status at postoperative 1 year was assessed. Refractory cases were defined as partly controlled or uncontrolled cases according to the EPOS 2020 guidelines. NETosis and EETosis were evaluated through immunofluorescence staining (citrullinated histone H3-human neutrophil elastase and citrullinated histone-galectin-10, respectively) followed by manual counting. The z-score of NET and EET counts was used to define the following four groups: low extracellular trap formation (ETosis), NETosis-predominant, EETosis-predominant, and high-ETosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The refractory and non-refractory groups showed significant differences in the tissue eosinophil count (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005) and EET count (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.029). The tissue neutrophil count and the NET/neutrophil ratio were significantly different between the refractory and non-refractory groups of patients with neutrophilic CRS (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.045, 0.031, respectively). Refractoriness significantly differed among the low-ETosis (30.77%), NETosis-predominant (47.83%), EETosis-predominant (56.67%), and high-ETosis (83.33%) groups (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The results of this study suggest that tissue Eosinophilia and EETosis may play a prognostic role, primarily in CRSwNP and thattissue neutrophilia and NETosis can play as prognostic biomarkers in neutrophilic CRSwNP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astaxanthin ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via inhibition of inflammatory reactions and modulation of the SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36278420/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a systemic inflammatory process. A large number of studies have shown that astaxanthin (ASTA) has strong anti-inflammatory effects and almost non-toxic side effects. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of ASTA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice and its underlying mechanism. The result showed that compared with the LPS group, the expression levels of the respiratory resistance (Re), inspiratory resistance (Ri), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio, albumin (BA/SA) ratio and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the ASTA pretreatment group were significantly reduced, and total cell, neutrophil and macrophage counts were significantly decreased. HE staining results showed that alveolar interstitial edema, bleeding and erythrocyte exudation were reduced. Compared with the LPS group, the percentage of Th17 cells and the content of interleukin (IL)-17 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the ASTA pretreatment group were significantly decreased, while the content of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and the percentage of Treg cells were significantly increased. Western blot analysis showed that ASTA could up-regulate the expression level of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) and down-regulate the expression levels of phosphorylated Janus kinase 2 (p-JAK2), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) in lung tissue. The results showed that ASTA had a protective effect on LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, and its protective mechanism was through activating the SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting Treg cell differentiation and reducing inflammatory reactions and Th17 cell differentiation, which provided a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance: Xuebijing injection is a Chinese herbal-derived drug composed of radix paeoniaerubra, rhizomachuanxiong, Salvia miltiorrhiza, floscarthami, and Angelica sinensis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Xuebijing administration on pulmonary endothelial injury and coagulation dysfunction in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis rat model. Materials and methods: A CLP-induced sepsis rat model was established. The CLP rats were treated with a vehicle or Xuebijing via intravenous infusion and sacrificed at 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 h after CLP for lung tissue and blood sample collection. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was monitored. Transmission microscopy examination and H&amp;amp;E staining were performed to observe pulmonary structural alterations. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the plasma levels of epithelial markers, proinflammatory cytokines, and coagulation-related proteins. Results: Compared with vehicle treatment, Xuebijing administration maintained the MAP in the normal range until 11 h after CLP. Transmission microscopy and H&amp;amp;E staining revealed that Xuebijing administration alleviated alveolar–capillary barrier impairments and lung inflammation in CLP rats. ELISA showed that Xuebijing administration effectively reversed CLP-induced elevations in the plasma levels of epithelial markers endothelin-1 and von Willebrand factor, starting 6 and 8 h after CLP, respectively. Xuebijing administration also significantly abolished CLP-induced rises in circulating proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) at 6 h after CLP, IL-1β at 2 and 12 h after CLP, and TNF-α at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after CLP. In addition, Xuebijing administration strongly reversed CLP-induced alterations in circulating active protein C and tissue-type plasminogen activator, starting 4 h and 2 h after CLP, respectively. Conclusions: Xuebijing ameliorates pulmonary endothelial injury, systemic inflammation, and coagulation dysfunction in early sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The NLRP3 inflammasome: regulation by metabolic signalss</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36371361/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glycolytic enzymes differentially regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Itaconate post-translationally modifies kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), NLRP3, and gasdermin D (GSDMD) proteins to dampen both the NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Succination of GSDMD and GSDME blocks pyroptosis and apoptosis, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation regulate the priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several metabolic pathways are instrumental in modulating myeloid cell responses to inflammation and new findings are revealing further molecular details regarding inflammasome regulation. By targeting various proteins, itaconate – a metabolite derived from the TCA cycle – is gaining significant attention because it can dampen the NLRP3 inflammasome and lower pyroptotic cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophages undergo profound metabolic reprogramming upon sensing infectious and sterile stimuli. This metabolic shift supports and regulates essential innate immune functions, including activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Within distinct metabolic networks, key enzymes play pivotal roles to control flux restraining detrimental inflammasome signaling. However, depending on the metabolic cues, specific enzymes and metabolites result in inflammasome activation outcomes which contrast other metabolic steps in the pathway. We posit that understanding which metabolic steps commit to discrete inflammasome fates will broaden our understanding of metabolic checkpoints to maintain homeostasis and offer better therapeutic options in human disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Xuanfei Baidu formula alleviates impaired mitochondrial dynamics and activated NLRP3 inflammasome by repressing NF-κB and MAPK pathways in LPS-induced ALI and inflammation models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36423572/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36423572/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xuanfei Baidu Formula (XBF) is an effective traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) remedy for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. This herbal medicine has shown effects in reducing clinical symptoms and shortening the average length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that XBF alleviates acute lung injury (ALI) by regulating macrophage-mediated immune inflammation, but the mechanisms of action remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to evaluate the lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of XBF and its underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, XBF&amp;rsquo;s effects were investigated in an ALI mouse model induced by inhalation of atomized lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Besides, the LPS-induced inflammation model in RAW264.7 cells was used to clarify the underlying mechanisms of XBF against ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results showed that XBF treatment alleviated LPS-induced lung injury, as evidenced by reduced histopathological changes, pulmonary alveoli permeability, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the lung tissues. In addition, inflammation was alleviated as shown by decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and reduced white blood cell (WBC) count in BALF. Furthermore, consistent with the in vivo assay, XBF inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines release and pro-inflammatory polarization in RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, XBF increased mitochondrial fusion by upregulating Mfn1 and attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by repressing Casp11, respectively, to inhibit NF-κB and MAPK pathways, thus repressing pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we demonstrate that XBF exerts anti-ALI and -inflammatory effects by recovering mitochondrial dynamics and reducing inflammasome activation, providing a biological illustration of the clinical efficacy of XBF in treating COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beneficial effects of CCL8 inhibition at lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36404927/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CCL8 (MCP-2) is a chemoattractive cytokine associated with various immune-related pathologies. Recent studies show that CCL8 is significantly stimulated during acute respiratory distress syndrome in severely ill patients with COVID-19, making the inhibition of CCL8 activity a promising treatment. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury was evaluated in mice using a neutralizing antibody (1G3E5) against human CCL8. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that following IP administration, 1G3E5 was sustained at higher levels and for a longer period compared to IV administration. CCL8 expression in the lungs was not enhanced by LPS, but CCR2 and CCR5 receptors were significantly stimulated. 1G3E5-mediated inhibition of CCL8 was associated with the reduction of pulmonary inflammation and suppression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results point to a previously unrecognized, permissive role for CCL8 in mediating cytokine induction and ultimately sustaining inflammation. Disruption of CCL8 activity may provide a strategy for mitigating pulmonary inflammation during lung injury when related to abnormal cytokine induction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and Rab GTPases coordinate EGFR trafficking to regulate macrophage activation in sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36344490/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EGFR phosphorylation is required for TLR4-mediated macrophage activation during sepsis. However, whether and how intracellular EGFR is transported during endotoxemia have largely been unknown. Here, we show that LPS promotes high levels cell surface expression of EGFR in macrophages through two different transport mechanisms. On one hand, Rab10 is required for EEA1-mediated the membrane translocation of EGFR from the Golgi. On the other hand, EGFR phosphorylation prevents its endocytosis in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced membrane EGFR expression in LPS-activated macrophage. Mechanistically, upon LPS induced TLR4/EGFR phosphorylation, MAPK14 phosphorylated Rab7a at S72 impaired membrane receptor late endocytosis, which maintains EGFR membrane localization though blocking its lysosomal degradation. Meanwhile, Rab5a is also involved in the early endocytosis of EGFR. Subsequently, inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation switches M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype and alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury. Mechanistic study demonstrated that Erlotinib suppressed glycolysis-dependent M1 polarization via PKM2/HIF-1ɑ pathway and promoted M2 polarization through up-regulating PPARγ induced glutamine metabolism. Collectively, our data elucidated a more in-depth mechanism of macrophages activation, and provided stronger evidence supporting EGFR as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SLC7A8 is a key amino acids supplier for the metabolic programs that sustain homeostasis and activation of type 2 innate lymphoid cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolic adaptations enable immune responses. While much is known about how metabolism underlies T cell function, a metabolic framework for innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) is just developing. Group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), the innate counterparts of Th2, require arginine and branched-chain amino acids for proliferation and activation. How these amino acids reach the intracellular ILC2 compartment is unknown. Here, we show that SLC7A8 is the key amino acid transporter in ILC2s. &lt;em&gt;Slc7a8&lt;/em&gt; deletion in lymphocytes reduced ILC2s and attenuated responses to helminth infection and house dust mite allergens. &lt;em&gt;Slc7a8&lt;/em&gt; deficiency compromised mitochondrial OXPHOS and mammalian target of rapamycin and c-Myc pathways in ILC2s. Thus, SLC7A8 is a promising target for therapies aiming at attenuating immune inflammation in allergies and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are innate counterparts of T helper 2 (Th2) cells that maintain tissue homeostasis and respond to injuries through rapid interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13 secretion. ILC2s depend on availability of arginine and branched-chain amino acids for sustaining cellular fitness, proliferation, and cytokine secretion in both steady state and upon activation. However, the contribution of amino acid transporters to ILC2 functions is not known. Here, we found that ILC2s selectively express &lt;em&gt;Slc7a8&lt;/em&gt;, encoding a transporter for arginine and large amino acids. &lt;em&gt;Slc7a8&lt;/em&gt; was expressed in ILC2s in a tissue-specific manner in steady state and was further increased upon activation. Genetic ablation of &lt;em&gt;Slc7a8&lt;/em&gt; in lymphocytes reduced the frequency of ILC2s, suppressed IL-5 and IL-13 production upon stimulation, and impaired type 2 immune responses to helminth infection. Consistent with this, &lt;em&gt;Slc7a8&lt;/em&gt;-deficient ILC2s also failed to induce cytokine production and recruit eosinophils in a model of allergic lung inflammation. Mechanistically, reduced amino acid availability due to &lt;em&gt;Slc7a8&lt;/em&gt; deficiency led to compromised mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, as well as impaired activation of mammalian target of rapamycin and c-Myc signaling pathways. These findings identify &lt;em&gt;Slc7a8&lt;/em&gt; as a key supplier of amino acids for the metabolic programs underpinning fitness and activation of ILC2s.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tegument protein UL21 of alpha-herpesvirus inhibits the innate immunity by triggering CGAS degradation through TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36343628/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha-herpesvirus causes lifelong infections and serious diseases in a wide range of hosts and has developed multiple strategies to counteract the host defense. Here, we demonstrate that the tegument protein UL21 (unique long region 21) in pseudorabies virus (PRV) dampens type I interferon signaling by triggering the degradation of CGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) through the macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosome pathway. Mechanistically, the UL21 protein scaffolds the E3 ligase UBE3C (ubiquitin protein ligase E3C) to catalyze the K27-linked ubiquitination of CGAS at Lys384, which is recognized by the cargo receptor TOLLIP (toll interacting protein) and degraded in the lysosome. Additionally, we show that the N terminus of UL21 in PRV is dominant in destabilizing CGAS-mediated innate immunity. Moreover, viral tegument protein UL21 in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) also displays the conserved inhibitory mechanisms. Furthermore, by using PRV, we demonstrate the roles of UL21 in degrading CGAS to promote viral infection in vivo. Altogether, these findings describe a distinct pathway where alpha-herpesvirus exploits TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagy to evade host antiviral immunity, highlighting a new interface of interplay between the host and DNA virus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dusp6 deficiency attenuates neutrophil-mediated cardiac damage in the acute inflammatory phase of myocardial infarction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36335128/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) serves a specific and conserved function on the dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). We previously identified Dusp6 as a regenerative repressor during zebrafish heart regeneration, therefore we propose to investigate the role of this repressor in mammalian cardiac repair. Utilizing a rat strain harboring Dusp6 nonsense mutation, rat neutrophil-cardiomyocyte co-culture, bone marrow transplanted rats and neutrophil-specific Dusp6 knockout mice, we find that Dusp6 deficiency improves cardiac outcomes by predominantly attenuating neutrophil-mediated myocardial damage in acute inflammatory phase after myocardial infarction. Mechanistically, Dusp6 is transcriptionally activated by p38-C/EBPβ signaling and acts as an effector for maintaining p-p38 activity by down-regulating pERK and p38-targeting phosphatases DUSP1/DUSP16. Our findings provide robust animal models and novel insights for neutrophil-mediated cardiac damage and demonstrate the potential of DUSP6 as a therapeutic target for post-MI cardiac remodeling and other relevant inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD103 fate mapping reveals that intestinal CD103- tissue-resident memory T cells are the primary responders to secondary infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36332012/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue-resident memory T (T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;) cells remain poised in the tissue and mediate robust protection from secondary infection. T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells within the intestine and other tissues are heterogeneous in their phenotype and function; however, the contributions of these T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; subsets to secondary infection remain poorly defined. To address the plasticity of intestinal T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; subsets and their role in local and systemic immunity, we generated mice to fate map intestinal CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells and track their location and function during secondary infection with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. We found that CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells remained lodged in the tissue and were poorly reactivated during secondary challenge. CD103&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells were the primary responders to secondary infection and expanded within the tissue, with limited contribution from circulating memory T cells. The transcriptional profile of CD103&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells demonstrated maintenance of a gene signature similar to circulating T cells along with increased cytokine production and migratory potential. CD103&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells also expressed genes associated with T cell receptor (TCR) activation and displayed enhanced TCR-mediated reactivation both in vitro and in vivo compared with their CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; counterparts. These studies reveal the limited recall potential of CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; subsets and the role of CD103&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells as central memory–like T cells within peripheral tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Secondary infections rejuvenate the intestinal CD103&#43; tissue-resident memory T cell pool</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36332011/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resident T lymphocytes (T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;) protect tissues during pathogen reexposure. Although T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; phenotype and restricted migratory pattern are established, we have a limited understanding of their response kinetics, stability, and turnover during reinfections. Such characterizations have been restricted by the absence of in vivo fate-mapping systems. We generated two mouse models, one to stably mark CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells (a marker of T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells) and the other to specifically deplete CD103&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Using these models, we observed that intestinal CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells became activated during viral or bacterial reinfection, remained organ-confined, and retained their original phenotype but failed to reexpand. Instead, the population was largely rejuvenated by CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells formed de novo during reinfections. This pattern remained unchanged upon deletion of antigen-specific circulating T cells, indicating that the lack of expansion was not due to competition with circulating subsets. Thus, although intestinal CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; resident T cells survived long term without antigen, they lacked the ability of classical memory T cells to reexpand. This indicated that CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell populations could not autonomously maintain themselves. Instead, their numbers were sustained during reinfection via de novo formation from CD103&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; precursors. Moreover, in contrast to CD103&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cells, which require antigen plus inflammation for their activation, CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; became fully activated follwing exposure to inflammation alone. Together, our data indicate that primary CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; resident memory T cells lack secondary expansion potential and require CD103&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; precursors for their long-term maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bacterial polyphosphates induce CXCL4 and synergize with complement anaphylatoxin C5a in lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36405694/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyphosphates are linear polymers of inorganic phosphates that exist in all living cells and serve pleiotropic functions. Bacteria produce long-chain polyphosphates, which can interfere with host defense to infection. In contrast, short-chain polyphosphates are released from platelet dense granules and bind to the chemokine CXCL4. Here, we report that long-chain polyphosphates induced the release of CXCL4 from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages in a dose-/time-dependent fashion resulting from an induction of CXCL4 mRNA. This polyphosphate effect was lost after pre-incubation with recombinant exopolyphosphatase (PPX) Fc fusion protein, demonstrating the potency of long chains over monophosphates and ambient cations. In detail, polyphosphate chains &amp;gt;70 inorganic phosphate residues were required to reliably induce CXCL4. Polyphosphates acted independently of the purinergic P2Y1 receptor and the MyD88/TRIF adaptors of Toll-like receptors. On the other hand, polyphosphates augmented LPS/MyD88-induced CXCL4 release, which was explained by intracellular signaling convergence on PI3K/Akt. Polyphosphates induced Akt phosphorylation at threonine-308. Pharmacologic blockade of PI3K (wortmannin, LY294002) antagonized polyphosphate-induced CXCL4 release from macrophages. Intratracheal polyphosphate administration to C57BL/6J mice caused histologic signs of lung injury, disruption of the endothelial-epithelial barrier, influx of Ly6G&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; polymorphonuclear neutrophils, depletion of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;SiglecF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; alveolar macrophages, and release of CXCL4. Long-chain polyphosphates synergized with the complement anaphylatoxin, C5a, which was partly explained by upregulation of C5aR1 on myeloid cells. C5aR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice were protected from polyphosphate-induced lung injury. C5a generation occurred in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of polyphosphate-treated C57BL/6J mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate that polyphosphates govern immunomodulation in macrophages and promote acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary edema and hyperemia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary structure disorder, inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone reduces reactive oxygen species generation through increasing expression of nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and objective:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease which has high mortality and lacks effective pharmacological treatments. Excessive inflammation and oxidative stress are the key pathogenesis of ALI. Mefunidone (MFD), a novel small molecule compound, displayed anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress effects on streptozocin (STZ) and db/db mice in our previous studies. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of MFD on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and explore the potential molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the effects of MFD on LPS-induced ALI mouse model and LPS-stimulated immortalized mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MFD could alleviate pulmonary structure disorder and attenuate pulmonary neutrophils infiltration induced by LPS. MFD could also decreased proinflammatory cytokines release and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation stimulated by LPS. Further, MFD could significantly reduce LPS-induced phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), increase expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and restore the expressions of antioxidant enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results firstly supported that MFD effectively protected LPS-induced ALI against inflammation and oxidative stress through inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway and activating Nrf2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles in the pathogenesis and treatment of acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36316787/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are common life-threatening lung diseases associated with acute and severe inflammation. Both have high mortality rates, and despite decades of research on clinical ALI/ARDS, there are no effective therapeutic strategies. Disruption of alveolar-capillary barrier integrity or activation of inflammatory responses leads to lung inflammation and injury. Recently, studies on the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in regulating normal and pathophysiologic cell activities, including inflammation and injury responses, have attracted attention. Injured and dysfunctional cells often secrete EVs into serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with altered cargoes, which can be used to diagnose and predict the development of ALI/ARDS. EVs secreted by mesenchymal stem cells can also attenuate inflammatory reactions associated with cell dysfunction and injury to preserve or restore cell function, and thereby promote cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. This review focuses on the roles of EVs in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation, particularly ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PANoptosis: A Unique Innate Immune Inflammatory Cell Death Modality</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36253067/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate immunity is the first response to protect against pathogens and cellular insults. Pattern recognition receptors sense pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns and induce an innate immune response characterized by inflammation and programmed cell death (PCD). In-depth characterization of innate immune PCD pathways has highlighted significant cross-talk. Recent advances led to the identification of a unique inflammatory PCD modality called PANoptosis, which is regulated by multifaceted PANoptosome complexes that are assembled by integrating components from other PCD pathways. The totality of biological effects observed in PANoptosis cannot be accounted for by any other PCD pathway alone. In this review, we briefly describe mechanisms of innate immune cell death, including molecular mechanisms of PANoptosis activation and regulation. We also highlight the PANoptosomes identified to date and provide an overview of the implications of PANoptosis in disease and therapeutic targeting. Improved understanding of innate immune-mediated cell death, PANoptosis, is critical to inform the next generation of treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Commensal microbiota from patients with inflammatory bowel disease produce genotoxic metabolites</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36302024/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gut microbiota can potentially contribute to the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) by producing small-molecule genotoxins. For example, select commensal &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; strains produce the canonical microbiota-derived genotoxin colibactin, which engenders the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in intestinal epithelial cells and exacerbates CRC in mouse models. Furthermore, human CRCs harbor colibactin-associated mutational signatures, implying a direct role for microbiota-induced DNA damage in CRC. However, the impacts of microbiota-derived genotoxins beyond colibactin remain largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the extensive diversity of small-molecule metabolites produced by bacteria, we hypothesized that additional taxa from the human gut microbiome might produce previously undiscovered small molecules that cause DNA damage in host cells. Identifying and characterizing such genotoxins and their respective biosynthetic pathways may reveal causal roles of gut microbes in shaping host biology and disease susceptibility. Thus, we designed a large-scale electrophoresis-based DNA damage screening pipeline to evaluate the genotoxicity of a collection of more than 100 gut commensals isolated from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified diverse bacteria from the human microbiota whose small-molecule metabolites caused genotoxicity in both cell-free and cell-based DNA damage assays. For example, small-molecule metabolites from gram-positive bacteria (including &lt;em&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Clostridium ramosum&lt;/em&gt; strains) and gram-negative bacteria (including multiple &lt;em&gt;Morganella morganii&lt;/em&gt; strains) directly damaged DNA in cell-free assays and induced the expression of the DSB marker γ-H2AX and cell-cycle arrest in epithelial cells. However, the DNA damage patterns caused by these metabolites were distinct from colibactin-induced cross-links, and these isolates lacked the biosynthetic machinery to produce colibactin or other known genotoxins. These data thus implied the existence of previously unrecognized microbiota-derived genotoxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; is enriched in the gut microbiota of both IBD and CRC patients. Using a combination of comparative metabolomics and bioactivity-guided natural product-discovery techniques, we discovered a family of &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt;-derived small-molecule genotoxins—termed the indolimines—that elicited DNA damage in cell-based and cell-free assays. Furthermore, we identified a previously uncharacterized bacterial decarboxylase (annotated as an aspartate aminotransferase encoded by the &lt;em&gt;aat&lt;/em&gt; gene) that was essential for indolimine synthesis and constructed an isogenic aat mutant &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; that lacked genotoxicity in both cell-free and cell-based DNA damage assays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with the non–indolimine-producing mutant, wild-type &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; caused increased intestinal permeability and induced transcriptional signatures associated with abnormal DNA replication and intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in gnotobiotic mice. Furthermore, indolimine-producing &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; induced increased colonic tumor burden in the context of a mock microbial community in a mouse model of CRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging function-based assessments of the microbiome, we uncovered the existence of a broader universe of microbiota-derived small-molecule genotoxins. We found that diverse bacterial strains isolated from IBD patients exhibited DNA-damaging activities and discovered a previously undescribed family of genotoxins, termed the indolimines, produced by the IBD- and CRC-associated species &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt;. Indolimine-producing &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; caused increased intestinal permeability and exacerbated colon tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic mice. Overall, these studies imply an expanded role for microbiota-derived genotoxins in shaping host biology and disease susceptibility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA H19 via miR-29a-3p is involved in lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis induced by neodymium oxide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure to Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; causes an inflammatory reaction and fibrosis in lung tissue of mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increases H19 and TNFRSF1A levels, decreases miR-29a-3p levels, and activates the NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells and mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;H19 via miR-29a-3p-regulated TNFRSF1A is involved in Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study provide a tool for assessing lung injury risk of Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and other environmental factors that induce inflammatory response and pulmonary fibrosis-associated lncRNAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The occupational and environmental health safety of rare earths has attracted considerable attention. In China, the rare earth neodymium oxide (Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is extensively refined and utilized. However, the mechanisms of Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury are elusive. In the present study, we found that exposure of mice to Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; caused an inflammatory reaction and fibrosis in lung tissues, which was in relation to the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced higher levels of the lncRNA H19 (H19), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFRSF1A), p-p65, and p-IKKβ and lower levels of miR-29a-3p. Further, in mouse monocyte macrophage leukemia cells (RAW264.7), Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; induced an inflammatory reaction, increases of H19 and TNFRSF1A levels, decreases of miR-29a-3p levels, and activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway. Further, we established that miR-29a-3p regulates TNFRSF1A expression. Up-regulation of miR-29a-3p and down-regulation of H19 blocked the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced secretion of TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-6; the increases of TNFRSF1A levels; and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells. Further, in Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-treated RAW26.4 cells, H19 inhibited the expression of miR-29a-3p, which targets TNFRSF1A, and activated the NF-κB signaling pathway to enhance the expression of TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-6. Moreover, for mice, up-regulation of miR-29a-3p reversed lung tissue inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway induced by Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In sum, the present investigation shows that H19 via miR-29a-3p is involved in lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis induced by Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a mechanism for the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung inflammatory response and pulmonary fibrosis. This information is useful for development of a biomarker of Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bclaf1 regulates c-FLIP expression and protects cells from TNF-induced apoptosis and tissue injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TNF stimulation generates pro-survival signals through activation of NF-κB that restrict the build-in death signaling triggered by TNF. The competition between TNF-induced survival and death signals ultimately determines the fate of a cell. Here, we report the identification of Bclaf1 as a novel component of the anti-apoptotic program of TNF. Bclaf1 depletion in multiple cells sensitizes cells to TNF-induced apoptosis but not to necroptosis. Bclaf1 exerts its anti-apoptotic function by promoting the transcription of CFLAR, a caspase 8 antagonist, downstream of NF-κB activation. Bclaf1 binds to the p50 subunit of NF-κB, which is required for Bclaf1 to stimulate CFLAR transcription. Finally, in Bclaf1 siRNA administered mice, TNF-induced small intestine injury is much more severe than in control mice with aggravated signs of apoptosis and pyroptosis. These results suggest Bclaf1 is a key regulator in TNF-induced apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intercellular transfer of activated STING triggered by RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagy promotes antitumor immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36280710/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STING, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein, mediates innate immune activation upon cGAMP stimulation and is degraded through autophagy. Here, we report that activated STING could be transferred between cells to promote antitumor immunity, a process triggered by RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagy. Mechanistically, RAB22A engages PI4K2A to generate PI4P that recruits the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L1 complex, inducing the formation of ER-derived RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagosome, in which STING activated by agonists or chemoradiotherapy is packaged. This RAB22A-induced autophagosome fuses with RAB22A-positive early endosome, generating a new organelle that we name Rafeesome (RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagosome fused with early endosome). Meanwhile, RAB22A inactivates RAB7 to suppress the fusion of Rafeesome with lysosome, thereby enabling the secretion of the inner vesicle of the autophagosome bearing activated STING as a new type of extracellular vesicle that we define as R-EV (RAB22A-induced extracellular vesicle). Activated STING-containing R-EVs induce IFNβ release from recipient cells to the tumor microenvironment, promoting antitumor immunity. Consistently, RAB22A enhances the antitumor effect of the STING agonist diABZI in mice, and a high RAB22A level predicts good survival in nasopharyngeal cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. Our findings reveal that Rafeesome regulates the intercellular transfer of activated STING to trigger and spread antitumor immunity, and that the inner vesicle of non-canonical autophagosome originated from ER is secreted as R-EV, providing a new perspective for understanding the intercellular communication of organelle membrane proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macrophage Sprouty4 deficiency diminishes sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36334381/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation and oxidative stress play critical roles in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Sprout4 (Spry4) is involved in regulating inflammation and tissue injury; however, its role and mechanism in sepsis-induced ALI remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Macrophage-specific Spry4 knockout (Spry4&lt;sup&gt;MKO&lt;/sup&gt;), transgenic (Spry4&lt;sup&gt;MTG&lt;/sup&gt;) mice and matched control littermates were generated and exposed to cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery to establish bacterial sepsis-induced ALI. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Spry4MKO or Spry4&lt;sup&gt;MTG&lt;/sup&gt; mice were isolated and subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation to further validate the role of Spry4 in vitro. To verify the necessity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Spry4 and AMPK double knockout mice and compound C were used in vivo and in vitro. BMDMs were treated with STO-609 to inhibit calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that macrophage Spry4 was increased in CLP mice and positively correlated with sepsis-induced ALI. Macrophage Spry4 deficiency prevented, while macrophage Spry4 overexpression exacerbated sepsis-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and ALI in mice and BMDMs. Mechanistic studies revealed that macrophage Spry4 deficiency alleviated sepsis-induced ALI through activating CaMKK2/AMPK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study identify macrophage Spry4 as a promising predictive and therapeutic target of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>After the Storm: Regeneration, Repair, and Reestablishment of Homeostasis Between the Alveolar Epithelium and Innate Immune System Following Viral Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36270292/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian lung has an enormous environmental-epithelial interface that is optimized to accomplish the principal function of the respiratory system, gas exchange. One consequence of evolving such a large surface area is that the lung epithelium is continuously exposed to toxins, irritants, and pathogens. Maintaining homeostasis in this environment requires a delicate balance of cellular signaling between the epithelium and innate immune system. Following injury, the epithelium can be either fully regenerated in form and function or repaired by forming dysplastic scar tissue. In this review, we describe the major mechanisms of damage, regeneration, and repair within the alveolar niche where gas exchange occurs. With a focus on viral infection, we summarize recent work that has established how epithelial proliferation is arrested during infection and how the innate immune system guides its reconstitution during recovery. The consequence of these processes going awry are also considered, with an emphasis on how this will impact postpandemic pulmonary biology and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Caspase-1 Inhibition Reduces Occurrence of PANoptosis in Macrophages Infected by E. faecalis OG1RF</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the effect of caspase-1 inhibition on PANoptosis in macrophages infected with &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/em&gt; OG1RF. RAW264.7 cells with and without pretreatment by caspase-1 inhibitor were infected with &lt;em&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/em&gt; OG1RF at multiplicities of infection (MOIs). A live cell imaging analysis system and Western blot were applied to evaluate the dynamic curve of cell death and the expression of executor proteins of PANoptosis. The mRNA expression of &lt;em&gt;IL-1β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;IL-18&lt;/em&gt; was quantified by RT-qPCR. Morphological changes were observed under scanning electron microscopy. We found that PI-positive cells emerged earlier and peaked at a faster rate in &lt;em&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/em&gt;-infected macrophages (Ef-MPs) at higher MOIs. The expression of the N-terminal domain of the effector protein gasdermin D (GSDMD-N), cleaved caspase-3 and pMLKL were significantly upregulated at MOIs of 10:1 at 6 h and at MOI of 1:1 at 12 h postinfection. In Ef-MPs pretreated with caspase-1 inhibitor, the number of PI-positive cells was significantly reduced, and the expression of &lt;em&gt;IL-1β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;IL-18&lt;/em&gt; genes and cleaved caspase-1/-3 and GSDMD-N proteins was significantly downregulated (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while pMLKL was still markedly increased (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Ef-MPs remained relatively intact with caspase-1 inhibitor. In conclusion, &lt;em&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/em&gt; induced cell death in macrophages in an MOI-dependent manner. Caspase-1 inhibitor simultaneously inhibited pyroptosis and apoptosis in Ef-MPs, but necroptosis still occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pulmonary delivery of curcumin-loaded glycyrrhizic acid nanoparticles for anti-inflammatory therapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36263591/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disease of the lungs. Curcumin (Cur) shows protective effects in ALI animal models. However, Cur is a hydrophobic drug and its administration into the lungs is inefficient due to its low bioavailability. In this study, glycyrrhizic acid (GA) micelles were produced and evaluated as a carrier of Cur for treatment of ALI. Cur-loaded GA (GA-Cur) nanoparticles were produced using an oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation method. The size and surface charge of the GA-Cur nanoparticles were 159 nm and -23 mV, respectively. In lipopolysaccharide-activated RAW264.7 cells, the GA-Cur nanoparticles decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels more efficiently than GA, Cur, or a simple mixture of GA and Cur (GA + Cur). This suggests that the GA-Cur nanoparticles improved the therapeutic efficiency by enhanced delivery of GA and Cur. GA-Cur inhibited the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κb and induced endogenous heme oxygenase-1 more efficiently than the other treatments. Furthermore, an in vitro toxicity test showed that GA-Cur had little cytotoxicity. In vivo therapeutic effects of GA-Cur were evaluated in ALI mouse models. GA-Cur was administered into the animals by intratracheal instillation. The results showed that GA-Cur reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner and did so more efficiently than GA, Cur, or GA + Cur. Furthermore, the hemolysis and infiltration of monocytes into the lungs were more effectively inhibited by GA-Cur than the other treatments. The data indicate that GA is an efficient carrier of Cur and an anti-inflammatory drug. Owing to their delivery efficiency and safety, GA-Cur nanoparticles will be useful for treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein prevented the progression of acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metabolism in sepsis pathological state was changed after Rhein treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein inhibited the over activation of macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein preconditioning up-regulated and activated SIRT1 signal pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is an organ dysfunction syndrome caused by the maladjustment of response to infection. Acute lung injury (ALI) appears the earliest, with urgent onset and limited treatments. Previous pharmacological studies have found that rhein (RH), an active ingredient rich in rhubarb, has multiple pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-infection and metabolic regulation. This research aimed to explore whether RH alleviates septic acute lung injury and probe possible mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the septic ALI mouse model was established by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). LPS-induced RAW264.7 model was selected to further explore the protective mechanism of RH. H&amp;amp;E staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR, and 1H NMR analysis were used to verify the protective effect of RH on ALI &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; RH could relieve pathological lung injury and pulmonary edema, reduce the serum LPS and inhibit inflammatory response in CLP mice. Further studies displayed that RH affected the metabolism &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, with significant changes in serum and lung metabolomics. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; results demonstrated that RH inhibited the expression of inflammatory mediators and factors in macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming and upregulating the expression of Sirtuin 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; RH improved the overall metabolic condition of sepsis mice by up-regulating and activating SIRT1, and inhibited the over activation of macrophages by regulating metabolism. These findings reveal the therapeutic mechanism of RH on sepsis ALI from the perspective of metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The influenza virus PB2 protein evades antiviral innate immunity by inhibiting JAK1/STAT signalling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36271046/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) polymerase protein PB2 has been shown to partially inhibit the host immune response by blocking the induction of interferons (IFNs). However, the IAV PB2 protein that regulates the downstream signaling pathway of IFNs is not well characterized. Here, we report that IAV PB2 protein reduces cellular sensitivity to IFNs, suppressing the activation of STAT1/STAT2 and ISGs. Furthermore, IAV PB2 protein targets mammalian JAK1 at lysine 859 and 860 for ubiquitination and degradation. Notably, the H5 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus with I283M/K526R mutations on PB2 increases the ability to degrade mammalian JAK1 and exhibits higher replicate efficiency in mammalian (but not avian) cells and mouse lung tissues, and causes greater mortality in infected mice. Altogether, these data describe a negative regulatory mechanism involving PB2-JAK1 and provide insights into an evasion strategy from host antiviral immunity employed by IAV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BP5 alleviates endotoxemia-induced acute lung injury by activating Nrf2 via dual regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and the Akt (Ser473)/GSK3β (Ser9)/Fyn pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress and inflammation play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). Previously, pentapeptide bursopentin (BP5, Cys-Lys-Arg-Val-Tyr) was reported to possess significant antioxidant activity and inhibit lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced NF-κB activation in vitro, whereas little is known about its effects in vivo. In this study, we explored the effects of BP5 on endotoxemia-induced ALI in mice and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our studies revealed that BP5 markedly improved survival and effectively alleviated lung injury by reducing overoxidation and excessive inflammatory response in endotoxemia mice. In LPS-stimulated mouse primary macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells, BP5 also exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties by enhancing Nrf2 activation. Importantly, these beneficial effects were abolished by Nrf2 knockdown. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we performed localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) assays, molecular docking, together with cell-based studies, and found that BP5 inhibited the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction to promote Nrf2 nuclear translocation and activation. Moreover, BP5-induced Nrf2 activation was shown to be accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt (at Ser473) and GSK3β (at Ser9), and a decrease in Fyn nuclear accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacologically inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β obviously enhanced Fyn nuclear accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells, which partially attenuated the promoting effect of BP5 on Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and activation. Furthermore, In Nrf2-/- mice, the protective effects of BP5 on the endotoxemia-induced ALI in WT mice were largely vanished. Our findings indicated that BP5 effectively protected endotoxemia-induced ALI against oxidative stress and inflammatory response, which are largely dependent on activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Underlying mechanisms include dual regulation of the Keap-Nrf2 interaction and the Akt (Ser473)/GSK3β (Ser9)/Fyn pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of environmental factors that promote intestinal inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36266581/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide association studies have identified risk loci linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-a complex chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. The increasing prevalence of IBD in industrialized countries and the augmented disease risk observed in migrants who move into areas of higher disease prevalence suggest that environmental factors are also important determinants of IBD susceptibility and severity. However, the identification of environmental factors relevant to IBD and the mechanisms by which they influence disease has been hampered by the lack of platforms for their systematic investigation. Here we describe an integrated systems approach, combining publicly available databases, zebrafish chemical screens, machine learning and mouse preclinical models to identify environmental factors that control intestinal inflammation. This approach established that the herbicide propyzamide increases inflammation in the small and large intestine. Moreover, we show that an AHR-NF-κB-C/EBPβ signalling axis operates in T cells and dendritic cells to promote intestinal inflammation, and is targeted by propyzamide. In conclusion, we developed a pipeline for the identification of environmental factors and mechanisms of pathogenesis in IBD and, potentially, other inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Memantine nitrate MN-08 suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation to protect against sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36272262/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 significantly increased the survival rate of septic mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 improved SIRS and immune dysfunction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 attenuated septic lung injury and inflammatory infiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 exerts its protection via suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction with devastating consequences, prominent among which is lung damage. Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, is able to alleviate acute lung injury (ALI). Nitric oxide (NO) suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. MN-08, a novel nitrate derivative of memantine, possesses both the ability to antagonize NMDAR and release NO. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of MN-08 against LPS-induced systemic inflammation and septic lung injury in mice, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of MN-08 in LPS-induced mice and THP-1 macrophages. MN-08 significantly increased the survival rate of septic mice, alleviated LPS-induced sepsis in mice via improving systemic inflammatory response syndrome and immune dysfunction, and attenuated pulmonary injury and inflammatory infiltration. More importantly, the therapeutic benefit of MN-08 for sepsis was greater than that of memantine and dexamethasone. Mechanistically, MN-08 exerted anti-inflammatory activity through inhibiting nuclear translocation of NF-κB, activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and the signaling transduction of STAT3/NF-κB. In addition, MN-08 suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that MN-08 may be a promising therapeutic agent for sepsis-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A mouse model characterizes the roles of ZIP8 in systemic iron recycling and lung inflammation and infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36260707/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36260707/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZIP8 knockout mice have elevated spleen iron levels and relative hypoferremia, suggesting that ZIP8 plays a role in iron recycling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While lung ZIP8 is induced with inflammation, ZIP8 deletion in mice had no detrimental effects on acute lung injury or bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZIP8 (SLC39A8) is a transmembrane divalent metal ion importer that is most highly expressed in the lung and is inducible by inflammatory stimuli. In addition to zinc and manganese, ZIP8 can transport iron but its specific roles in iron regulation during homeostatic and pathologic processes remain poorly understood. Using a novel global inducible ZIP8 knockout (KO) mouse, we analyzed the role of ZIP8 in steady-state iron homeostasis and during inflammation and infection. We observed an unexpected phenotype of elevated spleen iron levels and decreased serum iron in ZIP8 KO mice, suggesting that ZIP8 plays a role in iron recycling. We also showed that ZIP8 is expressed on lung distal airspace epithelial cells and transports iron from the airway into lung tissue. LPS-induced inflammation induced ZIP8 expression in the lung, but ZIP8 deletion had no detrimental effect on the severity of LPS-induced acute lung injury or on the outcomes of &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; lung infection. Thus, ZIP8 plays a role in systemic iron homeostasis but does not modulate the severity of inflammatory lung injury or the host defense against a common bacterial cause of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Expansion of T memory stem cells with superior anti-tumor immunity by Urolithin A-induced mitophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36351375/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UA induces Pink1-dependent mitophagy in CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells causing PGAM5 release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cytosolic PGAM5 augments Wnt signaling to drive T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; formation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; induction augments anti-tumor immunity &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Urolithin can be used for &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; expansion of CAR-expressing T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T memory stem cells (T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt;) display increased self-renewal and prolonged survival capabilities, thus preventing T cell exhaustion and promoting effective anti-tumor T cell responses. T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; cells can be expanded by Urolithin A (UA), which is produced by the commensal gut microbiome from foods rich in ellagitannins and is known to improve mitochondrial health. Oral UA administration to tumor-bearing mice conferred strong anti-tumor CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell immunity, whereas &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; UA pre-treated T cells displayed improved anti-tumor function upon adoptive cell transfer. UA-induced T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; formation depended on Pink1-mediated mitophagy triggering cytosolic release of the mitochondrial phosphatase Pgam5. Cytosolic Pgam5 dephosphorylated β-catenin, which drove Wnt signaling and compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis. Collectively, we unravel a critical signaling pathway linking mitophagy to T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; formation and suggest that the well-tolerated metabolic compound UA represents an attractive option to improve immune therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USP15 promotes cGAS activation through deubiquitylation and liquid condensation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36243958/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is recognized as a danger signal by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which triggers innate immune responses. cGAS activity must be properly regulated to maintain immune homeostasis. However, the mechanism by which cGAS activation is controlled remains to be better understood. In this study, we identified USP15 as a cGAS-interacting partner. USP15 promoted DNA-induced cGAS activation and downstream innate immune responses through a positive feedback mechanism. Specifically, USP15 deubiquitylated cGAS and promoted its activation. In the absence of DNA, USP15 drove cGAS dimerization and liquid condensation through the USP15 intrinsic disordered region (IDR), which prepared cGAS for a rapid response to DNA. Upon DNA stimulation, USP15 was induced to express and boost cGAS activation, functioning as an efficient amplifier in innate immune signal transduction. In summary, the positive role played by USP15-mediated cGAS activation may be a novel regulatory mechanism in the fine-tuning of innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5-methylcytosine (m5C) RNA modification controls the innate immune response to virus infection by regulating type I interferons</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36240321/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5-methylcytosine (m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C) is a common RNA methylation. However, its biological functions remain a mystery. Here, we discover that depletion of NSUN2, an m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methyltransferase, leads to an enhanced type I interferon (IFN) response, which significantly inhibits replication of a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses in vitro. Notably, this m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C-mediated antiviral innate immunity is also conserved in an in vivo mouse model. Mechanistically, depletion of the m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methyltransferase decreases the host RNA m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylome and enhances polymerase III–transcribed noncoding RNAs that are recognized by RIG-I to trigger enhanced type I IFN signaling. Our study reveals a role of m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C in regulating innate immunity and highlights m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C as a new target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5-methylcytosine (m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C) is one of the most prevalent modifications of RNA, playing important roles in RNA metabolism, nuclear export, and translation. However, the potential role of RNA m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylation in innate immunity remains elusive. Here, we show that depletion of NSUN2, an m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methyltransferase, significantly inhibits the replication and gene expression of a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses. Notably, we found that this antiviral effect is largely driven by an enhanced type I interferon (IFN) response. The antiviral signaling pathway is dependent on the cytosolic RNA sensor RIG-I but not MDA5. Transcriptome-wide mapping of m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C following NSUN2 depletion in human A549 cells revealed a marked reduction in the m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylation of several abundant noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). However, m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylation of viral RNA was not noticeably altered by NSUN2 depletion. In NSUN2-depleted cells, the host RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcribed ncRNAs, in particular RPPH1 and 7SL RNAs, were substantially up-regulated, leading to an increase of unshielded 7SL RNA in cytoplasm, which served as a direct ligand for the RIG-I-mediated IFN response. In NSUN2-depleted cells, inhibition of Pol III transcription or silencing of RPPH1 and 7SL RNA dampened IFN signaling, partially rescuing viral replication and gene expression. Finally, depletion of NSUN2 in an ex vivo human lung model and a mouse model inhibits viral replication and reduces pathogenesis, which is accompanied by enhanced type I IFN responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that RNA m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylation controls antiviral innate immunity through modulating the m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylome of ncRNAs and their expression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin prevents against LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin attenuates ferroptosis against lps-induced acute lung injury by Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a form of regulated nonapoptotic cell death associated with iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Previous studies have shown that ferroptosis is involved in the occurrence and development of acute lung injury (ALI). In this study, a systems pharmacology approach was performed through the overall process of target acquisition, network construction, and further analysis. Then, the effects of astaxanthin on LPS-induced inflammation and ferroptosis were investigated in RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS in vitro and ALI mice induced by LPS in vivo. The enrichment analysis of astaxanthin-target gene is closely related to the occurrence and development mechanism of ferroptosis. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of astaxanthin acting on ALI found that these intersection genes are associated with ALI inflammatory pathway. In addition, astaxanthin can effectively inhibit LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ferroptosis in RAW264.7 cells. Consistently, administration of astaxanthin protected mice against LPS-induced ALI and significantly decreased the extent of lung edema, inflammatory cells infiltration, and ferroptosis in vivo, and Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is involved in astaxanthin inhibits LPS-induced ALI and ferroptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that astaxanthin inhibit inflammation and ferroptosis by regulating Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to reduce LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 protects PM2.5 exposure-induced lung injury in mice by repressing inflammation and oxidative stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36242005/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Airborne fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) pollution is associated with the prevalence of respiratory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In patients with those diseases, circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels are increased, which contributes to airway nitric oxide deficiency, oxidative stress and inflammation. Overexpression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1), an enzyme degrading ADMA, exerts protective effects in animal models. However, the impact of DDAH1/ADMA on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and DDAH1-transgenic mice, as well as their respective wild-type (WT) littermates, were exposed to either filtered air or airborne PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; (mean daily concentration ~ 50 µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for 6 months through a whole-body exposure system. Mice were also acutely exposed to 10 mg/kg PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and/or exogenous ADMA (2 mg/kg) via intratracheal instillation every other day for 2 weeks. Inflammatory response, oxidative stress and related gene expressions in the lungs were examined. In addition, RAW264.7 cells were exposed to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and/or ADMA and the changes in intracellular oxidative stress and inflammatory response were determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice developed more severe lung injury than WT mice after long-term PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, which was associated with greater induction of pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation. In the lungs of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed mice, &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency increased protein expression of p-p65, iNOS and Bax, and decreased protein expression of Bcl-2, SOD1 and peroxiredoxin 4. Conversely, DDAH1 overexpression significantly alleviated lung injury, attenuated pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation, and exerted opposite effects on those proteins in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed mice. In addition, exogenous ADMA administration could mimic the effect of &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury, oxidative stress and inflammation. In PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed macrophages, ADMA aggravated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in an iNOS-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our data revealed that DDAH1 has a marked protective effect on long-term PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interplay between mucus mobility and alveolar macrophage targeting of surface-modified liposomes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36209941/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alveolar macrophages play a crucial role in the initiation and resolution of the immune response in the lungs. Pro-inflammatory M1 alveolar macrophages are an interesting target for treating inflammatory and infectious pulmonary diseases. One commune targeting strategy is to use nanoparticles conjugated with hyaluronic acid, which interact with CD44 overexpressed on the membrane of those cells. Unfortunately, this coating strategy may be countered by the presence on the surface of the nanoparticles of a poly(ethylene glycol) corona employed to improve nanoparticles&amp;rsquo; diffusion in the lung mucus. This study aims to measure this phenomenon by comparing the behavior in a murine lung inflammation model of three liposomal platforms designed to represent different poly(ethylene glycol) and hyaluronic acid densities (Liposome-PEG, Liposome-PEG-HA and Liposome-HA). In this work, the liposomes were obtained by a one-step ethanol injection method. Their interaction with mucin and targeting ability toward pro-inflammatory macrophages were then investigated in vitro and in vivo in a LPS model of lung inflammation. In vitro, poly(ethylene glycol) free HA-liposomes display a superior targeting efficiency toward M1 macrophages, while the addition of poly(ethylene glycol) induces better mucus mobility. Interestingly in vivo studies revealed that the three liposomes showed distinct cell specificity with alveolar macrophages demonstrating an avidity for poly(ethylene glycol) free HA-liposomes, while neutrophils favored PEGylated liposomes exempt of HA. Those results could be explained by the presence of two forces exercising a balance between mucus penetration and receptor targeting. This study corroborates the importance of considering the site of action and the targeted cells when designing nanoparticles to treat lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modulatory effects of 17β-estradiol on acute lung inflammation after total occlusion of the descending aorta in male rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36252489/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aortic ischemia and reperfusion leads to lung inflammatory activation with edema and leukocyte infiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E2 preventive effects include decreasing of edema, iNOS expression and preventing leukocyte infiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E2 is able to prevent the increased expression of ET-1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our study can be considered is one more step towards using E2 to prevent the local and remote inflammatory response after descending thoracic aorta cross-clamping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of systemic inflammation caused by ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) due to aortic occlusion, the lungs can exhibit increased microvascular permeability, local release of pro-inflammatory mediators, and leukocyte infiltration. Lung tissue infiltration by activated neutrophils is followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is linked to acute pulmonary microvascular damage, high mortality rates, and organ dysfunction. Previous studies have demonstrated that female sex hormones modulate the inflammatory response and that prophylactic treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2) can prevent fatalities and preserve mesenteric perfusion and intestinal integrity after ischemia/reperfusion induced by aortic occlusion. In this study, we focused on the protective effects of estradiol after aortic ischemia/reperfusion by evaluating lung injury and endothelial alterations. Upon anesthesia and mechanical ventilation, male rats were subjected to aortic occlusion for 20 min, followed by 2 h of reperfusion. In parallel, one group of rats received a single injection of estradiol (280 µg/kg, i.v.) 30 min before ischemia. We observed increased serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 in the I/R rats and E2 was able to reduce them. E2 effects after 2 h of reperfusion resulted mainly in decreasing of edema, iNOS expression and preventing leukocyte infiltration. Overall, our data indicate that estradiol might be a supplementary approach to deal with systemic processes and lung deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pharmacodynamic characterization of rytvela, a novel allosteric anti-inflammatory therapeutic, to prevent preterm birth and improve fetal and neonatal outcomes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36244408/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Studies have shown that interleukin 1 plays a major role in the pathophysiology of preterm birth by inducing the production of proinflammatory mediators and uterine activation proteins leading to labor. More importantly, uteroplacental inflammation, associated with preterm birth parturition pathways, is detrimental to fetal tissues and leads to long-term sequelae. Our group has developed an allosteric antagonist of the interleukin 1 receptor, rytvela, found to be potent and safe in preventing preterm birth by suppressing inflammation via the inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway while preserving the Nuclear factor kappa B pathway (important in immune vigilance). Rytvela has been shown to inhibit inflammatory up-regulation and uterine activation while preserving fetal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to further the preclinical development of rytvela by evaluating its optimal dose and minimal duration of treatment to inhibit the inflammatory cascade, prolong gestation, and promote neonatal outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design:&lt;/em&gt; Pregnant CD-1 mice were administered with lipopolysaccharide (10 μg, intraperitoneal administration) or interleukin 1 (1 μg/kg, intrauterine administration) on gestational day 16 to induce preterm labor. Rytvela was administered at different doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 mg/kg/d subcutaneously) from gestational days 16 to 18.5. To evaluate the minimal duration of treatment, the mice were administered with rytvela (2 mg/kg/d subcutaneously) for 24, 36, or 48 hours. The rate of prematurity (gestational day &amp;lt;18.5) and neonate survival and weight were evaluated. Gestational tissues were collected at gestational day 17.5 to quantify cytokines, proinflammatory mediators, and uterine activating proteins by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The neonatal lungs and intestines were collected from postnatal days 5 to 7 and analyzed by histology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Rytvela exhibited a dose-response profile and achieved maximum efficacy at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d by reducing 70% of lipopolysaccharide-induced preterm births and 60% of interleukin 1β-induced preterm births. In addition, rytvela attained maximum efficacy at a dose of 1 mg/kg/d by increasing neonate survival by up to 65% in both models of preterm birth. Rytvela protected fetuses from inflammatory insult as of 24 hours, preserving lung and intestinal integrity, and prevented preterm birth and fetal mortality by 60% and 50%, respectively, as of 36 hours of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The maximum efficacy of rytvela was achieved at 2 mg/kg/d with improved birth outcomes and prevented inflammatory up-regulation upon 36 hours (only) of treatment. Rytvela exhibited desirable properties for the safe prevention of preterm birth and fetal protection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Overproduction of endothelial extracellular vesicles (eEVs) is correlated with pulmonary hypertension progression, but the precise mechanism remains largely unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; MicroRNA-chip and real-time polymerase chain reaction were conducted to screen and validate microRNA profiles in blood plasma eEVs of rats and human with or without cigarette smoking. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were cultured to study signaling pathways. Pulmonary hypertension phenotypes were evaluated in wild-type and calcium-sensing receptor knockout rats to identify the pathophysiological significance of the microRNA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MicroR-1249 was predominant highly expressed in eEVs from plasma of rats exposed to cigarette smoking, and confirmed in eEVs from plasma of human smokers as well as in eEVs from cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery endothelial cells, but not in cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. In cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, microR-1249 downregulated the expression of histone deacetylase 10, which in turn enhanced the acetylated form of NFκB (nuclear factor κB) level and its nuclear translocation leading to increased expression of calcium-sensing receptor. In rats, the repression of microR-1249 in eEVs by microR-1249 inhibitor, histone deacetylase 10 overexpression, or calcium-sensing receptor knockout profoundly inhibited the proliferative capacities and diminished apoptosis-resistance of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and pulmonary hypertension development in rats intravenously administrated with eEVs preparation from cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Cigarette smoke-enriched microR-1249 in endothelial extracellular vesicles facilitates the hyperproliferative and antiapoptotic status of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells promoting pulmonary hypertension evolution through the inhibition of histone deacetylase 10-NFκB-calcium-sensing receptor cascade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schisandrin B protects against LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury by targeting MyD88</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36270224/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a challenging clinical syndrome that manifests as an acute inflammatory response. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a bioactive lignan from Schisandra genus plants, has been shown to suppress inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypothesis/purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study performed an in-depth investigation of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Sch B in macrophages and in an animal model of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; qPCR array was used to probe the differential effects and potential target of Sch B. ALI was induced by intratracheal administration of LPS in experimental mice with or without Sch B treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our studies show that Sch B differentially modulates inflammatory factor induction by LPS in macrophages by directly binding myeloid differentiation response factor-88 (MyD88), an essential adaptor protein in the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) pathway. Sch B spares non-MyD88-pathways downstream of TLR4. Such inhibition suppressed key signaling mediators such as TAK1, MAPKs, and NF-κB, and pro-inflammatory factor induction. Pull down assay using biotinylated-Sch B validate the direct interaction between Sch B and MyD88 in macrophages. Treatment of mice with Sch B prior to LPS challenge reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in lungs, induction of MyD88-pathway signaling proteins, and prevented inflammatory cytokine induction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, our studies have identified MyD88 as a direct target of Sch B for its anti-inflammatory activity, and suggest that Sch B may have therapeutic value for acute lung injury and other MyD88-dependent inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C-X-C-Chemokine-Receptor-Type-4 Inhibitor AMD3100 Attenuates Pulmonary Inflammation and Fibrosis in Silicotic Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36238768/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Silicosis is a severe pulmonary disease caused by inhaling dust containing crystalline silica. The progression of silicosis to pulmonary fibrosis is usually unavoidable. Recent studies have revealed positivity for the overexpression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in pulmonary fibrosis and shown that the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 attenuated pulmonary fibrosis after bleomycin challenge and paraquat exposure. However, it is unclear whether AMD3100 reduces crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 male mice were instilled intranasally with a single dose of crystalline silica (12 mg/60 μL) to establish an acute silicosis mouse model. Twelve hours later, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg AMD3100 or control solution. Then, the mice were weighed daily and sacrificed on day 7, 14, or 28 to collect lung tissue and peripheral blood. Western blotting was also applied to determine the level of CXCR4, while different histological techniques were used to assess pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In addition, the level of B cells in peripheral blood was measured by flow cytometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 were upregulated in the lung tissues of crystalline silica-exposed mice. Blocking CXCR4 with AMD3100 suppressed the upregulation of CXCR4/CXCL12, reduced the severity of lung injury, and prevented weight loss. It also inhibited neutrophil infiltration at inflammatory sites and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, as well as reduced B-lymphocyte aggregates in the lung. Additionally, it decreased the recruitment of circulating fibrocytes (CD45+collagen I+CXCR4+) to the lung and the deposition of collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin in lung tissue. AMD3100 also increased the level of B cells in peripheral blood, preventing circulating B cells from migrating to the injured lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Blocking CXCR4 with AMD3100 delays pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in a silicosis mouse model, suggesting the potential of AMD3100 as a drug for treating silicosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vimentin inhibits type I interferon production by disrupting the TBK1-IKKε-IRF3 axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytoskeleton proteins have been reported to be involved in the host antiviral immune responses. However, how cytoskeleton proteins regulate host antiviral immune responses is not fully understood. Here we report that the cytoskeletal protein vimentin is a negative regulator of type I interferon (IFN-I) production upon viral infection. Ectopic expression of vimentin suppresses RNA- and DNA viruses-induced IFN-I production, whereas knockout of vimentin expression enhances IFN-I production. Viral infection increases vimentin expression and ultimately inhibits IFN-I production. Mechanistically, upregulated vimentin interacts with TBK1 and IKKε to disrupt the interactions of TBK1-IRF3 and IKKε-IRF3, resulting in inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, we generate vimentin knockout mice to confirm that deficiency of vimentin gene in mice suppressed encephalomyocarditis virus replication in vivo. Our findings demonstrates that vimentin plays an important role in regulating IFN-I production, revealing its antiviral function of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lactate induces metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36215678/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased lactate levels in the tissue microenvironment are a well-known feature of chronic inflammation. However, the role of lactate in regulating T cell function remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular lactate predominantly induces deregulation of the Th17-specific gene expression program by modulating the metabolic and epigenetic status of Th17 cells. Following lactate treatment, Th17 cells significantly reduced their IL-17A production and upregulated Foxp3 expression through ROS-driven IL-2 secretion. Moreover, we observed increased levels of genome-wide histone H3K18 lactylation, a recently described marker for active chromatin in macrophages, in lactate-treated Th17 cells. In addition, we show that high lactate concentrations suppress Th17 pathogenicity during intestinal inflammation in mice. These results indicate that lactate is capable of reprogramming pro-inflammatory T cell phenotypes into regulatory T cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>miRNA let-7 family regulated by NEAT1 and ARID3A/NF-κB inhibits PRRSV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36215225/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically devastating diseases affecting the swine industry worldwide. To investigate the role of miRNAs in the infection and susceptibility of PRRS virus (PRRSV), twenty-four miRNA libraries were constructed and sequenced from PRRSV-infected and mock-infected Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) of Meishan, Landrace, Pietrain and Qingping pigs at 9 hours post infection (hpi), 36 hpi, and 60 hpi. The let-7 family miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between PRRSV-infected and mock-infected PAMs from 4 pig breeds. The let-7 family miRNAs could significantly inhibit PRRSV-2 replication by directly targeting the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR of the PRRSV-2 genome and porcine IL6, which plays an important role in PRRSV replication and lung injury. NEAT1 acts as a competing endogenous lncRNA (ceRNA) to upregulate IL6 by attaching let-7 in PAMs. EMSA and ChIP results confirmed that ARID3A could bind to the promoter region of pri-let-7a/let-7f/let-7d gene cluster and inhibit the expression of the let-7 family. Moreover, the NF-κB signaling pathway inhibits the expression of the let-7 family by affecting the nuclear import of ARID3A. The pEGFP-N1-let-7 significantly reduced viral infections and pathological changes in PRRSV-infected piglets. Taken together, NEAT1/ARID3A/let-7/IL6 play significant roles in PRRSV-2 infection and may be promising therapeutic targets for PRRS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sepsis-induced immunosuppression: mechanisms, diagnosis and current treatment options</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a common complication of combat injuries and trauma, and is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It is also one of the significant causes of death and increased health care costs in modern intensive care units. The use of antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and organ support therapy have limited prognostic impact in patients with sepsis. Although its pathophysiology remains elusive, immunosuppression is now recognized as one of the major causes of septic death. Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is resulted from disruption of immune homeostasis. It is characterized by the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, abnormal death of immune effector cells, hyperproliferation of immune suppressor cells, and expression of immune checkpoints. By targeting immunosuppression, especially with immune checkpoint inhibitors, preclinical studies have demonstrated the reversal of immunocyte dysfunctions and established host resistance. Here, we comprehensively discuss recent findings on the mechanisms, regulation and biomarkers of sepsis-induced immunosuppression and highlight their implications for developing effective strategies to treat patients with septic shock.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sulforaphane alleviated vascular remodeling in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension via inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36220525/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH) is a cardiopulmonary disease featured by pulmonary vascular remodeling, which is due to abnormal proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and dysfunction of endothelial cells (ECs). Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural isothiocyanate extracted from cruciferous vegetables with promising anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of SFN on HPH. Male mice were exposed to persistent chronic hypoxia for 4 weeks to induce HPH. The results demonstrated that SFN repressed the increased right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and attenuated the right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary arteries remodeling in HPH mice. In particular, after SFN treatment, the CD68 positive cells in lung sections were reduced; TNF-α and IL-6 levels in lungs and serum declined; activation of NF-κB in PASMCs was inhibited in response to hypoxia. Besides, SFN enhanced the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum, SOD2 expression, total glutathione levels, and GSH/GSSG ratio in PASMCs, along with a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in serum and ROS production in PASMCs after hypoxia exposure. Notably, SFN, as an Nrf2 activator, reversed the reduction in Nrf2 expression in hypoxic PASMCs. In vitro, SFN treatment inhibited hyperproliferation and promoted apoptosis of PASMCs under hypoxia conditions. SFN also prevented the apoptosis of pulmonary microvascular ECs caused by hypoxia. Therefore, these data suggested that SFN could significantly restrain the inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting PASMCs proliferation, promoting PASMCs apoptosis, and reversing hypoxia injury in ECs to improve pulmonary vascular remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell Transcriptomics Reveals Early Molecular and Immune Alterations Underlying the Serrated Neoplasia Pathway Toward Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36216310/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Approximately one-third of colorectal cancers develop from serrated lesions (SLs), including hyperplastic polyp (HP), sessile serrated lesion (SSL), traditional serrated adenoma (TSA), and SSL with dysplasia (SSLD) through the serrated neoplasia pathway, which progresses faster than the conventional adenoma-carcinoma pathway. We sought to depict the currently unclarified molecular and immune alterations by the single-cell landscape in SLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 16 SLs (including 4 proximal HPs, 5 SSLs, 2 SSLDs, and 5 TSAs) vs 3 normal colonic tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 60,568 high-quality cells were obtained. Two distinct epithelial clusters with redox imbalance in SLs were observed, along with upregulation of tumor-promoting SerpinB6 that regulated ROS level. Epithelial clusters of SSL and TSA showed distinct molecular features: SSL-specific epithelium manifested overexpressed proliferative markers with Notch pathway activation, whereas TSA-specific epithelium showed Paneth cell metaplasia with aberrant lysozyme expression. As for immune contexture, enhanced cytotoxic activity of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells was observed in SLs; it was mainly attributable to increased proportion of CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tissue-resident memory T cells, which might be regulated by retinoic acid metabolism. Microenvironment of SLs was generally immune-activated, whereas some immunosuppressive cells (regulatory T cells, anti-inflammatory macrophages, MDK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;IgA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; plasma cells, MMP11-secreting PDGFRA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts) also emerged at early stage and further accumulated in SSLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Epithelial, immune, and stromal components in the serrated pathway undergo fundamental alterations. Future molecular subtypes of SLs and potential immune therapy might be developed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distinct roles of ORAI1 in T cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation and immunity to influenza A virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36206339/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T cell activation and function depend on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals mediated by store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE) through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release-activated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (CRAC) channels formed by ORAI1 proteins. We here investigated how SOCE controls T cell function in pulmonary inflammation during a T helper 1 (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1) cell-mediated response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation. T cell-specific deletion of &lt;em&gt;Orai1&lt;/em&gt; did not exacerbate pulmonary inflammation and viral burdens following IAV infection but protected mice from house dust mite-induced allergic airway inflammation. ORAI1 controlled the expression of genes including p53 and E2F transcription factors that regulate the cell cycle in T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells in response to allergen stimulation and the expression of transcription factors and cytokines that regulate T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell function. Systemic application of a CRAC channel blocker suppressed allergic airway inflammation without compromising immunity to IAV infection, suggesting that inhibition of SOCE is a potential treatment for allergic airway disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of Stimulator of IFN Genes (STING) Causes Proteinuria and Contributes to Glomerular Diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36198430/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The signaling molecule stimulator of IFN genes (STING) was identified as a crucial regulator of the DNA-sensing cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway, and this signaling pathway regulates inflammation and energy homeostasis under conditions of obesity, kidney fibrosis, and AKI. However, the role of STING in causing CKD, including diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and Alport syndrome, is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate whether STING activation contributes to the development and progression of glomerular diseases such as DKD and Alport syndrome, immortalized human and murine podocytes were differentiated for 14 days and treated with a STING-specific agonist. We used diabetic db/db mice, mice with experimental Alport syndrome, C57BL/6 mice, and STING knockout mice to assess the role of the STING signaling pathway in kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, murine and human podocytes express all of the components of the cGAS-STING pathway. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, activation of STING renders C57BL/6 mice susceptible to albuminuria and podocyte loss. STING is activated at baseline in mice with experimental DKD and Alport syndrome. STING activation occurs in the glomerular but not the tubulointerstitial compartment in association with autophagic podocyte death in Alport syndrome mice and with apoptotic podocyte death in DKD mouse models. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of STING protects from progression of kidney disease in mice with DKD and Alport syndrome and increases lifespan in Alport syndrome mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The activation of the STING pathway acts as a mediator of disease progression in DKD and Alport syndrome. Targeting STING may offer a therapeutic option to treat glomerular diseases of metabolic and nonmetabolic origin or prevent their development, progression, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment is a major obstacle in the control of pancreatic and other solid cancers. Agonists of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein trigger inflammatory innate immune responses to potentially overcome tumour immunosuppression. Although these agonists hold promise as potential cancer therapies, tumour resistance to STING monotherapy has emerged in clinical trials and the mechanism(s) is unclear. Here we show that the administration of five distinct STING agonists, including cGAMP, results in an expansion of human and mouse interleukin (IL)-35&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; regulatory B cells in pancreatic cancer. Mechanistically, cGAMP drives expression of IL-35 by B cells in an IRF3-dependent but type I interferon-independent manner. In several preclinical cancer models, the loss of STING signalling in B cells increases tumour control. Furthermore, anti-IL-35 blockade or genetic ablation of IL-35 in B cells also reduces tumour growth. Unexpectedly, the STING-IL-35 axis in B cells reduces proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells and attenuates the NK-driven anti-tumour response. These findings reveal an intrinsic barrier to systemic STING agonist monotherapy and provide a combinatorial strategy to overcome immunosuppression in tumours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electronic cigarette vaping with aged coils causes acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36195745/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been used widely as an alternative to conventional cigarettes and have become particularly popular among young adults. A growing body of evidence has shown that e-cigarettes are associated with acute lung injury and adverse effects in multiple other organs. Previous studies showed that high emissions of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) in aerosols were associated with increased usage of the same e-cigarette coils. However, the impact on lung function of using aged coils has not been reported. We investigated the relationship between coil age and acute lung injury in mice exposed to experimental vaping for 1 h (2 puffs/min, 100 ml/puff). The e-liquid contains propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (50:50, vol) only. The concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in the vaping aerosols increased with age of the nichrome coils starting at 1200 puffs. Mice exposed to e-cigarette aerosols produced from 1800, but not 0 or 900, puff-aged coils caused acute lung injury, increased lung wet/dry weight ratio, and induced lung inflammation (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP-2). Exposure to vaping aerosols from 1800 puff-aged coils decreased heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation in mice compared to mice exposed to air or aerosols from new coils. In conclusion, we observed that the concentration of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) increased with repeated and prolonged usage of e-cigarette coils. Exposure to high levels of aldehyde in vaping aerosol was associated with acute lung injury in mice. These findings show significant risk of lung injury associated with prolonged use of e-cigarette devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influenza A virus infection instructs hematopoiesis to megakaryocyte-lineage output</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IAV infection transiently activates CD41+ HSCs, while EPCR+ CD41− HSCs remain quiescent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD41+ HSCs produce megakaryocytes in IAV-induced emergency megakaryopoiesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platelets generated by IAV-induced emergency megakaryopoiesis are pro-coagulant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IAV-induced emergency megakaryopoiesis is attenuated in IL1R1-deficient mice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory tract infections are among the deadliest communicable diseases worldwide. Severe cases of viral lung infections are often associated with a cytokine storm and alternating platelet numbers. We report that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) sense a non-systemic influenza A virus (IAV) infection via inflammatory cytokines. Irrespective of antiviral treatment or vaccination, at a certain threshold of IAV titer in the lung, CD41-positive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) enter the cell cycle while endothelial protein C receptor-positive CD41-negative HSCs remain quiescent. Active CD41-positive HSCs represent the source of megakaryocytes, while their multi-lineage reconstitution potential is reduced. This emergency megakaryopoiesis is thrombopoietin independent and attenuated in IAV-infected interleukin-1 receptor-deficient mice. Newly produced platelets during IAV infection are immature and hyper-reactive. After viral clearance, HSC quiescence is re-established. Our study reveals that non-systemic viral respiratory infection has an acute impact on HSCs via inflammatory cytokines to counteract IAV-induced thrombocytopenia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular mechanism of RIPK1 and caspase-8 in homeostatic type I interferon production and regulation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36198273/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caspase-8 regulates tonic type I IFN in homeostasis through the RIPK1-TBK1 axis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caspase-8 inhibits the interaction between RIPK1 and TBK1 to regulate type I IFN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When caspase-8 is absent, RIPK1 drives pathogenic IFN production and lymphadenopathy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RIPK1-mediated IFN leads to natural viral resistance when caspase-8 is absent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferons (IFNs) are essential innate immune proteins that maintain tissue homeostasis through tonic expression and can be upregulated to drive antiviral resistance and inflammation upon stimulation. However, the mechanisms that inhibit aberrant IFN upregulation in homeostasis and the impacts of tonic IFN production on health and disease remain enigmatic. Here, we report that caspase-8 negatively regulates type I IFN production by inhibiting the RIPK1-TBK1 axis during homeostasis across multiple cell types and tissues. When caspase-8 is deleted or inhibited, RIPK1 interacts with TBK1 to drive elevated IFN production, leading to heightened resistance to norovirus infection in macrophages but also early onset lymphadenopathy in mice. Combined deletion of caspase-8 and RIPK1 reduces the type I IFN signaling and lymphadenopathy, highlighting the critical role of RIPK1 in this process. Overall, our study identifies a mechanism to constrain tonic type I IFN during homeostasis which could be targeted for infectious and inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reprogramming alveolar macrophage responses to TGF-β reveals CCR2&#43; monocyte activity that promotes bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36189800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a major impediment to lung transplant survival and is generally resistant to medical therapy. Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy that shows promise in stabilizing BOS patients, but its mechanisms of action are unclear. In a mouse lung transplant model, we show that ECP blunts alloimmune responses and inhibits BOS through lowering airway TGF-β bioavailability without altering its expression. Surprisingly, ECP-treated leukocytes were primarily engulfed by alveolar macrophages (AMs), which were reprogrammed to become less responsive to TGF-β and reduce TGF-β bioavailability through secretion of the TGF-β antagonist decorin. In untreated recipients, high airway TGF-β activity stimulated AMs to express CCL2, leading to CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocyte-driven BOS development. Moreover, we found TGF-β receptor 2-dependent differentiation of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes was required for the generation of monocyte-derived AMs, which in turn promoted BOS by expanding tissue-resident memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells that inflicted airway injury through Blimp-1-mediated granzyme B expression. Thus, through studying the effects of ECP, we have identified an AM functional plasticity that controls a TGF-β-dependent network that couples CCR2+ monocyte recruitment and differentiation to alloimmunity and BOS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aberrant methylation of Serpine1 mediates lung injury in neonatal mice prenatally exposed to intrauterine inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36183130/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36183130/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Intrauterine inflammation (IUI) alters epigenetic modifications in offspring, leading to lung injury. However, the epigenetic mechanism underlying IUI-induced lung injury remains uncertain. In the present study, we aim to investigate the effect of IUI on lung development, and to identify the key molecule involved in this process and its epigenetic regulatory mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Serpine1 was upregulated in the lung tissue of neonatal mice with IUI. Intranasal delivery of Serpine1 siRNA markedly reversed IUI-induced lung injury. Serpine1 overexpression substantially promoted cell senescence of both human and murine lung epithelial cells, reflected by decreased cell proliferation and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, G0/G1 cell fraction, senescence marker, and oxidative and DNA damage marker expression. IUI decreased the methylation level of the Serpine1 promoter, and methylation of the promoter led to transcriptional repression of Serpine1. Furthermore, IUI promoted the expression of Tet1 potentially through TNF-α, while Tet1 facilitated the demethylation of Serpine1 promoter. DNA pull-down and ChIP assays revealed that the Serpine1 promoter was regulated by Rela and Hdac2. DNA demethylation increased the recruitment of Rela to the Serpine1 promoter and induced the release of Hdac2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Increased Serpine1 expression mediated by DNA demethylation causes lung injury in neonatal mice with IUI. Therefore, therapeutic interventions targeting Serpine1 may effectively prevent IUI-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Traumatic brain injury alters dendritic cell differentiation and distribution in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36183126/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36183126/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pathophysiological consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) mediated secondary injury remain incompletely understood. In particular, the impact of TBI on the differentiation and maintenance of dendritic cells (DCs), which are regarded as the most professional antigen presenting cells of the immune system, remains completely unknown. Here, we report that DC-differentiation, maintenance and functions are altered on day 3 and day 7 after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Long bones, spleen, peripheral lymph nodes (pLNs), mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), liver, lungs, skin and blood were collected from mice with either moderate-level cortical impact (CCI) or sham on day 1, day 3 or day 7 after TBI. Bone marrow cells were isolated from the tibias and femurs of hind limb through flushing. Tissues were digested with Collagenase-D and DNase I. Skin biopsies were digested in the presence of liberase + DNase I. Single cell suspensions were made, red blood cells were lysed with Ammonium chloride (Stem Cell Technology) and subsequently filtered using a 70 μM nylon mesh. DC subsets of the tissues and DC progenitors of the BM were identified through 10-color flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping studies. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were identified through H2DCFDA staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our studies identify that; (1) frequencies and absolute numbers of DCs in the spleen and BM are altered on day 3 and day 7 after TBI; (2) surface expression of key molecules involved in antigen presentation of DCs were affected on day 3 and day 7 after TBI; (3) distribution and functions of tissue-specific DC subsets of both circulatory and lymphatic systems were imbalanced following TBI; (4) early differentiation program of DCs, especially the commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to common DC progenitors (CDPs), were deregulated after TBI; and (5) intracellular ROS levels were reduced in DC progenitors and differentiated DCs on day 3 and day 7 after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our data demonstrate, for the first time, that TBI affects the distribution pattern of DCs and induces an imbalance among DC subsets in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. In addition, the current study demonstrates that TBI results in reduced levels of ROS in DCs on day 3 and day 7 after TBI, which may explain altered DC differentiation paradigm following TBI. A deeper understanding on the molecular mechanisms that contribute to DC defects following TBI would be essential and beneficial in treating infections in patients with acute central nervous system (CNS) injuries, such as TBI, stroke and spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-9a-5p alleviates ventilator-induced lung injury in rats by inhibiting the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway via CXCR4 expression downregulation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36193608/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I establishment of (ventilator-induced acute lung injury) VILI rat model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used bioinformatics software to predict the target gene of miR-9a-5p, and verified the conclusion through double Luciferase Report experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) through lavage fluid recovery technology for experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Globally, Mechanical ventilation is the most commonly used short-term life support technology. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is an inflammatory injury caused by mechanical ventilation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as new gene regulators that play an important role in lung injury and inflammation. However, the role and mechanism of action of miR-9a-5p in VILI remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Herein, a rat model of VILI was established. To determine the expression levels of miR-9a-5p and CXCR4 mRNA, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were conducted. As well as western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence analyses, we determined the expression of CXCR4, SDF-1 and MAPK signaling pathway-related kinases. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining and the wet-dry ratio of the lung tissue were used to evaluate organ injury. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity measurements were performed to evaluate the inflammatory response. In addition, double luciferase reporter assays were used to verify the association between miR-9a-5p and CXCR4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The expression of miR-9a-5p was low, whereas that of CXCR4 was high in the lung tissues of VILI rats. The overexpression of miR-9a-5p alleviated the degree of pathological injury in the lung tissues of rats with VILI, downregulating inflammatory cytokine expression and MPO activity. In the VILI rat model, miR-9a-5p targeted the negative regulation of CXCR4, and CXCR4 overexpression to reverse the lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of miR-9a-5p overexpression in VILI rats. miR-9a-5p also inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal receptor-activated kinase (ERK), a protein related to the MAPK signaling pathway, by downregulating CXCR4 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; miR-9a-5p can hinder the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and reduce inflammatory reactions and lung injury in VILI rats through the targeted regulation of CXCR4 expression. Therefore, miR-9a-5p could serve as an intervention target to supply a new strategy for the care of VILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Serine metabolism orchestrates macrophage polarization by regulating the IGF1-p38 axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36180780/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serine metabolism is reportedly involved in immune cell functions, but whether and how serine metabolism regulates macrophage polarization remain largely unknown. Here, we show that suppressing serine metabolism, either by inhibiting the activity of the key enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase in the serine biosynthesis pathway or by exogenous serine and glycine restriction, robustly enhances the polarization of interferon-γ-activated macrophages (M(IFN-γ)) but suppresses that of interleukin-4-activated macrophages (M(IL-4)) both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, serine metabolism deficiency increases the expression of IGF1 by reducing the promoter abundance of S-adenosyl methionine-dependent histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. IGF1 then activates the p38-dependent JAK-STAT1 axis to promote M(IFN-γ) polarization and suppress STAT6-mediated M(IL-4) activation. This study reveals a new mechanism by which serine metabolism orchestrates macrophage polarization and suggests the manipulation of serine metabolism as a therapeutic strategy for macrophage-mediated immune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the CtBP complex and FBXO11 enhances MHC class II expression and anti-cancer immune responses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CtBP complex transcriptionally represses MHC class II pathway genes in AML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FBXO11 restricts MHC class II expression by targeting CIITA for degradation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restoring MHC class II expression on leukemic blasts stimulates CD4+ T cell responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inducing tumor cell MHC class II may enhance alloSCT and immunotherapy outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is increasing recognition of the prognostic significance of tumor cell major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression in anti-cancer immunity. Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) has recently been linked to MHC class II silencing in leukemic blasts; however, the regulation of MHC class II expression remains incompletely understood. Utilizing unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we identify that the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) complex transcriptionally represses MHC class II pathway genes, while the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex component FBXO11 mediates degradation of CIITA, the principal transcription factor regulating MHC class II expression. Targeting these repressive mechanisms selectively induces MHC class II upregulation across a range of AML cell lines. Functionally, MHC class II+ leukemic blasts stimulate antigen-dependent CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell activation and potent anti-tumor immune responses, providing fundamental insights into the graft-versus-leukemia effect. These findings establish the rationale for therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring tumor-specific MHC class II expression to salvage AML relapse post-alloSCT and also potentially to enhance immunotherapy outcomes in non-myeloid malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NLRC5 restricts dengue virus infection by promoting the autophagic degradation of viral NS3 through E3 ligase CUL2 (cullin 2)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36126167/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NLRC5 has been reported to be involved in antiviral immunity; however, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the functional role of NLRC5 in the infection of a flavivirus, dengue virus (DENV). We found that the expression of NLRC5 was strongly induced by virus infection and IFNB or IFNG stimulation in different cell lines. Overexpression of NLRC5 remarkably suppressed DENV infection, whereas knockout of NLRC5 led to a significant increase in DENV infection. Mechanistic study revealed that NLRC5 interacted with the viral nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) protease domain and mediated degradation of NS3 through a ubiquitin-dependent selective macroautophagy/autophagy pathway. We demonstrated that NLRC5 recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL2 (cullin 2) to catalyze K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of the NS3 protease domain, which subsequently served as a recognition signal for cargo receptor TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Together, we have demonstrated that NLRC5 exerted an antiviral effect by mediating the degradation of a multifunctional protein of DENV, providing a novel antiviral signal axis of NLRC5-CUL2-NS3-TOLLIP. This study expands our understanding of the regulatory network of NLRC5 in the host defense against virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lycopene attenuates the inflammation and apoptosis in aristolochic acid nephropathy by targeting the Nrf2 antioxidant system</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene improves renal dysfunction in mice with aristolochic acid nephropathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene inhibits oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the kidney of mice with aristolochic acid nephropathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway is critical to inhibit the development of renal inflammatory response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene activates the Nrf2 antioxidant system and then inhibits apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lycopene (LYC) is a carotenoid, has antioxidant properties. This study investigated whether lycopene attenuates aristolochic acids (AAs) -induced chronic kidney disease. In this experiment, lycopene was used to intervene C57BL/6 mice with renal injury induced by aristolochic acid exposure. The histomorphological changes and serological parameters of the kidney were measured in order to assess the alleviating effect of lycopene on renal injury in aristolochic acid nephropathy. In vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to verify the main mechanism of action and drug targets of lycopene in improving aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) and by various experimental methods such as ELISA, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Western-blot and qRT-PCR. The results showed that oxidative stress injury was induced in the kidney of mice after AAI exposure, resulting in inflammatory response and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. The results showed that the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway was inhibited after AAI exposure. AAI induces oxidative stress injury in the kidney, which ultimately leads to inflammation and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. After LYC intervened in the body, it activated Nrf2 nuclear translocation and its downstream HO-1 and NQO1 antioxidant signaling pathways. LYC inhibited ROS production by renal tubular epithelial cells, and alleviated mitochondrial damage. LYC further modulated the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling cascade, thereby reduced the accumulation of inflammatory factors in the renal interstitium. Moreover, LYC was able to up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2, down-regulate Bax expression and inhibit the activation of cleaved forms of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3, which finally attenuated the apoptosis of the mitochondrial pathway induced by AAI exposure. It was concluded that lycopene was able to activate the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway to maintain the homeostasis of renal oxidative stress and ultimately attenuated renal inflammatory response and apoptosis. These results suggested that lycopene can be used as a drug to relieve AAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polysaccharides from &lt;em&gt;Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum&lt;/em&gt; Diels et Gilg (SYQP) attenuated LPS-induced ALI in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYQP exerted anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYQP alleviated ALI by inhibiting TLR4/COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum&lt;/em&gt; Diels et Gilg (Sanyeqing, SYQ), a traditional herb native to China, has been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, febrile convulsions and dysentery. Previous studies have demonstrated the hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects of polysaccharides from SYQ (SYQP). However, the role of SYQP in acute lung injury (ALI) remained unknown. Our present study aimed to explore the protective effects of SYQP in ALI and explained its underlying mechanism. In vivo, Balb/c mice were intragastrically administered with SYQP and dexamethasone (DXMS) for 14 days which were intratracheally instilled (IT) with LPS at the last day. In vitro, A549 cells were pretreated with SYQP, DXMS or TAK-242, following by LPS stimulation for 24 h. The histopathological results showed that SYQP remarkably alleviated pulmonary macrophage infiltration and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels. Additionally, SYQP evidently suppressed wet/dry (W/D) ratio of lung and white blood cells (WBC) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Moreover, SYQP markedly reduced TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and COX-2 levels both in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, SYQP significantly attenuated oxidative stress through upregulating the levels of SOD and GSH-Px and downregulating the expressions of MDA and LDH in vivo, which was confirmed by in vitro results that SYQP could increase SOD activity and decrease MDA and NO contents. Importantly, a decline in protein expressions of TLR4, COX-2, NF-κB p50, phospho-NF-κB p65 and phospho-IκB-α was detected in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our results demonstrated that SYQP ameliorated LPS-induced ALI by alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress via attenuating TLR4/COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single cell analysis of PANoptosome cell death complexes through an expansion microscopy method</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36169732/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to infection or sterile insults, inflammatory programmed cell death is an essential component of the innate immune response to remove infected or damaged cells. PANoptosis is a unique innate immune inflammatory cell death pathway regulated by multifaceted macromolecular complexes called PANoptosomes, which integrate components from other cell death pathways. Growing evidence shows that PANoptosis can be triggered in many physiological conditions, including viral and bacterial infections, cytokine storms, and cancers. However, PANoptosomes at the single cell level have not yet been fully characterized. Initial investigations have suggested that key pyroptotic, apoptotic, and necroptotic molecules including the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC, apoptotic caspase-8 (CASP8), and necroptotic RIPK3 are conserved components of PANoptosomes. Here, we optimized an immunofluorescence procedure to probe the highly dynamic multiprotein PANoptosome complexes across various innate immune cell death-inducing conditions. We first identified and validated antibodies to stain endogenous mouse ASC, CASP8, and RIPK3, without residual staining in the respective knockout cells. We then assessed the formation of PANoptosomes across innate immune cell death-inducing conditions by monitoring the colocalization of ASC with CASP8 and/or RIPK3. Finally, we established an expansion microscopy procedure using these validated antibodies to image the organization of ASC, CASP8, and RIPK3 within the PANoptosome. This optimized protocol, which can be easily adapted to study other multiprotein complexes and other cell death triggers, provides confirmation of PANoptosome assembly in individual cells and forms the foundation for a deeper molecular understanding of the PANoptosome complex and PANoptosis to facilitate therapeutic targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Costunolide covalently targets NACHT domain of NLRP3 to inhibit inflammasome activation and alleviate NLRP3-driven inflammatory diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/apsb.2022.09.014/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NLRP3 inflammasome’s core and most specific protein, NLRP3, has a variety of functions in inflammation-driven diseases. Costunolide (COS) is the major active ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicinal herb &lt;em&gt;Saussurea lappa&lt;/em&gt; and has anti-inflammatory activity, but the principal mechanism and molecular target of COS remain unclear. Here, we show that COS covalently binds to cysteine 598 in NACHT domain of NLRP3, altering the ATPase activity and assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome. We declare COS’s great anti-inflammasome efficacy in macrophages and disease models of gouty arthritis and ulcerative colitis via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We also reveal that the α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone motif in sesquiterpene lactone is the certain active group in inhibiting NLRP3 activation. Taken together, NLRP3 is identified as a direct target of COS for its anti-inflammasome activity. COS, especially the α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone motif in COS structure, might be used to design and produce novel NLRP3 inhibitors as a lead compound.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selenium-enriched soybean peptides pretreatment attenuates lung injury in mice induced by fine particulate matters (PM2.5) through inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB/IκBα signaling pathway and inflammasome generation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35979800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to identify and prepare peptides from selenium (Se)-enriched soybeans and determine whether dietary Se-enriched soybean peptides (Se-SPep) could inhibit lung injury in mice induced by fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups. The mice in the prevention groups were pretreated with 378 mg kg-1 of Se-SPep, soybean peptides (SPep), and Se-enriched soybean protein (Se-SPro), respectively, for four weeks. The mice in the PM2.5 exposure group received concentrated PM2.5 (15 μg per day mice) for 1 h daily from the third week for two weeks. The results showed that the leukocyte and cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the PM2.5 exposure group were higher than those in the control group. Se-SPep pretreatment decreased the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels compared with the PM2.5 exposure group. Additionally, Se-SPep pretreatment inhibited TLR4/NF-κB/IκBα and NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 protein expression in the lungs. In conclusion, Se-SPep pretreatment may protect the lungs of the mice against PM2.5-induced inflammation, suggesting that Se-SPep represents a potential preventative agent to inhibit PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Viral protease cleavage of MAVS in genetically modified mice with hepatitis A virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36152761/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Consistent with its relatively narrow host species range, hepatitis A virus (HAV) cannot infect C57BL/6 mice. However, in &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice with genetic deficiency of the innate immune signaling adaptor MAVS, HAV replicates robustly in the absence of disease. The HAV 3ABC protease cleaves MAVS in human cells, thereby disrupting virus-induced IFN responses, but it cannot cleave murine MAVS (mMAVS) due to sequence differences at the site of scission. Here, we sought to elucidate the role of 3ABC MAVS cleavage in determining HAV pathogenesis and host species range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we established two independent lineages of C57BL/6 mice with knock-in mutations altering two amino acids in mMAVS (&amp;lsquo;mMAVS-VS&amp;rsquo;), rendering it susceptible to 3ABC cleavage without loss of signaling function. We challenged homozygous &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;vs/vs&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice with HAV, and compared infection outcomes with C57BL/6 and genetically deficient &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The humanized murine mMAVS-VS protein was cleaved as efficiently as human MAVS when co-expressed with 3ABC in Huh-7 cells. In embyronic fibroblasts from &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;vs/vs&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, mMAVS-VS was cleaved by ectopically expressed 3ABC, significantly disrupting Sendai virus-induced IFN responses. However, in contrast to &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice with genetic MAVS deficiency, HAV failed to establish infection in &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;vs/vs&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, even with additional genetic knockout of &lt;em&gt;Trif&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Irf1&lt;/em&gt;. Nonetheless, when crossed with permissive &lt;em&gt;Ifnar1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice lacking type I IFN receptors, &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;vs/vs&lt;/sup&gt;Ifnar1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice demonstrated enhanced viral replication coupled with significant reductions in serum alanine aminotransferase, hepatocellular apoptosis, and intrahepatic inflammatory cell infiltrates compared with &lt;em&gt;Ifnar1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; MAVS cleavage by 3ABC boosts viral replication and disrupts disease pathogenesis, but it is not by itself sufficient to break the host-species barrier to HAV infection in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Impact and implications:&lt;/em&gt; The limited host range of human hepatitis viruses could be explained by species-specific viral strategies that disrupt innate immune responses. Both hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis C virus express viral proteases that cleave the innate immune adaptor protein MAVS, in human but not mouse cells. However, the impact of this immune evasion strategy has never been assessed in vivo. Here we show that HAV 3ABC protease cleavage of MAVS enhances viral replication and lessens liver inflammation in mice lacking interferon receptors, but that it is insufficient by itself to overcome the cross-species barrier to infection in mice. These results enhance our understanding of how hepatitis viruses interact with the host and their impact on innate immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Csf2ra deletion attenuates acute lung injuries induced by intratracheal inoculation of aerosolized ricin in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36203597/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific therapeutics are not available for acute lung injury (ALI) induced by ricin toxin (RT). Inhibiting the host immune response in the course of pulmonary ricinosis is hypothesized to be of benefit and can be achieved by impairing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling, thereby reducing the pro-inflammatory response to exogenous foreign body invasion. However, it is unknown whether mice with impaired GM-CSF signaling can survive after RT inhalation. To test this, colony stimulating factor 2 receptor alpha (&lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt;) knockout (KO) mice that lack GM-CSF signaling and wild-type (WT) mice models of intratracheal exposure to a lethal dose (2× LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of RT were established. Survival was greater in &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice 21 days after RT inhalation compared with WT mice. Highly co-expressed genes that probably attenuated the pro-inflammatory response in the lung of &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice were identified. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that transcriptome changes involved mostly inflammation-related genes after RT exposure in both &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice and WT mice. However, the activity levels of pro-inflammatory pathways, such as the TNF signaling pathway and NF-κB signaling pathway, in &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice were significantly decreased and the degree of neutrophil chemotaxis and recruitment inhibited after RT-exposure relative to WT mice. RT-qPCR and flow cytometry validated results of RNA-Seq analysis. This work provides potential avenues for host-directed therapeutic applications that can mitigate the severity of ALI-induced by RT.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFN-γ transforms the transcriptomic landscape and triggers myeloid cell hyperresponsiveness to cause lethal lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36203588/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory disease that is associated with high mortality but no specific treatment. Our understanding of initial events that trigger ARDS pathogenesis is limited. We have developed a mouse model of inflammatory lung injury by influenza and methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) coinfection plus daily antibiotic therapy. Using this pneumonic ARDS model, here we show that IFN-γ receptor signaling drives inflammatory cytokine storm and lung tissue damage. By single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, we demonstrate that IFN-γ signaling induces a transcriptional shift in airway immune cells, particularly by upregulating macrophage and monocyte expression of genes associated with inflammatory diseases. Further evidence from conditional knockout mouse models reveals that IFN-γ receptor signaling in myeloid cells, particularly CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mononuclear phagocytes, directly promotes TNF-α hyperproduction and inflammatory lung damage. Collectively, the findings from this study, ranging from cell-intrinsic gene expression to overall disease outcome, demonstrate that influenza-induced IFN-γ triggers myeloid cell hyperresponsiveness to MRSA, thereby leading to excessive inflammatory response and lethal lung damage during coinfection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophage plasticity is critical for normal tissue repair following injury. In pathologic states such as diabetes, macrophage plasticity is impaired, and macrophages remain in a persistent proinflammatory state; however, the reasons for this are unknown. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing of human diabetic wounds, we identified increased JMJD3 in diabetic wound macrophages, resulting in increased inflammatory gene expression. Mechanistically, we report that in wound healing, JMJD3 directs early macrophage-mediated inflammation via JAK1,3/STAT3 signaling. However, in the diabetic state, we found that IL-6, a cytokine increased in diabetic wound tissue at later time points post-injury, regulates JMJD3 expression in diabetic wound macrophages via the JAK1,3/STAT3 pathway and that this late increase in JMJD3 induces NFκB-mediated inflammatory gene transcription in wound macrophages via an H3K27me3 mechanism. Interestingly, RNA sequencing of wound macrophages isolated from mice with JMJD3-deficient myeloid cells (Jmjd3&lt;sup&gt;f/f&lt;/sup&gt;Lyz2&lt;sup&gt;Cre+&lt;/sup&gt;) identified that the STING gene (Tmem173) is regulated by JMJD3 in wound macrophages. STING limits inflammatory cytokine production by wound macrophages during healing. However, in diabetic mice, its role changes to limit wound repair and enhance inflammation. This finding is important since STING is associated with chronic inflammation, and we found STING to be elevated in human and murine diabetic wound macrophages at late time points. Finally, we demonstrate that macrophage-specific, nanoparticle inhibition of JMJD3 in diabetic wounds significantly improves diabetic wound repair by decreasing inflammatory cytokines and STING. Taken together, this work highlights the central role of JMJD3 in tissue repair and identifies cell-specific targeting as a viable therapeutic strategy for nonhealing diabetic wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is a debilitating systemic inflammation that resulted from infection or injury. Despite many advances in treatment, the resulting mortality rate has remained high due to increasing antibiotic resistance and aging communities. The present study investigated the effects of stem cell-derived exosomes in a mouse model of LPS-induced systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; To induce sepsis, the LPS model was used. Mice were divided into three groups: normal, patient group (LPS + PBS), and treatment group (LPS + exosome). The treatment group received an intravenous exosome 1 h after induction of the model. Patient and treatment groups were sacrificed at 4, 6, 24, and 48 h after induction of the model, and their tissues were isolated. Blood samples were taken from animal hearts to perform biochemical and immunological tests. The study results were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism software version 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes decreased serum levels of ALT and AST liver enzymes, decreased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and improved kidney, liver, and lung tissue damage at 4, 6, and 24 h after model induction. At 24 h, the exosomes were able to reduce serum urea levels. This study revealed decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α after exosome injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings suggest that treating mice with stem cell-derived exosomes can ameliorate the destructive effects of inflammation caused by sepsis by reducing inflammatory factors and tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFN- γ Is Protective in Cytokine Release Syndrome-associated Extrapulmonary Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36125351/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms by which excessive systemic activation of adaptive T lymphocytes, as in cytokine release syndrome (CRS), leads to innate immune cell-mediated acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome, often in the absence of any infection, remains unknown. Here, we investigated the roles of IFN-γ and IL-17A, key T-cell cytokines significantly elevated in patients with CRS, in the immunopathogenesis of CRS-induced extrapulmonary ALI. CRS was induced in wild-type (WT), IL-17A- and IFN-γ knockout (KO) human leukocyte antigen-DR3 transgenic mice with 10 μg of the superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, given intraperitoneally. Several ALI parameters, including gene expression profiling in the lungs, were studied 4, 24, or 48 hours later. Systemic T-cell activation with staphylococcal enterotoxin B resulted in robust upregulation of several chemokines, S100A8/A9, matrix metalloproteases, and other molecules implicated in tissue damage, granulocyte as well as agranulocyte adhesion, and diapedesis in the lungs as early as 4 hours, which was accompanied by subsequent neutrophil/eosinophil lung infiltration and severe ALI in IFN-γ KO mice. These pathways were significantly underexpressed in IL-17A KO mice, which manifested mildest ALI and intermediate in WT mice. Neutralization of IFN-γ worsened ALI in WT and IL-17A KO mice, whereas neutralizing IL-17A did not mitigate lung injury in IFN-γ KO mice, suggesting a dominant protective role for IFN-γ in ALI and that IL-17A is dispensable. Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, increased ALI severity in WT mice. Thus, our study identified novel mechanisms of ALI in CRS and its differential modulation by IFN-γ and IL-17A.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of tocilizumab and dexamethasone on the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of antioxidants in the lungs in oleic acid-induced ARDS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36115998/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening disease caused by the induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs. There is a dearth of drug applications that can be used to prevent cytokine storms in ARDS treatment. This study was designed to investigate the effects of tocilizumab and dexamethasone on oxidative stress, antioxidant parameters, and cytokine storms in acute lung injury caused by oleic acid in rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Adult male rats were divided into five groups: the CN (healthy rats, n = 6), OA (oleic acid administration, n = 6), OA + TCZ-2 (oleic acid and tocilizumab at 2 mg/kg, n = 6), OA + TCZ-4 (oleic acid and tocilizumab at 4 mg/kg, n = 6), and OA + DEX-10 (oleic acid and dexamethasone at 10 mg/kg, n = 6) groups. All animals were euthanized after treatment for histopathological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, PCR, and SEM analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 cytokines in rats with acute lung injury induced by oleic acid were downregulated in the TCZ and DEX groups compared to the OA group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The MDA level in lung tissues was statistically lower in the OA + TCZ-4 group compared to the OA group. It was further determined that SOD, GSH, and CAT levels were decreased in the OA group and increased in the TCZ and DEX groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Histopathological findings such as thickening of the alveoli, hyperemia, and peribronchial cell infiltration were found to be similar when lung tissues of the TCZ and DEX groups were compared to the control group. With SEM imaging of the lung tissues, it was found that the alveolar lining layer had become indistinct in the OA, OA + TCZ-2, and OA + TCZ-4 groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In this model of acute lung injury caused by oleic acid, tocilizumab and dexamethasone were effective in preventing cytokine storms by downregulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. Against the downregulation of antioxidant parameters such as SOD and GSH in the lung tissues caused by oleic acid, tocilizumab and dexamethasone upregulated them and showed protective effects against cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liang-Ge decoction ameliorates acute lung injury in septic model rats through reducing inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and modulating host metabolism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36188538/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liang-Ge decoction (LG) has been used in the treatment of early stage of spesis and can ameliorate sepsis-associated lung injury. However, the mechanism of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury remains unknown. In this study, we established a rat model of sepsis-associated lung injury using the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method, and investigated the therapeutic effects of LG on lung injury in rats with sepsis. In addition, the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury model rats were evaluated. Besides, untargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the regulation of metabolites in rats with sepsis-associated lung injury after LG treatment. Our results showed that LG could decrease the wet/dry (W/D) ratio in lung and the total cell count and total protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in septic model rats. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining showed that LG reduced the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells in lung. In addition, LG treatmment down-regulated the gene and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokins in lung tissue and BALF. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were increased and the level of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) was decreased in lung tissue homogenate in septic model rats after LG treament. Moreover, the numbers of apoptotic cells in lung were reduced and the activity of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) in BALF was decreased in septic model rats after LG treament. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that LG treatment affected the levels of 23 metabolites in lung in septic model rats such as citric acid, methionine, threonine, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, and inositol, these metabolites were associated with the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism and citrate cycle (TCA cycle) pathways. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the therapeutic effetcts of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury model rats. Moreover, LG could inhibit the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis and regulate metabolites related to glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism and TCA cycle in lung in sepsis-associated lung injury model rats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Na/K-ATPase suppresses LPS-induced pro-inflammatory signaling through Lyn</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1 interacts with TLR4 and SFKs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1 restricts LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice injected with LPS show more lung injury and lower survival rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na/K-ATPase (NKA), besides its ion transporter function, is a signal transducer by regulating Src family kinases (SFK). The signaling NKA contributes to oxidized LDL-induced macrophage foam cell formation and interacts with TLR4. However, its role in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced signaling and glycolytic switch in macrophages remains unclear. Using peritoneal macrophages from NKA α1 haploinsufficient mice (NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;), we found that NKA α1 haploinsufficiency led to enhanced LPS-stimulated NF-κB pathway, ROS signaling, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS resulted in more severe lung inflammation and injury with lower survival rate in NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Additionally, LPS induced a higher extent of the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Mechanistically, NKA α1 interacted with TLR4 and Lyn. The presence of NKA α1 in this complex attenuated Lyn activation by LPS, which subsequently restricted the downstream ROS and NF-κB signaling. In conclusion, we demonstrated that NKA α1 suppresses LPS-induced macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling through Lyn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Actin cytoskeleton remodeling primes RIG-I-like receptor activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36113429/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current dogma of RNA-mediated innate immunity is that sensing of immunostimulatory RNA ligands is sufficient for the activation of intracellular sensors and induction of interferon (IFN) responses. Here, we report that actin cytoskeleton disturbance primes RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) activation. Actin cytoskeleton rearrangement induced by virus infection or commonly used reagents to intracellularly deliver RNA triggers the relocalization of PPP1R12C, a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), from filamentous actin to cytoplasmic RLRs. This allows dephosphorylation-mediated RLR priming and, together with the RNA agonist, induces effective RLR downstream signaling. Genetic ablation of PPP1R12C impairs antiviral responses and enhances susceptibility to infection with several RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, picornavirus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. Our work identifies actin cytoskeleton disturbance as a priming signal for RLR-mediated innate immunity, which may open avenues for antiviral or adjuvant design.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial DNA mediates immunoparalysis of dendritic cells in sepsis via STING signalling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36106559/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a potent activator for pro-inflammatory response. Dendritic cells (DCs) are immunosuppressed in sepsis, whether mtDNA mediates immunoparalysis in sepsis remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The mRNAs were assessed by qPCR. Flow cytometry was used to measure the expression of costimulatory molecules and the proliferation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to analyse the expression of proteins. Cytokine secretion was detected by ELISA. Histology of lung tissue was used to assess the inflammatory injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia increased plasma mtDNA levels and immunoparalysis of spleen DCs, while hydrolysing mtDNA reversed immunoparalysis of spleen DCs in vivo. Moreover, cytoplasmic mtDNA of DCs was accumulated in endotoxemia and sepsis. mtDNA transfection into bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) inhibited the expression of costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD40, CD80 and CD86) and the release of IL-12p70, while increasing the secretion of IL-10. Cytoplasmic mtDNA also inhibited the ability of BMDCs to promote the proliferation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Mechanistic analysis revealed that STING signalling was required for mtDNA-mediated immunoparalysis of DCs in vivo and in vitro. Further studies showed deletion of STING reversed mtDNA-mediated immunoparalysis of DCs and improved the prognosis of endotoxemia and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results demonstrated that mtDNA promotes immunoparalysis of DCs, and contributes to sepsis-associated immunosuppression by activating STING signalling. Our study may provide new insights to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of immunosuppressive DCs in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting FoxO transcription factors with HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of osteoarthritis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36109140/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; Osteoarthritis (OA) features ageing-related defects in cellular homeostasis mechanisms in articular cartilage. These defects are associated with suppression of forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors. FoxO1 or FoxO3 deficient mice show early onset OA while FoxO1 protects against oxidative stress in chondrocytes and promotes expression of autophagy genes and the essential joint lubricant proteoglycan 4 (PRG4). The objective of this study was to identify small molecules that can increase FoxO1 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We constructed a reporter cell line with FoxO1 promoter sequences and performed high-throughput screening (HTS) of the Repurposing, Focused Rescue and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) library . Hits from the HTS were validated and function was assessed in human chondrocytes, meniscus cells and synoviocytes and following administration to mice. The most promising hit, the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) panobinostat was tested in a murine OA model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Among the top hits were HDACI and testing in human chondrocytes, meniscus cells and synoviocytes showed that panobinostat was the most promising compound as it increased the expression of autophagy genes and PRG4 while suppressing the basal and IL-1β induced expression of inflammatory mediators and extracellular matrix degrading enzymes. Intraperitoneal administration of panobinostat also suppressed the expression of mediators of OA pathogenesis induced by intra-articular injection of IL-1β. In a murine OA model, panobinostat reduced the severity of histological changes in cartilage, synovium and subchondral bone and improved pain behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Panobinostat has a clinically relevant activity profile and is a candidate for OA symptom and structure modification.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammatory responses contribute to the pathogenesis and lethality of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the N proteins of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), were found to bind MASP-2, a key serine protease in the lectin pathway of complement activation, resulting in excessive complement activation by potentiating MBL-dependent MASP-2 activation, and the deposition of MASP-2, C4b, activated C3 and C5b-9. Aggravated inflammatory lung injury was observed in mice infected with adenovirus expressing the N protein. Complement hyperactivation was also observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Either blocking the N protein:MASP-2 interaction, MASP-2 depletion or suppressing complement activation can significantly alleviate N protein-induced complement hyperactivation and lung injury in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, these data suggested that complement suppression may represent a novel therapeutic approach for pneumonia induced by these highly pathogenic coronaviruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 exposure altered gut microbiome and influences the balance of Th17/Treg cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The changes of gut microbiome and the imbalance of Th17/Treg cell are critical mechanism of PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The administration of Probiotics regulating Th17/Treg cell balance and gut microbiome attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imbalance of intestinal microbiota and inflammatory response is crucial in the development of lung injury induced by PM2.5. In recent years, probiotics have attracted great attention for their health benefits in inflammatory diseases and regulating intestinal balance, but their intricate mechanisms need further experiments to elucidate. In our research, a rat lung damage model induced by PM2.5 exposure in real environment was established to explore the protective properties of probiotics on PM2.5 exposure injury and its related mechanism. The results indicated that compared with the AF control group, rats in the PM2.5 group gained weight slowly, ate less and had yellow hair. The results of pathological and immunohistochemical examinations showed that the inflammatory infiltration of lung tissue was alleviated after probiotic treatment. The Lung function results also showed the improvement effects of probiotics administration. In addition, probiotics could promote the balance of Th17 and Treg cells, inhibit cytokines expression (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17A), and increase the concentration of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10, TGF-β). In addition, 16 S rRNA sequence analysis showed that probiotic treatment could reduce microbiota abundance and diversity, increase the abundance of possible beneficial bacteria, and decrease the abundance of bacteria associated with inflammation. In general, probiotic intervention was found to have preventive effects on the occurrence of PM2.5 induced pathological injury, and the mechanism was associate with to the inhibition of inflammatory response, regulation of Th17/Treg balance and maintenance of intestinal internal environment stability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Systemic interleukin-6 inhibition ameliorates acute neuropsychiatric phenotypes in a murine model of acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute neuropsychiatric impairments occur in over 70% of patients with acute lung injury. Mechanical ventilation is a well-known precipitant of acute lung injury and is strongly associated with the development of acute delirium and anxiety phenotypes. In prior studies, we demonstrated that IL-6 mediates neuropathological changes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of animals with mechanical ventilation-induced brain injury; however, the effect of systemic IL-6 inhibition on structural and functional acute neuropsychiatric phenotypes is not known. We hypothesized that a murine model of mechanical ventilation-induced acute lung injury (VILI) would induce neural injury to the amygdala and hippocampus, brain regions that are implicated in diverse neuropsychiatric conditions, and corresponding delirium- and anxiety-like functional impairments. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these structural and functional changes would reverse with systemic IL-6 inhibition. VILI was induced using high tidal volume (35 cc/kg) mechanical ventilation. Cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) expression was quantified as a neural injury marker and found to be significantly increased in the VILI group compared to spontaneously breathing or anesthetized and mechanically ventilated mice with 10 cc/kg tidal volume. VILI mice treated with systemic IL-6 inhibition had significantly reduced amygdalar and hippocampal CC3 expression compared to saline-treated animals and demonstrated amelioration in acute neuropsychiatric behaviors in open field, elevated plus maze, and Y-maze tests. Overall, these data provide evidence of a pathogenic role of systemic IL-6 in mediating structural and functional acute neuropsychiatric symptoms in VILI and provide preclinical justification to assess IL-6 inhibition as a potential intervention to ameliorate acute neuropsychiatric phenotypes following VILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>H1N1 influenza virus dose dependent induction of dysregulated innate immune responses and STAT1/3 activation are associated with pulmonary immunopathological damage</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36082929/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infection poses a substantial challenge and causes high morbidity and mortality. Exacerbated pulmonary inflammatory responses are the major causes of extensive diffuse alveolar immunopathological damage. However, the relationship between the extent of cytokine storm, neutrophils/macrophages infiltration, and different IAV infection dose and time still needs to be further elucidated, and it is still unclear whether the signal transduction and transcriptional activator 1/3 (STAT1/3) signalling pathway plays a beneficial or detrimental role. Here, we established a mouse model of high- and low-dose pH1N1 infection. We found that pH1N1 infection induced robust and early pathological damage and cytokine storm in an infection dose- and time-dependent manner. High-dose pH1N1 infection induced massive and sustained recruitment of neutrophils as well as a higher ratio of M1:M2, which may contribute to severe lung immunopathological damage. pH1N1 infection activated dose- and time-dependent STAT1 and STAT3. Inhibition of STAT1 and/or STAT3 aggravated low-dose pH1N1 infection, induced lung damage, and decreased survival rate. Appropriate activation of STAT1/3 provided survival benefits and pathological improvement during low-dose pH1N1 infection. These results demonstrate that high-dose pH1N1 infection induces robust and sustained neutrophil infiltration, imbalanced macrophage polarization, excessive and earlier cytokine storm, and STAT1/3 activation, which are associated with pulmonary dysregulated proinflammatory responses and progress of acute lung injury. The severe innate immune responses may be the threshold at which protective functions give way to immunopathology, and assessing the magnitude of host innate immune responses is necessary in adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy for alleviating influenza-induced pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transient RNA structures cause aberrant influenza virus replication and innate immune activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36083899/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During infection, the influenza A virus RNA polymerase produces both full-length and aberrant RNA molecules, such as defective viral genomes (DVGs) and mini viral RNAs (mvRNAs). Subsequent innate immune activation involves the binding of host pathogen receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) to viral RNAs. However, it is not clear what factors determine which influenza A virus RNAs are RIG-I agonists. Here, we provide evidence that RNA structures, called template loops (t-loops), stall the viral RNA polymerase and contribute to innate immune activation by mvRNAs during influenza A virus infection. Impairment of replication by t-loops depends on the formation of an RNA duplex near the template entry and exit channels of the RNA polymerase, and this effect is enhanced by mutation of the template exit path from the RNA polymerase active site. Overall, these findings are suggestive of a mechanism involving polymerase stalling that links aberrant viral replication to the activation of the innate immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>E-prostanoid 3 receptor deficiency on myeloid cells protects against ischemic acute kidney injury via breaking the auto-amplification loop of necroinflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36087809/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necroinflammation plays an important role in disease settings such as acute kidney injury (AKI). We and others have elucidated that prostaglandins, which are critically involved in inflammation, may activate E-prostanoid 3 receptor (EP3) at low concentrations. However, how EP3 blockade interacts with regulated cell death and affects AKI remains unknown. In this study, AKI was induced by ischemia-reperfusion (30 minutes/24 hours) in Ep3 knockout (&lt;em&gt;Ep3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), bone marrow chimeric, myeloid conditional EP3 knockout and corresponding control mice. The production of prostaglandins E2 and I2 was markedly increased after ischemia-reperfusion, and either abrogation or antagonism of EP3 ameliorated the injury. EP3 deficiency curbed inflammatory cytokine release, neutrophil infiltration and serum high-mobility group box 1 levels, but additional TLR4 inhibition with TAK-242 did not offer further protection against the injury and inflammation. The protection of &lt;em&gt;Ep3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was predominantly mediated by suppressing Mixed Lineage Kinase domain-Like-dependent necroptosis, resulting from the inhibition of cytokine generation and the switching of cell death modality from necroptosis to apoptosis through caspase-8 up-regulation, in part due to the restraint of IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling. EP3 deficiency failed to further alleviate the injury when necroptosis was inhibited. &lt;em&gt;Ep3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in bone marrow-derived cells, particularly that in myeloid cells, protected kidneys to the same extent as that of global EP3 deletion. Thus, our results demonstrate that EP3 deficiency especially that on myeloid cells, ameliorates ischemic AKI via curbing inflammation and breaking the auto-amplification loop of necroinflammation. Hence, EP3 may be a promising target for the prevention and/or treatment of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Injury-induced pulmonary tuft cells are heterogenous, arise independent of key Type 2 cytokines, and are dispensable for dysplastic repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36073526/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the lung bears significant regenerative capacity, severe viral pneumonia can chronically impair lung function by triggering dysplastic remodeling. The connection between these enduring changes and chronic disease remains poorly understood. We recently described the emergence of tuft cells within Krt5+ dysplastic regions after influenza injury. Using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, we characterized and delineated multiple distinct tuft cell populations that arise following influenza clearance. Distinct from intestinal tuft cells which rely on Type 2 immune signals for their expansion, neither IL-25 nor IL-4ra signaling are required to drive tuft cell development in dysplastic/injured lungs. In addition, tuft cell expansion occurred independently of type I or type III interferon signaling. Furthermore, tuft cells were also observed upon bleomycin injury, suggesting that their development may be a general response to severe lung injury. While intestinal tuft cells promote growth and differentiation of surrounding epithelial cells, in the lungs of tuft cell deficient mice, Krt5+ dysplasia still occurs, goblet cell production is unchanged, and there remains no appreciable contribution of Krt5+ cells into more regionally appropriate alveolar Type 2 cells. Together, these findings highlight unexpected differences in signals necessary for murine lung tuft cell amplification and establish a framework for future elucidation of tuft cell functions in pulmonary health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal microbiota metabolizing Houttuynia cordata polysaccharides in H1N1 induced pneumonia mice contributed to Th17/Treg rebalance in gut-lung axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus is intricately linked to dysregulation of gut microbiota and host immunity. Previous study revealed that Houttuynia cordata polysaccharides (HCP) exert the therapeutic effect on influenza A virus inducing lung and intestine damage via regulating pulmonary and intestinal mucosal immunity. However, whether this result was due to the regulation of gut microbiota in the gut-lung axis remains unclear. Here, we firstly found that the elimination of gut microbiota using antibiotic cocktails led to both loss of the protective effect of HCP on intestine and lung injury, and reduction of the efficacy on regulating Th17/Treg balance in gut-lung axis. Fecal microbiota transplantation study confirmed that the gut microbiota fermented with HCP under pathological conditions (H1N1 infection) was responsible for reducing pulmonary and intestinal injury. Moreover, the interaction of HCP and gut microbiota under pathological conditions exhibited not only much more abundant gut microbial diversity, but also higher content of the acetate. Our results demonstrated that the underlying mechanism to ameliorate viral pneumonia in mice involving Th17/Treg rebalance via the gut microbiota and HCP metabolite (acetate) metabolized in pneumonia mice. Our results provided a new insight for macromolecular polysaccharides through targeting intestinal microenvironment reducing distant pulmonary infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The immunostimulatory molecule cGAMP is actively exported from live cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABCC1 mediates active, ATP-dependent cGAMP export&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABCC1-mediated cGAMP export limits activation of the STING-interferon pathway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABCC1 limits cGAS-dependent autoimmunity in vivo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is important for antiviral and anti-tumor immunity. cGAS generates cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a diffusible cyclic dinucleotide that activates the antiviral response through the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING). cGAMP cannot passively cross cell membranes, but recent advances have established a role for extracellular cGAMP as an &amp;ldquo;immunotransmitter&amp;rdquo; that can be imported into cells. However, the mechanism by which cGAMP exits cells remains unknown. Here, we identifed ABCC1 as a direct, ATP-dependent cGAMP exporter in mouse and human cells. We show that ABCC1 overexpression enhanced cGAMP export and limited STING signaling and that loss of ABCC1 reduced cGAMP export and potentiated STING signaling. We demonstrate that ABCC1 deficiency exacerbated cGAS-dependent autoimmunity in the Trex1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Thus, ABCC1-mediated cGAMP export is a key regulatory mechanism that limits cell-intrinsic activation of STING and ameliorates STING-dependent autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections can compromise the physical and biological functionalities of humans and pose a huge economical and psychological burden on infected patients. Nitric oxide (NO) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, whose mechanism of action is not affected by bacterial resistance. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an endogenous donor and carrier of NO, has gained increasing attention because of its potent antibacterial activity and efficient biocompatibility. Significant breakthroughs have been made in the application of GSNO in biomaterials. This review is based on the existing evidence that comprehensively summarizes the progress of antimicrobial GSNO applications focusing on their anti-infective performance, underlying antibacterial mechanisms, and application in anti-infective biomaterials. We provide an accurate overview of the roles and applications of GSNO in antibacterial biomaterials and shed new light on the avenues for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a major type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which could induce bloody stool, diarrhea, colon atrophy and eventually lead to colorectal cancer. The conventional daily oral administration of drugs only relieve the inflammatory response of colon in the short term, Biological agents such as antibody drugs has proven its efficiency in inhibiting colitis, while the low drug bioavailability means that large doses of antibodies are required, ultimately causing systemic toxicity. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has significant advantages over antibody drugs in terms of safety and efficacy, and it have been widely applied as potential candidates for a variety of inflammation-related diseases. However, oral delivery of siRNA fails to overcome the degradation of the gastrointestinal environment to produce a significant therapeutic effect in ulcerative colitis. Herein, we design the hybrid delivery system that the siRNA loaded MOF encapsulated in the sodium alginate particles to overcome the barriers in the oral process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The hybrid delivery system (SA@MOF-siRNA&lt;sup&gt;TNFα&lt;/sup&gt;) was successfully constructed, and it could not only survive the low pH environment in the stomach and small intestine, but also taken up more by inflammatory macrophages, as well as released much more MOF-siRNA&lt;sup&gt;TNFα&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, SA@MOF-siRNA&lt;sup&gt;TNFα&lt;/sup&gt; tended to enriched and infiltrated into local colon tissues. As a result, SA@MOF-siRNA&lt;sup&gt;TNFα&lt;/sup&gt; significantly reduced the progression of colitis, of which the treated mice did not experience significant weight loss, bloody stools and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We confirmed that the formulation of hydrogel-metal-organic framework hybrids could improve the protection of incorporated payload in the gastric and early small intestine, enhancing the delivery of MOF-siRNA to colon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation and oxidative stress lead to various acute or chronic diseases, including pneumonia, liver and kidney injury, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer. Ginseng is a well-known and widely used ethnic medicine in Asian countries, and ginsenoside Rg3 is a saponin isolated from &lt;em&gt;Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Panax notoginseng&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Panax quinquefolius L&lt;/em&gt;. This compound has a wide range of pharmacological properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, which have been evaluated in disease models of inflammation and oxidative stress. Rg3 can attenuate lung inflammation, prevent liver and kidney function damage, mitigate neuroinflammation, prevent cerebral and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, and improve hypertension and diabetes symptoms. The multitarget, multipathway mechanisms of action of Rg3 have been gradually deciphered. This review summarizes the existing knowledge on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of ginsenoside Rg3, suggesting that ginsenoside Rg3 may be a promising candidate drug for the treatment of diseases with inflammatory and oxidative stress conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic life-long inflammatory disease affecting almost 2 million Americans. Although new biologic therapies have been developed, the standard medical treatment fails to selectively control the dysregulated immune pathways involved in chronic colonic inflammation. Further, IBD patients with uncontrolled colonic inflammation are at a higher risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Intestinal microbes can impact many immune functions, and here we asked if they could be used to improve intestinal inflammation. By utilizing an intestinal adherent &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that we find increases IL-10 producing macrophages, we were able to limit intestinal inflammation and restrict tumor formation. Macrophage IL-10 along with IL-10 signaling to the intestinal epithelium were required for protection in both inflammation and tumor development. Our work highlights that administration of immune modulating microbes can improve intestinal outcomes by altering tissue inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Factor H related proteins modulate complement activation on kidney cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36063874/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complement activation at a particular location is determined by the balance of activating and inhibitory proteins. Factor H is a key regulator of the alternative pathway of complement, and genetic or acquired impairments in Factor H are associated with glomerular injury. The human Factor H–related proteins (FHRs) comprise a family of five proteins that are structurally related to Factor H. Variations in the genes or expression levels of the FHRs are also associated with glomerular disease, although the mechanisms of glomerular protection/injury are incompletely understood. To explore the role of the FHRs on complement regulation/dysregulation in the kidney, we expressed and purified recombinant murine FHRs (FHRs A, B, C and E). These four distinct FHRs contain binding regions with high amino acid sequence homology to binding regions within Factor H, but we observed different interactions of the FHRs with Factor H binding ligands, including heparin and C3d. There was differential binding of the FHRs to the resident kidney cell types (mesangial, glomerular endothelial, podocytes, and tubular epithelial). All four FHRs caused complement dysregulation on kidney cell surfaces &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, although the magnitude of the effect differed among the FHRs and also varied among the different kidney cells. However, only FHR E caused glomerular complement dysregulation when injected &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; but did not exacerbate injury when injected into mice with ischemic acute kidney injury, an alternative pathway-mediated model. Thus, our experiments demonstrate that the FHRs have unique, and likely context-dependent, effects on the different cell types within the kidney.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms of Zedoary Turmeric Oil Injection against lipopolysaccharides-induced acute lung injury in rats elucidated by network pharmacology combined with transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36099655/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Prospects for the drug treatment of acute lung injury (ALI) is unpromising. Managing inflammation can prevent ALI from progressing and minimize further deterioration. Zedoary turmeric oil injection (ZTOI), a patented traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that has been used against ALI, has shown significant anti-inflammatory effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism by which ZTOI acts against ALI in rats using an ingredients-targets-pathways (I-T-P) interaction network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design and methods:&lt;/em&gt; The key ingredients of ZTOI were characterized using UPLC-MS/MS combined with literature mining. The target profiles of each ingredient were established using drug-target databases. The anti-inflammatory activity of ZTOI against lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced rat ALI was validated using histopathology and inflammatory factor assessments. The therapeutic targets of ZTOI were screened by integrating transcriptomic results of lung tissues with protein-protein interaction (PPI) expansion. Using KEGG pathway enrichment, an I-T-P network was established to determine the essential interactions among ingredients, targets, and pathways of ZTOI against lung inflammation in ALI. Molecular docking and immunofluorescence staining were utilized to confirm the accuracy of the I-T-P network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 11 sesquiterpenes, whose target profiles may characterize the potential function of ZTOI, were identified as key ingredients. In the ALI rat model, ZTOI can alleviate lung inflammation by decreasing the levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α both in serum and lung tissues. Based on our biological samples, transcriptomics, PPI network expansion, and KEGG pathway enrichment, 11 ingredients, 174 targets, and 8 signaling pathways were linked in the I-T-P networks. From these results, ZTOI could be inferred to exert multiple anti-inflammatory effects against ALI through Toll-like receptor, NF-kappa B, RIG-I-like receptor, TNF, NOD-like receptor, IL-17, MAPK, and the Toll and Imd signaling pathways. In addition, two significantly regulated targets in the transcriptome, Usp18 and Map3k7, could be the essential anti-inflammatory targets of ZTOI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; By integrating network pharmacology with ingredient identification and transcriptomics, we show the multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms by which ZTOI acts against ALI on an I-T-P level. This work also provides a methodological reference for related research into TCM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poldip2 knockdown protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via Nox4/Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36120334/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymerase δ-interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) has been reported to mediate acute lung injury (ALI); however, the underlying mechanism is not fully explored. Male C57BL/6 mice and A549 cells were used to establish the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model, then the expression of Poldip2 and its effect on oxidative stress and the resulting inflammation were detected. Adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) mediated Poldip2 knockdown was transfected into mice via intratracheal atomization. And A549 cells stimulated with LPS was used to further confirm our hypothesis in vitro. ML385, specifically inhibited the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Our data suggested that LPS stimulation remarkably increased protein levels of Nox4 and p-P65, activities of NADPH and MPO, and generation of ROS, TNF-α, and IL-1β while decreased protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 compared with those in NC shRNA + Saline group, which were obviously reversed by Poldip2 knockdown. Concomitantly, Poldip2 knockdown dramatically reduced contents of MDA and enhanced activities of SOD and GSH-Px compared to NC shRNA + LPS group. In vitro, we found that knockdown of Poldip2 significantly reversed LPS-induced increase protein levels of Nox4 and p-P65, activity of NADPH, and generation of ROS, TNF-α, and IL-1β, and decrease protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1, ML385 pretreatment reversed the effects of Poldip2 knockdown mentioned above. Our study indicated that Poldip2 knockdown alleviates LPS-induced ALI via inhibiting Nox4/Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diacerein attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ER stress and apoptosis: Impact on the crosstalk between SphK1/S1P, TLR4/NFκB/STAT3, and NLRP3/IL-1β signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36055546/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening clinical problem with high mortality rate and limited treatments or preventive options that represents a major challenge for clinicians. Diacerein (DIA) is a multi-target anthraquinone derivative with potent anti-inflammatory action. The aim of this study is to assess the protective effect of DIA and its potential molecular targets against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administrated DIA (50 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (5mg/kg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; DIA mitigated oxidative lung injury in LPS-challenged rats via significantly decreasing lung wet/dry (W/D) ratio, inflammatory cells infiltration, and lipid peroxidation, with concomitant elevation in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels in lung tissue. Likewise, DIA alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress and markedly halted inflammation triggered by LPS challenge in pulmonary tissue by suppressing NLRP3/IL-1β and TLR4/NF-κB signaling with parallel decrease in proinflammatory cytokine levels. Interestingly, DIA down regulated Sphk1/S1P axis, reduced GSK-3β and STAT3 proteins expression, and markedly decreased caspase-3 besides increasing Bcl-2 levels in lung tissue of LPS-challenged animals. These biochemical findings was simultaneously associated with marked improvement in histological alterations of lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; These findings verify the protective effect of DIA against LPS-induced ALI through targeting oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis. Importantly, DIA halted the hyperinflammatory state triggered by LPS via multi-faceted inhibitory effect on different signaling pathways, hence DIA could potentially reduce mortality in patients with ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel Requirement for Staphylococcal Cell Wall-Anchored Protein SasD in Pulmonary Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36040164/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; can complicate preceding viral infections, including influenza virus. A bacterial infection combined with a preceding viral infection, known as superinfection, leads to worse outcomes than a single infection. Most of the pulmonary infection literature focuses on the changes in immune responses to bacteria between homeostatic and virally infected lungs. However, it is unclear how much of an influence bacterial virulence factors have in single or superinfection. Staphylococcal species express a broad range of cell wall-anchored proteins (CWAs) that have roles in host adhesion, nutrient acquisition, and immune evasion. We screened the importance of these CWAs using mutants lacking individual CWAs in vivo in both bacterial pneumonia and influenza superinfection. In bacterial pneumonia, the lack of individual CWAs leads to various decreases in bacterial burden, lung damage, and immune infiltration into the lung. However, the presence of a preceding influenza infection partially abrogates the requirement for CWAs. In the screen, we found that the uncharacterized CWA &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; surface protein D (SasD) induced changes in both inflammatory and homeostatic lung markers. We further characterized a SasD mutant (sasD A50.1) in the context of pneumonia. Mice infected with sasD A50.1 have decreased bacterial burden, inflammatory responses, and mortality compared to wild-type &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;. Mice also have reduced levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), likely derived from macrophages. Reductions in IL-1β transcript levels as well as increased macrophage viability point at differences in cell death pathways. These data identify a novel virulence factor for &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; that influences inflammatory signaling within the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; is a common commensal bacterium that can cause severe infections, such as pneumonia. In the lung, viral infections increase the risk of staphylococcal pneumonia, leading to combined infections known as superinfections. The most common virus associated with &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; pneumonia is influenza, and superinfections lead to worse patient outcomes than either infection alone. While there is much known about how the immune system differs between healthy and virally infected lungs, the role of bacterial virulence factors in single and superinfection is less understood. The significance of our research is identifying bacterial components that play a role in the initiation of lung injury, which could lead to future therapies to prevent pulmonary single or superinfection with &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To explore the roles of macrophages&amp;rsquo; miR-217-5p in the process of PM2.5 induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; GEO database and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis as well as GSEA were used to predicted the miRNA and associated target signals. And then mice and RAW246.7 macrophages treated with PM2.5 to imitate PM2.5 induced acute lung injury environment and then transfected with miR-217-5p NC or miR-217-5p mimic. The levels of inflammatory factors TNF-α and anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 of mice serum were tested by ELISA. And the pathological changes and ROS level of mouse lung tissues were stained by HE and DHE staining. The proteins expression of phosphorylated-STAT1, total-STAT1, TNF-α, IFN-γ as well as p47, gp91, NOX4 in mice or RAW264.7 cells were tested by western blot or immunofluorescence of RAW264.7 cell slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results of bioinformatics analysis indicated the miR-217 as well as STAT1 were involved PM2.5 associated lung injury. After exposure to PM2.5, the decreased levels of serum TNF-α but not IL-10, consistent with reduced macrophages&amp;rsquo; accumulation as well as decreased ROS levels in lung tissues in miR-217-5p mimic group vs miR-217-5p NC group mice, and moreover, the protein expression levels of phosphorylated&amp;ndash;STAT1, total-STAT1, TNF-α, IFN-γ, p47, gp91 and NOX4 in mouse lung tissues and RTAW246.7 macrophages cells were all significantly reduced with miR-217-5p mimic administration. The above phenomena were reversed by specific STAT1-inhibitor HY-N8107.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; miR-217-5p suppressed the activated STAT1-signal induced inflammation and oxidative stress trigged by PM2.5 in macrophages and resulted in the decreased lung injure caused by PM2.5.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicosis is one of the severest occupational diseases worldwide, manifesting as infiltration of inflammatory cells, excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and pulmonary diffuse fibrosis. Macrophages polarization to M2 is one of the major strategies that attenuates inflammatory response. Our previous study found that vitamin D could protect against silica-induced lung injury by damping the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here we further identified that vitamin D attenuated silica particles-induced lung inflammation by regulating macrophage polarization in a KLF4-STAT6 manner. Myeloid-specific Stat6 knockout (cKO) mice were generated for in vivo studies. Primary macrophages purified from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of wildtype or Stat6 cKO mice and differentiated THP-1 cells were used for in vitro studies. Vitamin D was found to promote alveolar macrophage polarizing to M2 phenotype through the STAT6 signaling pathway, as demonstrated by worse lung inflammation and ablated protection of vitamin D in silica particles-instilled Stat6 cKO mice. Mechanismly, vitamin D upregulated KLF4 expression in the alveolar macrophage, which synergistically activated STAT6. Additionally, KLF4 was found to upregulate macrophages autophagy, which protected them from silica particles-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. The protective effects of vitamin D were dismissed by silencing KLF4. Our study demonstrates the potential mechanism of vitamin D-mediated macrophage polarization and reveals the therapeutic application of vitamin D in inflammatory disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence emphasizes the functional impacts of host microbiome on the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, there are limited mechanistic insights into the contribution of microbial biomolecules especially microbial peptides toward modulating immune homeostasis. Here, by mining the metagenomics data of tonsillar microbiome, a deficiency of the encoding genes of lantibiotic peptides salivaricins in RA patients is identified, which shows strong correlation with circulating immune cells. Evidence is provided that the salivaricins exert immunomodulatory effects in inhibiting T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation and interleukin-21 (IL-21) production. Mechanically, salivaricins directly bind to and induce conformational changes of IL-6 and IL-21 receptors, thereby inhibiting the bindings of IL-6 and IL-21 to their receptors and suppressing the downstream signaling pathway. Finally, salivaricin administration exerts both prophylactic and therapeutic effects against experimental arthritis in a murine model of RA. Together, these results provide a mechanism link of microbial peptides-mediated immunomodulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influenza virus causes lung immunopathology through down-regulating PPARγ activity in macrophages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatal influenza (flu) virus infection often activates excessive inflammatory signals, leading to multi-organ failure and death, also referred to as cytokine storm. PPARγ (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonists are well-known candidates for cytokine storm modulation. The present study identified that influenza infection reduced PPARγ expression and decreased PPARγ transcription activity in human alveolar macrophages (AMs) from different donors. Treatment with PPARγ agonist Troglitazone ameliorated virus-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion but did not interfere with the IFN-induced antiviral pathway in human AMs. In contrast, PPARγ antagonist and knockdown of PPARγ in human AMs further enhanced virus-stimulated proinflammatory response. In a mouse model of influenza infection, flu virus dose-dependently reduced PPARγ transcriptional activity and decreased expression of PPARγ. Moreover, PPARγ agonist troglitazone significantly reduced high doses of influenza infection-induced lung pathology. In addition, flu infection reduced PPARγ expression in all mouse macrophages, including AMs, interstitial macrophages, and bone-marrow-derived macrophages but not in alveolar epithelial cells. Our results indicate that the influenza virus specifically targets the PPARγ pathway in macrophages to cause acute injury to the lung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Assessing the Global Impact on the Mouse Kidney After Traumatic Brain Injury: A Transcriptomic Study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36042866/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we use animal models combined with bioinformatics strategies to investigate the potential changes in overall renal transcriptional expression after traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Microarray analysis was performed after kidney acquisition using unilateral controlled cortical impact as the primary mouse TBI model. Multi-oriented gene set enrichment analysis was performed for differentially expressed genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that TBI affected the gene set associated with mitochondria function in kidney cells, and a negative enrichment of gene sets associated with immune cell migration and epidermal development was also observed. Analysis of the disease phenotype gene set revealed that differential expression of mitochondria-related genes was associated with lactate metabolism. Alternatively, activation and adhesion of immune cells associated with the complement system may promote autoinflammation in kidney tissue. The simulated immune cell infiltration analysis showed an increase in the proportion of activated memory CD4 T cells and a decrease in the proportion of resting memory CD4 T cells, suggesting that activated memory CD4 T cell infiltration may be involved in the inflammation of renal tissue and cause damage to renal cells, such as principal cells, mesangial cells and loops of Henle cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study is the first to reveal the effects of brain trauma on the kidney. TBI may affect the expression of mitochondria function-related gene sets in renal cells by increasing lactate. It may also affect renal mesangial cells by inducing increased infiltration of immune cells through mechanisms related to complement system activation or autoimmune antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intermittent fasting attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice by modulating macrophage polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028098/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a spectrum of acute and life-threatening pulmonary inflammatory conditions. Treatment of ALI remains a clinical challenge. Recently, intermittent fasting (IF) has been shown to improve health and alleviate many diseases. In this study, we tested whether IF attenuated ALI and investigated the mechanism underlying this process. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, the effects of IF on ALI were evaluated in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine ALI model. We found that two times of 24-h fasting in a week before ALI efficiently ameliorated LPS-induced lung injury in mice, characterized by alleviated lung lesions, wet-to-dry weight ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde content, and lower levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, functional assays were conducted to assess IF on the inflammatory response and macrophage polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with LPS or IL-4. And PPARγ antagonist GW9662 and AMPK siRNA were used to test the role of PPARγ and AMPK in the IF-mediated improvement of ALI. The results showed that IF (serum deprivation) suppressed macrophage M1 activation and promoted M2 activation in LPS-treated BMDMs. While, IF also augmented macrophage M2 polarization in IL-4-treated BMDMs. Further mechanistic studies showed that the promotive effect of IF on M2 polarization was related to the activation of the PPARγ and AMPK pathways. In conclusion, this study suggests that IF enhances M2 polarization by activating the AMPK and PPARγ pathways, thus facilitating anti-inflammatory response and ameliorating ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long noncoding RNA CHROMR regulates antiviral immunity in humans</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36001732/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effective innate immune response to virus infection requires the induction of type I interferons and up-regulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that instruct antiviral functions and immune regulation. Deciphering the regulatory mechanisms that direct expression of the ISG network is critical for understanding the fundamental organization of the innate immune response and the development of antiviral therapies. We define a regulatory role for the primate-specific long noncoding RNA &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; in coordinating ISG transcription. &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; sequesters the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-2/IRF2BP2 complex that restrains ISG transcription and thus is required to restrict influenza virus replication. These data identify a novel regulator of the antiviral gene program in humans and provide insights into the multilayered regulatory network that controls the innate immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression, yet their contribution to immune regulation in humans remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the primate-specific lncRNA &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; is induced by influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection and coordinates the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that execute antiviral responses. &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; depletion in human macrophages reduces histone acetylation at regulatory regions of ISG loci and attenuates ISG expression in response to microbial stimuli. Mechanistically, we show that &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; sequesters the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-2-dependent transcriptional corepressor IRF2BP2, thereby licensing IRF-dependent signaling and transcription of the ISG network. Consequently, &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; expression is essential to restrict viral infection of macrophages. Our findings identify &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; as a key arbitrator of antiviral innate immune signaling in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obesity reprograms the pulmonary polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived lipidome, transcriptome, and gene-oxylipin networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity exacerbates inflammation upon lung injury; however, the mechanisms by which obesity primes pulmonary dysregulation prior to external injury are not well studied. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that obesity dysregulates pulmonary PUFA metabolism that is central to inflammation initiation and resolution. We first show that a high-fat diet (HFD) administered to C57BL/6J mice increased the relative abundance of pulmonary PUFA-containing triglycerides and the concentration of PUFA-derived oxylipins (particularly prostaglandins and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids), independent of an increase in total pulmonary PUFAs, prior to onset of pulmonary inflammation. Experiments with a genetic model of obesity (ob/ob) generally recapitulated the effects of the HFD on the pulmonary oxylipin signature. Subsequent pulmonary next-generation RNA sequencing identified complex and unique transcriptional regulation with the HFD. We found the HFD increased pathways related to glycerophospholipid metabolism and immunity, including a unique elevation in B cell differentiation and signaling. Furthermore, we conducted computational integration of lipidomic with transcriptomic data. These analyses identified novel HFD-driven networks between glycerophospholipid metabolism and B cell receptor signaling with specific PUFA-derived pulmonary oxylipins. Finally, we confirmed the hypothesis by demonstrating that the concentration of pulmonary oxylipins, in addition to inflammatory markers, were generally increased in mice consuming a HFD upon ozone-induced acute lung injury. Collectively, these data show that a HFD dysregulates pulmonary PUFA metabolism prior to external lung injury, which may be a mechanism by which obesity primes the lungs to respond poorly to infectious and/or inflammatory challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pyrogallol enhances therapeutic effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells against LPS-mediated inflammation and lung injury via activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028178/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenges in clinical applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attributed to their heterogeneity. It is believed that preconditioning of MSCs with active compounds may enhance the expression of potentially therapeutic molecules and thus achieve stable and effective therapeutic outcomes. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which pyrogallol increased the therapeutic efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) against LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI). hUCMSCs with pyrogallol treatment increased expression of HO-1 at both mRNA and protein levels, accompanied by Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1 (Keap1) degradation, and upregulation of the Nrf2 protein levels as well as nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Moreover, the modulation of Keap1 and Nrf2 as well as HO-1 upregulation by pyrogallol was reversed by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and a P38 kinase inhibitor (SB203580). Whereas, NAC pretreatment abrogated pyrogallol-mediated activation of P38 kinase, indicating that pyrogallol-derived ROS led to P38 kinase activation, thus promoting Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Additionally, we found that the induction of p62 by the pyrogallol-mediated ROS/P38/Nrf2 axis interacted with Keap1 and resulted in autophagic degradation of Keap1, which created a positive feedback loop to further release of Nrf2. Furthermore, the increased expression of HO-1 in pyrogallol-pretreated hUCMSCs led to enhanced inhibitory effects on LPS-mediated TLR4/P-P65 signaling in BEAS-2B cells, resulting in increasing suppression of LPS-indued expression of a series of pro-inflammatory mediators. Compared to untreated hUCMSCs, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with pyrogallol-primed hUCMSCs transplantation showed enhanced improvements in LPS-mediated lung pathological alterations, the increased lung index (lung/body ratio), apoptosis of epithelial cells, the activation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling as well as the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Together, these results suggested that hUCMSCs with pyrogallol pretreatment enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSCs, which may provide a promising therapeutic strategy to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSC-based therapy for treating LPS-associated ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhabdomyolysis induced acute kidney injury (RIAKI) is a life-threatening condition responsible for approximately 19-58% of AKI cases worldwide. We performed an intramuscular injection of glycerol (10 mL/kg) in male wistar rats to induce AKI. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was administered for 3 consecutive days to evaluate its protective effects. We observed significant downregulation in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and LDH at different time points on EGCG treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, H&amp;amp;E staining also revealed that EGCG was able to reduce the formation of damaged tubules and tubular necrosis which was prominently spread throughout the kidney tissue of glycerol treatment group. Concomitantly, we observed upregulated inflammation, ER stress and elevated oxidative stress in the glycerol treated group only, which was significantly normalized upon EGCG treatment in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The occurrence of apoptosis in kidney tubules was found to be relatively higher in glycerol treated group and H2O2 treated HEK-293 cells. The results obtained after EGCG treatment revealed a significant decrease in apoptotic cell population, which was further validated by immunofluorescence staining against p53 and comet assay in HEK-293 cells and p53 IHC in kidney tissues. Western blotting also revealed a systemic downregulation of intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway markers such as bax, bcl-2, pro and cleaved caspase 3, caspase 9 and PARP1. Additionally, the results for flow cytometry analysis and TUNEL assay corroborated apoptotic equilibrium. Conclusively, we reckon EGCG as a multi-therapeutic natural product that can be used the for treatment of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synergistic effect of low-frequency ultrasound and antibiotics on the treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antibiotic-resistant &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; (Kp) has become a significant crisis in treating pneumonia. Low-frequency ultrasound (LFU) is promising to overcome the obstacles. Mice were infected with bioluminescent Kp Xen39 by intratracheal injection to study the therapeutic effect of LFU in combination with antibiotics. The counts per second (CPS) were assessed with an animal biophoton imaging system. Bacterial clearance, histopathology, and the concentrations of cytokines were determined to evaluate the therapeutic effect. LC-MS/MS was used to detect the distribution of antibiotics in the lung and plasma. LFU in combination with meropenem (MEM) or amikacin (AMK) significantly improved the behavioural state of mice. The CPS of the LFU combination group were more significantly decreased compared with those of the antibiotic alone groups. The average colony-forming units of lung tissue in the LFU combination groups were also lower than those of the antibiotic groups. Although no significant changes of cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were observed, LFU in combination with antibiotics showed less inflammatory damage from histopathological results compared with the antibiotic-alone groups. Moreover, 10 min of LFU treatment promoted the distribution of MEM and AMK in mouse lung tissue at 60 and 30 min, respectively, after dosage. LFU could enhance the effectiveness of MEM and AMK in the treatment of Kp-induced pneumonia, which might be attributed to the fact that LFU could promote the distribution of antibiotics in lung tissue and reduce inflammatory injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Wear particles-induced osteolysis is a major long-term complication after total joint arthroplasty. Up to now, there is no effective treatment for wear particles-induced osteolysis except for the revision surgery, which is a heavy psychological and economic burden to patients. A metabolite of gut microbiota, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), has been reported to be beneficial for many chronic inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of SCFAs on osteolysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A model of inflammatory osteolysis was established by applying CoCrMo alloy particles to mouse calvarium. After two weeks of intervention, the anti-inflammatory effects of SCFAs on wear particle-induced osteolysis were evaluated by Micro-CT analysis and immunohistochemistry staining. In vitro study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) primed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and Tohoku Hospital Pediatrics-1 (THP-1) macrophages were stimulated with CoCrMo particles to activate inflammasome in the presence of acetate (C2), propionate (C3), and butyrate (C4). Western blotting, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunofluorescence were used to detect the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The effects of SCFAs on osteoclasts were evaluate by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Additionally, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, agonists of GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A were applied to confirm the underlying mechanism of SCFAs on the inflammasome activation of macrophages and osteoclastogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; C3 and C4 but not C2 could alleviate wear particles-induced osteolysis with fewer bone erosion pits (P &amp;lt; 0.001), higher level of bone volume to tissue volume (BV/TV, P &amp;lt; 0.001), bone mineral density (BMD, P &amp;lt; 0.001), and a lower total porosity (P &amp;lt; 0.001). C3 and C4 prevented CoCrMo alloy particles-induced ASC speck formation and nucleation-induced oligomerization, suppressing the cleavage of caspase-1 (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and IL-1β (P &amp;lt; 0.05) stimulated by CoCrMo alloy particles. C3 and C4 also inhibited the generation of Gasdermin D-N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) to regulate pyroptosis. Besides, C3 and C4 have a negative impact on osteoclast differentiation (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and its function (P &amp;lt; 0.05), affecting the podosome arrangement and morphologically normal podosome belts formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our work showed that C3 and C4 are qualified candidates for the treatment of wear particle-induced osteolysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>scRNA-seq of gastric tumor shows complex intercellular interaction with an alternative T cell exhaustion trajectory</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35999201/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumor microenvironment (TME) in gastric cancer (GC) has been shown to be important for tumor control but the specific characteristics for GC are not fully appreciated. We generated an atlas of 166,533 cells from 10 GC patients with matched paratumor tissues and blood. Our results show tumor-associated stromal cells (TASCs) have upregulated activity of Wnt signaling and angiogenesis, and are negatively correlated with survival. Tumor-associated macrophages and LAMP3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs are involved in mediating T cell activity and form intercellular interaction hubs with TASCs. Clonotype and trajectory analysis demonstrates that Tc17 (IL-17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells) originate from tissue-resident memory T cells and can subsequently differentiate into exhausted T cells, suggesting an alternative pathway for T cell exhaustion. Our results indicate that IL17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells may promote tumor progression through IL17, IL22, and IL26 signaling, highlighting the possibility of targeting IL17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and associated signaling pathways as a therapeutic strategy to treat GC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Increased expression and accumulation of GDF15 in IPF extracellular matrix contribute to fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35993367/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease of unmet medical need. It is characterized by formation of scar tissue leading to a progressive and irreversible decline in lung function. IPF is associated with repeated injury, which may alter the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we demonstrate that IPF patient-derived pulmonary ECM drives profibrotic response in normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) in a 3D spheroid assay. Next, we reveal distinct alterations in composition of the diseased ECM, identifying potentially novel associations with IPF. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) was identified among the most significantly upregulated proteins in the IPF lung-derived ECM. In vivo, GDF15 neutralization in a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model led to significantly less fibrosis. In vitro, recombinant GDF15 (rGDF15) stimulated α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression in NHLF, and this was mediated by the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) receptor. Furthermore, in the presence of rGDF15, the migration of NHLF in collagen gel was reduced. In addition, we observed a cell type-dependent effect of GDF15 on the expression of cell senescence markers. Our data suggest that GDF15 mediates lung fibrosis through fibroblast activation and differentiation, implicating a potential direct role of this matrix-associated cytokine in promoting aberrant cell responses in disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antioxidant mitoquinone ameliorates EtOH-LPS induced lung injury by inhibiting mitophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36059543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic ethanol abuse is a systemic disorder and a risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. One explanation is that ethanol produces damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disturbs the balance of mitochondria within the lungs to promote a pro-injury environment. We hypothesized that targeting an antioxidant to the mitochondria would prevent oxidative damage and attenuate EtOH-LPS-induced lung injury. To test this, we investigated the effects of mitochondria-targeted ubiquinone, Mitoquinone (MitoQ) on ethanol-sensitized lung injury induced by LPS. Lung inflammation, ROS, mitochondria function, and mitophagy were assessed. We demonstrated that chronic ethanol feeding sensitized the lung to LPS-induced lung injury with significantly increased reactive oxygen species ROS level and mitochondrial injury as well as lung cellular NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These deleterious effects were attenuated by MitoQ administration in mice. The protective effects of MitoQ are associated with decreased cellular mitophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Taken together, our results demonstrated that ethanol aggravated LPS-induced lung injury, and antioxidant MitoQ protects from EtOH-LPS-induced lung injury, probably through reducing mitophagy and protecting mitochondria, followed by NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results will provide the prevention and treatment of ethanol intake effects with new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oxypeucedanin relieves LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the inflammation and maintaining the integrity of the lung air-blood barrier</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35985771/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is commonly accompanied by a severe inflammatory reaction process, and effectively managing inflammatory reactions is an important therapeutic approach for alleviating ALI. Macrophages play an important role in the inflammatory response, and this role is proinflammatory in the early stages of inflammation and anti-inflammatory in the late stages. Oxypeucedanin is a natural product with a wide range of pharmacological functions. This study aimed to determine the effect of oxypeucedanin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the following experiments were performed based on LPS-induced models &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Using myeloperoxidase activity measurement, ELISA, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting, we found that oxypeucedanin modulated the activity of myeloperoxidase and decreased the expression levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, MPO, COX-2 and iNOS in LPS-induced inflammation models. Meanwhile, oxypeucedanin inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT and its downstream NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, oxypeucedanin significantly decreased the pulmonary vascular permeability, which was induced by LPSs, and the enhanced expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin and Claudin 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of oxypeucedanin is associated with the inhibition of the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways and the maintenance of the integrity of the lung air-blood barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Progress in preclinical studies of macrophage autophagy in the regulation of ALI/ARDS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that poses a major challenge in critical care medicine. The development of ALI/ARDS involves excessive inflammatory response, and macrophage autophagy plays an important role in regulating the inflammatory response in ALI/ARDS. In this paper, we review the effects of autophagy in regulating macrophage function, discuss the roles of macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS, and highlight drugs and other interventions that can modulate macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS to improve the understanding of the mechanism of macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS and provide new ideas and further research directions for the treatment of ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Puerarin ameliorates acute lung injury by modulating NLRP3 inflammasome-induced pyroptosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We commenced to analyze putative anti-pyroptosis effects of puerarin (PU) as mediated by the PP2A-HDAC1-NLRP3 pathway in acute lung injury (ALI). ALI animal and cell models were constructed, followed by treatment of PU. Then, the effect of HDAC1, PP2A, and NLRP3 on cell inflammation and pyroptosis was explored. The interaction between HDAC1 and PP2A as well as between PP2A and NLRP3 was analyzed. Our findings suggested that PU downregulated HDAC1 expression to alleviate symptoms of ALI. HDAC1 overexpression promoted inflammation induced by LPS, which reversed the inhibitory effect of PU on ALI. HDAC1 overexpression also decreased PP2A expression, suggesting that PP2A was involved in the effects of HDAC1 on LPS-induced inflammation. PP2A exerted inhibitory effects on NLRP3. Meanwhile, PU hindered the progression of ALI by silencing HDAC1 or overexpressing PP2A both in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, PU restrained pyroptosis of cells induced by NLRP3 inflammasome to abate ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling in perivascular cells enhances inflammation and fibrosis in the kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35976996/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by sustained inflammation and progressive fibrosis, is highly prevalent and can eventually progress to end-stage kidney disease. However, current treatments to slow CKD progression are limited. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a product of sphingolipid catabolism, is a pleiotropic mediator involved in many cellular functions, and drugs targeting S1P signaling have previously been studied particularly for autoimmune diseases. The primary mechanism of most of these drugs is functional antagonism of S1P receptor-1 (S1P1) expressed on lymphocytes and the resultant immunosuppressive effect. Here, we documented the role of local S1P signaling in perivascular cells in the progression of kidney fibrosis using primary kidney perivascular cells and several conditional mouse models. S1P was predominantly produced by sphingosine kinase 2 in kidney perivascular cells and exported via spinster homolog 2 (Spns2). It bound to S1P1 expressed in perivascular cells to enhance production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines upon injury, leading to immune cell infiltration and subsequent fibrosis. A small-molecule Spns2 inhibitor blocked S1P transport, resulting in suppression of inflammatory signaling in human and mouse kidney perivascular cells in vitro and amelioration of kidney fibrosis in mice. Our study provides insight into the regulation of inflammation and fibrosis by S1P and demonstrates the potential of Spns2 inhibition as a treatment for CKD and potentially other inflammatory and fibrotic diseases that avoids the adverse events associated with systemic modulation of S1P receptors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protection against influenza-induced Acute Lung Injury (ALI) by enhanced induction of M2a macrophages: possible role of PPARγ/RXR ligands in IL-4-induced M2a macrophage differentiation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36052067/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many respiratory viruses cause lung damage that may evolve into acute lung injury (ALI), a cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and ultimately, death. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) family of transcription factors, regulates transcription by forming heterodimers with another NHR family member, Retinoid X Receptor (RXR). Each component of the heterodimer binds specific ligands that modify transcriptional capacity of the entire heterodimer by recruiting different co-activators/co-repressors. However, the role of PPARγ/RXR ligands in the context of influenza infection is not well understood. PPARγ is associated with macrophage differentiation to an anti-inflammatory M2 state. We show that mice lacking the IL-4Rα receptor, required for M2a macrophage differentiation, are more susceptible to mouse-adapted influenza (A/PR/8/34; &amp;ldquo;PR8&amp;rdquo;)-induced lethality. Mice lacking &lt;em&gt;Ptgs2&lt;/em&gt;, that encodes COX-2, a key proinflammatory M1 macrophage mediator, are more resistant. Blocking the receptor for COX-2-induced Prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was also protective. Treatment with pioglitazone (PGZ), a PPARγ ligand, increased survival from PR8 infection, decreased M1 macrophage gene expression, and increased PPARγ mRNA in lungs. Conversely, conditional knockout mice expressing PPARγ-deficient macrophages were significantly more sensitive to PR8-induced lethality. These findings were extended in cotton rats: PGZ blunted lung inflammation and M1 cytokine gene expression after challenge with non-adapted human influenza. To study mechanisms by which PPARγ/RXR transcription factors induce canonical M2a genes, WT mouse macrophages were treated with IL-4 in the absence or presence of rosiglitazone (RGZ; PPARγ ligand), LG100754 (LG; RXR ligand), or both. IL-4 dose-dependently induced M2a genes &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chil3&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Retnla&lt;/em&gt;. Treatment of macrophages with IL-4 and RGZ and/or LG differentially affected induction of &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;Chil3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Retnla&lt;/em&gt; gene expression. In PPARγ-deficient macrophages, IL-4 alone failed to induce &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; gene expression; however, concurrent treatment with LG or RGZ + LG enhanced IL-4-induced &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; expression, but to a lower level than in WT macrophages, findings confirmed in the murine alveolar macrophage cell line, MH-S. These findings support a model in which PPARγ/RXR heterodimers control IL-4-induced M2a differentiation, and suggest that PPARγ/RXR agonists should be considered as important tools for clinical intervention against influenza-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcription-independent regulation of STING activation and innate immune responses by IRF8 in monocytes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35973990/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensing of cytosolic DNA of microbial or cellular/mitochondrial origin by cGAS initiates innate immune responses via the adaptor protein STING. It remains unresolved how the activity of STING is balanced between a productive innate immune response and induction of autoimmunity. Here we show that interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is essential for efficient activation of STING-mediated innate immune responses in monocytes. This function of IRF8 is independent of its transcriptional role in monocyte differentiation. In uninfected cells, IRF8 remains inactive via sequestration of its IRF-associated domain by its N- and C-terminal tails, which reduces its association with STING. Upon triggering the DNA sensing pathway, IRF8 is phosphorylated at Serine 151 to allow its association with STING via the IRF-associated domain. This is essential for STING polymerization and TBK1-mediated STING and IRF3 phosphorylation. Consistently, IRF8-deficiency impairs host defense against the DNA virus HSV-1, and blocks DNA damage-induced cellular senescence. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells which have an autoimmune phenotype due to deficiency of Trex1, respond to IRF-8 deletion with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients are characterized by elevated phosphorylation of IRF8 at the same Serine residue we find to be important in STING activation, and in these cells STING is hyper-active. Taken together, the transcription-independent function of IRF8 we describe here appears to mediate STING activation and represents an important regulatory step in the cGAS/STING innate immune pathway in monocytes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanisms of pulmonary endothelial permeability and inflammation caused by extracellular histone subunits H3 and H4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular DNA-binding proteins such as histones are danger-associated molecular pattern released by the injured tissues in trauma and sepsis settings, which trigger host immune response and vascular dysfunction. Molecular events leading to histone-induced endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction remain poorly understood. This study performed comparative analysis of H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histone subunits effects on human pulmonary EC permeability and inflammatory response. Analysis of transendothelial electrical resistance and EC monolayer permeability for macromolecues revealed that H3 and H4, but not H1, H2A, or H2B caused dose-dependent EC permeability accompanied by disassembly of adherens junctions. At higher doses, H3 and H4 activated nuclear factor kappa B inflammatory cascade leading to upregulation EC adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1, E-selectin, and release of inflammatory cytokines. Inhibitory receptor analysis showed that toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 but not TLR1/2 or receptor for advanced glycation end inhibition significantly attenuated deleterious effects of H3 and H4 histones. Inhibitor of Rho-kinase was without effect, while inhibition of Src kinase caused partial preservation of cell-cell junctions, H3/H4-induced permeability and inflammation. Deleterious effects of H3/H4 were blocked by heparin. Activation of Epac-Rap1 signaling restored EC barrier properties after histone challenge. Intravenous injection of histones in mice caused elevation of inflammatory markers and increased vascular leak. Post-treatment with pharmacological Epac/Rap1 activator suppressed injurious effects of histones in vitro and in vivo. These results identify H3 and H4 as key histone subunits exhibiting deleterious effects on pulmonary vascular endothelium via TLR4-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, elevation of circulating histones may represent a serious risk of exacerbated acute lung injury (ALI) and multiple organ injury during severe trauma and infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-192-5p/RB1/NF-κBp65 signaling axis promotes IL-10 secretion during gastric cancer EMT to induce Treg cell differentiation in the tumour microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35969010/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35969010/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Regulatory T (Treg) cells are important components of the tumour microenvironment (TME) that play roles in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. Although tumour cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulate Treg cell function, their regulatory mechanism in GC remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The miR-192-5p was identified by examining three Gene Expression Omnibus GC miRNA expression datasets. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted to identify interactions between miR-192-5p and RB1. The role of miR-192-5p/RB1 in GC progression was evaluated based on EdU incorporation, wound healing and Transwell assays. An in vitro co-culture assay was performed to measure the effect of miR-192-5p/RB1 on Treg cell differentiation. In vivo experiments were conducted to explore the role of miR-192-5p in GC progression and Treg cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MiR-192-5p was overexpressed in tumour and was associated with poor prognosis in GC. MiR-192-5p bound to the RB1 3&amp;rsquo;-untranslated region, resulting in GC EMT, proliferation, migration and invasion. MiR-192-5p/RB1 mediated interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion by regulating nuclear factor-kappaBp65 (NF-κBp65), affecting Treg cell differentiation. NF-κBp65, in turn, promoted miR-192-5p expression and formed a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that miR-192-5p/RB1 promotes GC growth and Treg cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, our studies indicate that miR-192-5p/RB1 promotes EMT of tumour cells, and the miR-192-5p/RB1/NF-κBp65 signaling axis induces Treg cell differentiation by regulating IL-10 secretion in GC. Our results suggest that targeting miR-192-5p/RB1/NF-κBp65 /IL-10 may pave the way for the development of new immune treatments for GC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CuO-NPs-triggered heterophil extracellular traps exacerbate liver injury in chicks by promoting oxidative stress and inflammatory responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35962800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the widespread use of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NPs), their potential toxicity to the environment and biological health has attracted close attention. Heterophil extracellular traps (HETs) are an innate immune mechanism of chicken heterophils against adverse stimuli, but excessive HETs cause damage. Here, we explored the effect and mechanism of CuO-NPs on HETs formation in vitro and further evaluated the potential role of HETs in chicken liver and kidney injury. Heterophils were exposed to 5, 10, and 20 µg/mL of CuO-NPs for 2 h. The results showed that CuO-NPs induced typical HETs formation, which was dependent on NADPH oxidase, P38 and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) pathways, and glycolysis. In in vivo experiments, fluorescence microplate and morphological analysis showed that CuO-NPs elevated the level of HETs in chicken serum and caused liver and kidney damage. Meanwhile, CuO-NPs caused hepatic oxidative stress (MDA, SOD, CAT, and GSH-PX imbalance), and also induced an increase in mRNA expression of their inflammatory and apoptosis-related factors (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, COX-2, iNOS, NLRP3, and Caspase-1, 3, 11). However, these results were significantly altered by DNase I (HETs degradation reagent). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that CuO-NPs induce the formation of HETs and that HETs exacerbate pathological damage in chicken liver and kidney by promoting oxidative stress and inflammation, providing insights into immunotoxicity and potential prevention and treatment targets caused by CuO-NPs overexposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macrophage SAMSN1 protects against sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35981417/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the progression of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). SAM domain, SH3 domain and nuclear localization signals 1 (SAMSN1) is a signaling adaptor protein, and mainly regulates inflammatory response of various immune cells. The present study generates macrophage-specific SAMSN1-knockout (Samsn1MKO) and SAMSN1-transgenic (Samsn1MTG) mice to investigate its role and mechanism in sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Samsn1&lt;sup&gt;MKO&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Samsn1&lt;sup&gt;MTG&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instillation or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery to induce sepsis-induced ALI. Bone marrow transplantation, cellular depletion and non-invasive adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were performed to validate the role of macrophage SAMSN1 in sepsis-induced ALI in vivo. Meanwhile, BMDMs were isolated from Samsn1MKO or Samsn1MTG mice to further clarify the role of SAMSN1 in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Macrophage SAMSN1 expression was increased in response to LPS stimulation, and negatively correlated with LPS-induced ALI in mice. Macrophage SAMSN1 deficiency exacerbated, while macrophage SAMSN1 overexpression ameliorated LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and ALI in mice and in BMDMs. Mechanistically, we found that macrophage SAMSN1 overexpression prevented LPS-induced ALI though activating AMP-activated protein kinase α2 (AMPKα2) &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Further studies revealed that SAMSN1 directly bound to growth factor receptor bound protein 2-associated protein 1 (GAB1) to prevent its protein degradation, and subsequently enhanced protein kinase A (PKA)/AMPKα2 activation in a protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11, also known as SHP2)-dependent manner. Moreover, we observed that macrophage SAMSN1 overexpression diminished CLP-induced ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study documents the protective role of macrophage SAMSN1 against sepsis-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and ALI through activating AMPKα2 in a GAB1/SHP2/PKA pathway, and defines it as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target to treat sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Role of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Early Microthrombosis and Brain Injury After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35962915/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microthrombosis plays an important role in secondary brain injury after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but the specific mechanism of microthrombosis remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in microthrombosis after SAH. SAH was induced in male C57BL/6 mice using an endovascular perforation technique. The marker protein of NETs, citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), was significantly elevated in the cerebral cortex after SAH, and was co-labeled with microthrombi. Both depletion of neutrophils by anti-Ly6G antibody and DNase I treatment significantly reduced the formation of NETs and microthrombi, and ameliorated neurological deficits, brain edema, BBB disruption, and neuronal injury at 24 h after SAH induction. Cerebral hypoperfusion in the first hours after SAH is a major determinant of poor neurological outcome; in this study, we found that DNase I treatment significantly improved the restoration of early cortical perfusion after SAH. In addition, DNase I treatment also significantly attenuated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow after SAH, which was associated with the diffusion barrier caused by microthrombi in the paravascular space after SAH. In conclusion, NETs are associated with early microthrombosis after SAH; they may be a novel therapeutic target for early brain injury (EBI) after SAH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zanubrutinib ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via regulating macrophage polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35973369/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zanubrutinib could relieve LPS induced lung injuries in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway is involved in Zanubrutinib -mediated M1 macrophage polarization in RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zanubrutinib promotes M2 macrophage activation through regulating JAK/STAT6 and PI3K/AKT pathway in RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a disease characterized by pulmonary diffusion dysfunction and its exacerbation stage is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may develop to multiple organ failure and seriously threatens human health. ALI has high mortality rates and few effective treatments, thus effective protection measures for ALI are becoming increasingly important. Macrophages play a key regulatory role in the pathogenesis of ALI, and the degree of macrophage polarization is closely related to the severity and prognosis of ALI. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Zanubrutinib (ZB), a BTK small molecule inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of cell lymphoma, on macrophage polarization and acute lung injury. In the in vivo study, we constructed a mouse model of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury and found that ZB could improve the acute injury of mouse lungs by inhibiting the secretion of proinflammatory factors and promoting the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, reduce the number of inflammatory cells in alveolar lavage fluid, and then alleviate the inflammatory response. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that ZB could inhibit the M1 macrophage polarization and promote the M2 macrophage polarization. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that ZB could inhibit the macrophage M1 polarization via targeting BTK activation and inhibiting JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways, and promote the macrophage M2 polarization by promoting the activation of STAT6 and PI3K / Akt signaling pathways. In summary, ZB has shown therapeutic effect in LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, which provides a potential candidate drug to treat acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular histones aggravate autoimmune arthritis by lytic cell death</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36032105/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36032105/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although recent studies have demonstrated a proinflammatory effect of extracellular histones in sepsis via endothelial cytotoxicity, little is known about their contribution to autoimmune arthritis. Therefore, we investigated the role of extracellular histones in autoimmune arthritis and their cytotoxic effect on synoviocytes and macrophages. We measured histones in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and evaluated arthritis severity in a serum-transfer arthritis (STA) mouse model with intraperitoneal histone injection. Histone-induced cytotoxicity was measured using SYTOX green staining in the synoviocyte cell line MH7A and macrophages differentiated from the monocytic cell line THP-1, and the production of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) was measured by HMGB1 and ATP. Furthermore, we performed RNA-seq analysis of THP-1 cells stimulated with H2B-α1 peptide or with its citrullinated form. The levels of histones were elevated in RA synovial fluid, and histones aggravated arthritis in the STA model. Histones induced cytotoxicity and DAMP production in synoviocytes and macrophages. Chondroitin sulfate reduced histone-induced cytotoxicity, while lipopolysaccharides aggravated cytotoxicity. Moreover, the cytotoxicity decreased when the arginines in H2B-α1 were replaced with citrullines, which demonstrated its electrostatic nature. In transcriptome analysis, H2B-α1 changed the gene expression pattern of THP-1 cells involving chemokines, interleukin-1, -4, -10, -13, and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. Extracellular histones were increased in RA synovial fluid and aggravated synovitis in STA. They induced lytic cell death through electrostatic interaction with synoviocytes and macrophages, leading to the secretion of DAMPs. These findings suggest that histones play a central role in autoimmune arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autoinducer-2 promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36033859/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that causes various acute and chronic lung infections in immunocompromised patients. We previously found that a quorum sensing (QS) signal, namely, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), facilitates the pathogenicity of the wild-type (WT) &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 strain &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. However, the immunological mechanism that leads to pulmonary injury remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of AI-2 on interleukin-17A (IL-17A) production during acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 lung infection using a mouse model, with an emphasis on the underlying immunological mechanism. Compared to infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 alone, infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 combined with AI-2 treatment resulted in significantly increased levels of IL-17A, numbers of Th17 cells and levels of STAT3 in the lung tissues of WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), as well as more serious lung damage. In contrast, the concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and the chemokine keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) were significantly reduced during &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infection in IL-17A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and no effects were observed after AI-2 treatment (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the level of IL-17A in the lungs of WT mice was significantly reduced following infection with a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; strain harboring mutations in the QS genes &lt;em&gt;lasR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rhlR&lt;/em&gt; compared with the level of IL-17A following infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1. Our data suggest that AI-2 promotes &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway by interfering with the QS systems of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. IL-17A may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infections in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; A better understanding of the mechanism of action of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) is needed to support their use as novel therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Macrophages are important mediators of ARDS inflammatory response. Suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins are key regulators of the macrophage phenotype switch. We therefore investigated whether SOCS proteins are involved in mediation of the MSC effect on human macrophage reprogramming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or plasma samples from patients with ARDS (these samples were previously classified into hypo-inflammatory and hyper-inflammatory phenotype) and treated with MSC conditioned medium (CM) or EVs. Protein expression was measured by Western blot. EV micro RNA (miRNA) content was determined by miRNA sequencing. In vivo: LPS-injured C57BL/6 mice were given EVs isolated from MSCs in which miR-181a had been silenced by miRNA inhibitor or overexpressed using miRNA mimic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; EVs were the key component of MSC CM responsible for anti-inflammatory modulation of human macrophages. EVs significantly reduced secretion of tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-8 by LPS-stimulated or ARDS plasma-stimulated MDMs and this was dependent on SOCS1. Transfer of miR-181a in EVs downregulated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and subsequently activated phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5) leading to upregulation of SOCS1 in macrophages. In vivo, EVs alleviated lung injury and upregulated pSTAT5 and SOCS1 expression in alveolar macrophages in a miR181-dependent manner. Overexpression of miR-181a in MSCs significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy of EVs in this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; miR-181a-PTEN-pSTAT5-SOCS1 axis is a novel pathway responsible for immunomodulatory effect of MSC EVs in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oridonin attenuates lung inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis via covalent targeting iNOS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oridonin alleviates the progression of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oridonin inhibits silica-induced alveolar macrophage injury and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oridonin covalently targets iNOS and inhibits its level and activity, thereby providing a new potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of silicosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicosis, the most common type of pneumoconiosis, exhibits a high incidence in workers who are chronically exposed to crystalline silica (CS). No specific remedy for cure as yet. The terpenoid oridonin exerts multiple modulatory functions in neoplasms and inflammations as a natural compound. In this study, we explored the effect of oridonin on silicosis and revealed the underlying molecular mechanism. An experimental silicosis mouse model was established to evaluate the effects of oridonin on pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, the impact of oridonin on alveolar macrophages (AMs) was examined in the MH-S cell line. Its molecular target, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), was identified by chemobiological means, and virus-mediated gene overexpression systems confirmed that oridonin directly restrained iNOS protein levels. Oridonin alleviated pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis in silicosis mice with no obvious systemic toxicity. These effects were partially related to oridonin inhibition of CS-induced AMs injury and inflammation. Furthermore, oridonin suppressed iNOS enzymatic expression and activity by covalently binding to the Thr109 residue of the iNOS target. Thus, our results indicate oridonin as a potential iNOS enzymatic suppressor in experimental silicosis that attenuates pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis progression, which provides a therapeutic avenue for silicosis prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The retroelement Lx9 puts a brake on the immune response to virus infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that mobile units of nucleic acid known as transposable elements can operate as genomic controlling elements was put forward over six decades ago. However, it was not until the advancement of genomic sequencing technologies that the abundance and repertoire of transposable elements were revealed, and they are now known to constitute up to two-thirds of mammalian genomes. The presence of DNA regulatory regions including promoters, enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites within transposable elements has led to the hypothesis that transposable elements have been co-opted to regulate mammalian gene expression and cell phenotype. Mammalian transposable elements include recent acquisitions and ancient transposable elements that have been maintained in the genome over evolutionary time. The presence of ancient conserved transposable elements correlates positively with the likelihood of a regulatory function, but functional validation remains an essential step to identify transposable element insertions that have a positive effect on fitness. Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of a transposable element-namely the LINE-1 retrotransposon Lx9c11-in mice results in an exaggerated and lethal immune response to virus infection. Lx9c11 is critical for the neogenesis of a non-coding RNA (Lx9c11-RegoS) that regulates genes of the Schlafen family, reduces the hyperinflammatory phenotype and rescues lethality in virus-infected Lx9c11-/- mice. These findings provide evidence that a transposable element can control the immune system to favour host survival during virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Erythropoietin mediates re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages through PI3K/AKT signaling and protects mice against secondary infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016936/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure leads to a hypo-responsive state by macrophages to a secondary stimulation of LPS, known as endotoxin tolerance. However, recent findings show that functions of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages are not completely suppressed, whereas they undergo a functional re-programming process with upregulation of a panel of molecules leading to enhanced protective functions including antimicrobial and tissue-remodeling activities. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), exerts anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective activities. Nevertheless, the potential effects of EPO on functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages have not been investigated yet. Here, we found that initial LPS exposure led to upregulation of HIF-1α/EPO in macrophages and that EPO enhanced tolerance in tolerized macrophages and mice as demonstrated by suppressed proinflammatory genes such as &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; after secondary LPS stimulation. Moreover, we showed that EPO improved host protective genes in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages and mice, such as the anti-bacterial genes coding for cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (&lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;) and macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (&lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;), and the tissue-repairing gene vascular endothelial growth factor C (&lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;). Therefore, our findings indicate that EPO mediates the functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages. Mechanistically, we found that PI3K/AKT signaling contributed to EPO-mediated re-programming through upregulation of &lt;em&gt;Irak3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wdr5&lt;/em&gt; expression. Specifically, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK3) was responsible for inhibiting proinflammatory genes &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; in tolerized macrophages after LPS rechallenge, whereas WDR5 contributed to the upregulation of host beneficial genes including &lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;. In a septic model of mice, EPO pretreatment significantly promoted endotoxin-tolerant re-programming, alleviated lung injury, enhanced bacterial clearance, and decreased mortality in LPS-tolerized mice after secondary infection of &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;. Collectively, our results reveal a novel role for EPO in mediating functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages; thus, targeting EPO appears to be a new therapeutic option in sepsis and other inflammatory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD-L1 maintains neutrophil extracellular traps release by inhibiting neutrophil autophagy in endotoxin-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016930/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is not only an important molecule in mediating tumor immune escape, but also regulates inflammation development. Here we showed that PD-L1 was upregulated on neutrophils in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Neutrophil specific knockout of PD-L1 reduced lung injury in ARDS model induced by intratracheal LPS injection. The level of NET release was reduced and autophagy is elevated by PD-L1 knockout in ARDS neutrophils both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Inhibition of autophagy could reverse the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 knockout on NET release. PD-L1 interacted with p85 subunit of PI3K at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in neutrophils from ARDS patients, activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. An extrinsic neutralizing antibody against PD-L1 showed a protective effect against ARDS. Together, PD-L1 maintains the release of NETs by regulating autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in ARDS. Anti-PD-L1 therapy may be a promising measure in treating ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Balanced control of thermogenesis by nuclear receptor corepressors in brown adipose tissue</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35939699/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a key thermogenic organ whose expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and ability to maintain body temperature in response to acute cold exposure require histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). HDAC3 exists in tight association with nuclear receptor corepressors (NCoRs) NCoR1 and NCoR2 (also known as silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors [SMRT]), but the functions of NCoR1/2 in BAT have not been established. Here we report that as expected, genetic loss of NCoR1/2 in BAT (NCoR1/2 BAT-dKO) leads to loss of HDAC3 activity. In addition, HDAC3 is no longer bound at its physiological genomic sites in the absence of NCoR1/2, leading to a shared deregulation of BAT lipid metabolism between NCoR1/2 BAT-dKO and HDAC3 BAT-KO mice. Despite these commonalities, loss of NCoR1/2 in BAT does not phenocopy the cold sensitivity observed in HDAC3 BAT-KO, nor does loss of either corepressor alone. Instead, BAT lacking NCoR1/2 is inflamed, particularly with respect to the interleukin-17 axis that increases thermogenic capacity by enhancing innervation. Integration of BAT RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data revealed that NCoR1/2 directly regulate Mmp9, which integrates extracellular matrix remodeling and inflammation. These findings reveal pleiotropic functions of the NCoR/HDAC3 corepressor complex in BAT, such that HDAC3-independent suppression of BAT inflammation counterbalances stimulation of HDAC3 activity in the control of thermogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Galectin-3 inhibitor GB0139 protects against acute lung injury by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment and activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36003515/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Galectin-3 (Gal-3) drives fibrosis during chronic lung injury, however, its role in acute lung injury (ALI) remains unknown. Effective pharmacological therapies available for ALI are limited; identifying novel concepts in treatment is essential. GB0139 is a Gal-3 inhibitor currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We investigate the role of Gal-3 in ALI and evaluate whether its inhibition with GB0139 offers a protective role. The effect of GB0139 on ALI was explored &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The pharmacokinetic profile of intra-tracheal (i.t.) GB0139 was investigated in C57BL/6 mice to support the daily dosing regimen. GB0139 (1-30 µg) was then assessed following acute i.t. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bleomycin administration. Histology, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALf) analysis, and flow cytometric analysis of lung digests and BALf were performed. The impact of GB0139 on cell activation and apoptosis was determined &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; using neutrophils and THP-1, A549 and Jurkat E6 cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; GB0139 decreased inflammation severity via a reduction in neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and neutrophil activation. GB0139 reduced LPS-mediated increases in interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, GB0139 inhibited Gal-3-induced neutrophil activation, monocyte IL-8 secretion, T cell apoptosis and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes encoding for IL-8, TNFα, IL-6 in alveolar epithelial cells in response to mechanical stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These data indicate that Gal-3 adopts a pro-inflammatory role following the early stages of lung injury and supports the development of GB0139, as a potential treatment approach in ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil trogocytosis during their trans-endothelial migration: role of extracellular CIRP</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35941574/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Neutrophils are the most abundant innate immune cells in the circulating blood, and they act as the first responder against bacterial and fungal infection. However, accumulation of activated neutrophils can cause severe inflammation and tissue damage. Recently, neutrophil trogocytosis or membrane transfer with neighboring cells was reported to modulate immune responses. Extracellular cold-inducible RNA binding protein (eCIRP) is a newly identified damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). eCIRP can activate neutrophils to be more pro-inflammatory. This study aimed to identify the role of eCIRP in neutrophil trogocytosis during their trans-endothelial migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A trans-endothelial migration (TEM) assay using bone marrow neutrophils and mouse primary lung vascular endothelial cells was conducted using transwell chambers and neutrophil trogocytosis was assessed in vitro. In an in vivo mouse model of acute lung injury, neutrophil trogocytosis was assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In TEM assay, the trogocytosis of neutrophils occurred during trans-endothelial migration and eCIRP significantly increased the percentage of these neutrophils. The trogocytosed neutrophils acquired the endothelial membrane containing junctional adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C) and VE-cadherin, and these membrane patches were polarized by Mac-1 binding. Furthermore, eCIRP-induced JAM-C positive trogocytosed neutrophils are more pro-inflammatory than the JAM-C negative counterpart. JAM-C positive trogocytosed neutrophils were also observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a mouse model of acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These data suggest that during the paracellular trans-endothelial migration of neutrophils in response to inflammation, eCIRP induces trogocytosis of neutrophils, and the trogocytosed neutrophils exhibit an exaggerated pro-inflammatory phenotype promoting acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) reside in a specialized niche that ensures their regenerative capacity. Although we know that innate immune cells infiltrate the niche in response to injury, it remains unclear how MuSCs adapt to this altered environment for initiating repair. Here, we demonstrate that inflammatory cytokine signaling from the regenerative niche impairs the ability of quiescent MuSCs to reenter the cell cycle. The histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase JMJD3, but not UTX, allowed MuSCs to overcome inhibitory inflammation signaling by removing trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) marks at the Has2 locus to initiate production of hyaluronic acid, which in turn established an extracellular matrix competent for integrating signals that direct MuSCs to exit quiescence. Thus, JMJD3-driven hyaluronic acid synthesis plays a proregenerative role that allows MuSC adaptation to inflammation and the initiation of muscle repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airway inflammation in asthma involves complex, interactive, and redundant cascades mediated by an array of proinflammatory cytokines, including a type 2 (T2) pattern of injury. T2 inflammation is characterized by elevations in absolute peripheral or sputum eosinophil counts and levels of IgE (total and allergen-specific) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide, which serve as biomarkers for the presence of this type of inflammation. T2 inflammation is mediated by key &amp;ldquo;downstream&amp;rdquo; cytokines, particularly IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which act at the effector cell level, as well as upstream cytokines, or &amp;ldquo;alarmins,&amp;rdquo; such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-25, and IL-33 generated by epithelial cells. The relevance of these pathways has led to the development of biologic therapies targeting these T2 cytokines, which have not only resulted in modifying these biomarker signatures for inflammation but have also reduced the disease burden associated with asthma exacerbations, systemic corticosteroid use, and lung function compromises. This review will summarize experiences with anticytokine biologics to highlight which specific asthma outcomes they affect and how these effects reflect inflammatory pathways modified by biologics and may relate to pathophysiologic features of asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cysteinyl Maresins Reprogram Macrophages to Protect Mice from Streptococcus pneumoniae after Influenza A Virus Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35913160/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Excess mortality during IAV epidemics and pandemics is attributable to secondary bacterial infections, particularly pneumonia caused by &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;. Resident alveolar macrophages (rAMs) are early responders to respiratory infections that coordinate initial host defense responses. Maresin conjugates in tissue regeneration (MCTRs) are recently elucidated cysteinyl maresins that are produced by and act on macrophages. Roles for MCTRs in responses to respiratory infections remain to be determined. Here, IAV infection led to transient decreases in rAM numbers. Repopulated lung macrophages displayed transcriptional alterations 21 days post-IAV with prolonged susceptibility to secondary pneumococcal infection. Administration of a mix of MCTR1 to 3 or MCTR3 alone post-IAV decreased lung inflammation and bacterial load 48 and 72 h after secondary pneumococcal infection. MCTR-exposed rAMs had increased migration and phagocytosis of &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, reduced secretion of CXCL1, and a reversion toward baseline levels of several IAV-induced pneumonia susceptibility genes. Together, MCTRs counter regulated post-IAV changes in rAMs to promote a rapid return of bacteria host defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a serious and common complication of IAV infection, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. New host-directed approaches are needed to complement antibiotics to better address this important global infectious disease. Here, we show that harnessing endogenous resolution mechanisms for inflammation by exogenous administration of a family of specialized proresolving mediators (i.e., cys-MCTRs) increased macrophage resilience mechanisms after IAV to protect against secondary infection from &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular histones induce inflammation and senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells by activating the AMPK/FOXO4 signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35913584/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is an abnormal immune-inflammatory response that is mainly caused by infection. It can lead to life-threatening organ dysfunction and death. Severely damaged tissue cells will release intracellular histones into the circulation as damage-related molecular patterns (DAMPs) to accelerate the systemic immune response. Although various histone-related cytotoxicity mechanisms have been explored, those that affect extracellular histones involved in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction are yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were stimulated with different concentrations of histones, and cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay. Cellular senescence was assessed by SA β-gal staining. C57BL/6 mice were treated with histones with or without BML-275 treatment. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 inflammasome proteins. The interaction of NLRP3 and ASC was detected by CoIP and immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we found that extracellular histones induced senescence and inflammatory response in a dose-dependent manner in cultured VSMCs. Histone treatment significantly promoted apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) as well as NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) interaction of inflammasomes in VSMCs. Forkhead box protein O4 (FOXO4), which is a downstream effector molecule of extracellular histones, was found to be involved in histone-regulated VSMC inflammatory response and senescence. Furthermore, the 5&amp;rsquo;-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway was confirmed to mediate extracellular histone-induced FOXO4 expression, and blocking this signaling pathway with an inhibitor can suppress vascular inflammation induced by extracellular histones &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Extracellular histones induce inflammation and senescence in VSMCs, and blocking the AMPK/FOXO4 pathway is a potential target for the treatment of histonemediated organ injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Monocyte Signature Associated with Herpes Simplex Virus Reactivation and Neurological Recovery after Brain Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35486851/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Brain injury induces systemic immunosuppression, increasing the risk of viral reactivations and altering neurological recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; To determine if systemic immune alterations and lung replication of herpesviridae are associated and can help predict outcomes after brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with severe brain injury requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. We systematically searched for respiratory herpes simplex virus (HSV) replications in tracheal aspirates. We also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and in vitro functional assays of monocytes and CD4 T cells collected on Day 1 to characterize the immune response to severe acute brain injury. The primary outcome was the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/em&gt; In 344 patients with severe brain injury, lung HSV reactivations were observed in 39% of the 232 patients seropositive for HSV and independently associated with poor neurological recovery at 6 months (hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.57). Weighted gene coexpression network analyses of the transcriptomic response of monocytes to brain injury defined a module of 721 genes, including PD-L1 and CD80, enriched for the binding DNA motif of the transcriptional factor Zeb2 and whose ontogenic analyses revealed decreased IFN-γ-mediated and antiviral response signaling pathways. This monocyte signature was preserved in a validation cohort and predicted the neurological outcome at 6 months with good accuracy (area under the curve, 0.786; 95% confidence interval, 0.593-0.978).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; A specific monocyte signature is associated with HSV reactivation and predicts poor recovery after brain injury. The alterations of the immune control of herpesviridae replication are understudied and represent a novel therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PARPI plus radiation further activated cGAS/STING pathway than single treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PARPI plus radiation upregulated the expression of PD-L1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PARPI plus radiation sensitizes small cell lung cancer to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly malignant tumor with extremely poor prognosis. The treatment strategy is very limited, and patient outcomes remain dismal with the 5-year survival rate being mere 3-6%. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies for SCLC patients are urgently needed. In this study, we found that the triple-therapy of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, radiotherapy (RT) and anti-PD-1 treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival in the syngeneic SCLC models in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the combination of PARP inhibitor niraparib and RT reshaped an inflamed tumor microenvironment, including activation of the cGAS/STING immune response pathway, induction of immunogenic cell death, and upregulation of PD-L1 on tumor cells. Furthermore, this triple-therapy substantially augmented CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation, and enhanced anti-tumor effects as revealed by increased median survival time and reduced tumor volume without additional myelosuppression or hepatic injury. Together, our studies demonstrated that PARP inhibitor combined with RT potentiated anti-tumor immunity and enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in preclinical study, which provided a promising therapeutic strategy for SCLC patients in clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of PP2A /NLRP3 signaling pathway in ambient particulate matter 2.5 induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35926746/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambient particulate matter 2.5 (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) exposure has been linked to pulmonary fibrosis. However, the key signaling pathways remained unclear. In the present study, we applied a mouse model with myeloid-specific deletion of Ppp2r1a gene (encoding protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) A subunit) to identify the key signaling pathways involved in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced pulmonary fibrosis. PP2A Aα-/- homozygote mice and matched wild-type (WT) littermates were exposed to filtered air (FA), unfiltered air (UA), and concentrated PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; (CA) in a real-ambient PM exposure system for 8 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively. The mice exposed to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; displayed a progressive inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, the expressions of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, caspase-1, ASC and IL-1β were increased in mice lung following PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, indicating PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure caused pulmonary inflammation by the NLRP3 pathways activation. Furthermore, the effects of PM exposure on pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, oxidative stress, and pulmonary function damage were significantly enhanced in PP2A-/- mice compared to WT mice, indicating the role of PP2A in the regulation of pulmonary injury induced by PM exposure. In vitro study confirmed that PP2A was involved in the PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced inflammation response and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Importantly, we identified PP2A regulated the activation of NLRP3 pathways by direct dephosphorylating IRE1α in response to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PP2A-IRE1α-NLRP3 signaling pathway played a crucial role in regulating the inflammation response, triggering the lung fibrogenesis upon PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Our findings provide new insights into regulatory role of PP2A in human diseases upon the PM exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fn14 exacerbates acute lung injury by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35907805/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Uncontrolled inflammation is an important factor in the occurrence and development of acute lung injury (ALI). Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), a plasma membrane-anchored receptor, takes part in the pathological process of a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. However, the role of Fn14 in ALI has not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate whether the activation of Fn14 exacerbated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In vivo, ALI was induced by intratracheal LPS-challenge combined with/without Fn14 receptor blocker aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) treatment in C57BL/6J mice. Following LPS administration, the survival rate, lung tissue injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, inflammatory factor secretion, oxidative stress, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation were assessed. In vitro, primary murine macrophages were used to evaluate the underlying mechanism by which Fn14 activated the NLRP3 inflammasome. Lentivirus was used to silence Fn14 to observe its effect on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we found that Fn14 expression was significantly increased in the lungs of LPS-induced ALI mice. The inhibition of Fn14 with ATA downregulated the protein expression of Fn14 in the lungs and improved the survival rate of mice receiving a lethal dose of LPS. ATA also attenuated lung tissue damage by decreasing the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, reducing inflammation, and suppressing oxidative stress. Importantly, we found that ATA strongly inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the lungs of ALI mice. Furthermore, in vitro, TWEAK, a natural ligand of Fn14, amplified the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the primary murine macrophage. By contrast, inhibition of Fn14 with shRNA decreased the expression of Fn14, NLRP3, Caspase-1 p10, and Caspase-1 p20, and the production of IL-1β and IL-18. Furthermore, the activation of Fn14 promoted the production of reactive oxygen species and inhibited the activation of Nrf2-HO-1 in activated macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study first reports that the activation of Fn14 aggravates ALI by amplifying the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, blocking Fn14 may be a potential way to treat ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PEtOxylated Interferon-α2a Bioconjugates Addressing H1N1 Influenza A Virus Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35904477/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A viruses (IAV), including the pandemic 2009 (pdm09) H1N1 or avian influenza H5N1 virus, may advance into more pathogenic, potentially antiviral drug-resistant strains (including loss of susceptibility against oseltamivir). Such IAV strains fuel the risk of future global outbreaks, to which this study responds by re-engineering Interferon-α2a (IFN-α2a) bioconjugates into influenza therapeutics. Type-I interferons such as IFN-α2a play an essential role in influenza infection and may prevent serious disease courses. We site-specifically conjugated a genetically engineered IFN-α2a mutant to poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)s (PEtOx) of different molecular weights by strain-promoted azide-alkyne cyclo-addition. The promising pharmacokinetic profile of the 25 kDa PEtOx bioconjugate in mice echoed an efficacy in IAV-infected ferrets. One intraperitoneal administration of this bioconjugate, but not the marketed IFN-α2a bioconjugate, changed the disease course similar to oseltamivir, given orally twice every study day. PEtOxylated IFN-α2a bioconjugates may expand our therapeutic arsenal against future influenza pandemics, particularly in light of rising first-line antiviral drug resistance to IAV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infections upregulated IL-17 production both in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virulent &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; strains could induced higher IL-17 production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-17 expression positively correlated with degree of pathological tissue injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infection induced IL-17 production through PKC-ERK/MAPK and IκB/NF-κB pathways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our previous study, the outer membrane protein P2 of &lt;em&gt;Glaesserella parasuis&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt;) induced the production of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in host cells. However, how the &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infection produces IL-17A in the host is unknown. In this study, at 48 hpi in piglets, the proportion of Th17 cells in the peripheral blood significantly increased as determined by flow cytometry, but the overall proportion was low. IL-17 mRNA and protein levels significantly increased in the lungs and spleens of infected piglets. Histopathological examination staining, immunohistochemistry and viability counts, revealed that IL-17 expression might be positively correlated with bacterial content and the degree of pathological injury in lung and spleen tissues. Furthermore, when infected with the &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; Nagasaki strain compared with avirulent strain C5, the primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) significantly produced IL-17 in a time-dose dependent manner. In addition, we demonstrated that PKC, MEK and NF-κB signaling pathways were essential for &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt;-induced IL-17 production because the addition of corresponding inhibitors dramatically reduced IL-17 mRNA production. The phosphorylation levels of PKC, ERK1/2 and IκB in &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt;-infected primary PAMs also increased significantly as the infection dose increased as assessed by western blotting. Thus, these finding imply that IL-17 induced by &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infection is dependent on activation of PKC-ERK/MAPK and IκB/NF-κB signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The EGFR/ErbB inhibitor neratinib modifies the neutrophil phosphoproteome and promotes apoptosis and clearance by airway macrophages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulated neutrophilic inflammation can be highly destructive in chronic inflammatory diseases due to prolonged neutrophil lifespan and continual release of histotoxic mediators in inflamed tissues. Therapeutic induction of neutrophil apoptosis, an immunologically silent form of cell death, may be beneficial in these diseases, provided that the apoptotic neutrophils are efficiently cleared from the tissue. Previous research in our group identified ErbB inhibitors as able to induce neutrophil apoptosis and reduce neutrophilic inflammation both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Here, we extend that work using a clinical ErbB inhibitor, neratinib, which has the potential to be repurposed in inflammatory diseases. We show that neratinib reduces neutrophilic migration o an inflammatory site in zebrafish larvae. Neratinib upregulates efferocytosis and reduces the number of persisting neutrophil corpses in mouse models of acute, but not chronic, lung injury, suggesting that the drug may have therapeutic benefits in acute inflammatory settings. Phosphoproteomic analysis of human neutrophils shows that neratinib modifies the phosphorylation of proteins regulating apoptosis, migration, and efferocytosis. This work identifies a potential mechanism for neratinib in treating acute lung inflammation by upregulating the clearance of dead neutrophils and, through examination of the neutrophil phosphoproteome, provides important insights into the mechanisms by which this may be occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oral IRAK4 inhibitor BAY-1834845 prevents acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRAK4 inhibition is a potentially feasible treatment for ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BAY-1834845 shows unexpectedly discrepant efficacy in vivo with PF-06650833.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BAY-1834845 inhibits natural immunity signaling stronger than dexamethasone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lethal clinical entity that has become an emergency event with the outbreak of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no well-proven pharmacotherapies except dexamethasone. This study is aimed to evaluate IRAK4 inhibitors as a potential treatment for ARDS-cytokine release syndrome (CRS). We applied two IRAK4 inhibitors, BAY-1834845 and PF-06650833 to an inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS mouse model with control of high dose dexamethasone (10 mg/kg). Unexpectedly, although both compounds had excellent IC50 on IRAK4 kinase activity, only BAY-1834845 but not PF-06650833 or high dose dexamethasone could significantly prevent lung injury according to a blinded pathology scoring. Further, only BAY-1834845 and BAY-1834845 combined with dexamethasone could effectively improve the injury score of pre-existed ARDS. Compared with PF-06650833 and high dose dexamethasone, BAY-1834845 remarkably decreased inflammatory cells infiltrating lung tissue and neutrophil count in BALF. BAY-1834845, DEX, and the combination of the two agents could decrease BALF total T cells, monocyte, and macrophages. In further cell type enrichment analysis based on lung tissue RNA-seq, both BAY-1834845 and dexamethasone decreased signatures of inflammatory cells and effector lymphocytes. Interestingly, unlike the dexamethasone group, BAY-1834845 largely preserved the signatures of naïve lymphocytes and stromal cells such as endothelial cells, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells. Differential gene enrichment suggested that BAY-1834845 downregulated genes more efficiently than dexamethasone, especially TNF, IL-17, interferon, and Toll-like receptor signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting ETosis by miR-155 inhibition mitigates mixed granulocytic asthmatic lung inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthma is phenotypically heterogeneous with several distinctive pathological mechanistic pathways. Previous studies indicate that neutrophilic asthma has a poor response to standard asthma treatments comprising inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, it is important to identify critical factors that contribute to increased numbers of neutrophils in asthma patients whose symptoms are poorly controlled by conventional therapy. Leukocytes release chromatin fibers, referred to as extracellular traps (ETs) consisting of double-stranded (ds) DNA, histones, and granule contents. Excessive components of ETs contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma; however, it is unclear how ETs drive asthma phenotypes and whether they could be a potential therapeutic target. We employed a mouse model of severe asthma that recapitulates the intricate immune responses of neutrophilic and eosinophilic airway inflammation identified in patients with severe asthma. We used both a pharmacologic approach using miR-155 inhibitor-laden exosomes and genetic approaches using miR-155 knockout mice. Our data show that ETs are present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with mild asthma subjected to experimental subsegmental bronchoprovocation to an allergen and a severe asthma mouse model, which resembles the complex immune responses identified in severe human asthma. Furthermore, we show that miR-155 contributes to the extracellular release of dsDNA, which exacerbates allergic lung inflammation, and the inhibition of miR-155 results in therapeutic benefit in severe asthma mice. Our findings show that targeting dsDNA release represents an attractive therapeutic target for mitigating neutrophilic asthma phenotype, which is clinically refractory to standard care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress play critical roles in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colchicine (COL) mitigates severe acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury (SAP-ALI) in rats model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colchicine limits inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress in SAP-ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress contribute to the development of severe acute pancreatitis-associated acute lung injury (SAP-ALI). Currently, there is no curative treatment for SAP-ALI in the clinic. This study investigated the potential therapeutic role and mechanisms of colchicine in a rat model of SAP-ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized and administrated intragastrically with vehicle saline or colchicine (0.5 mg/kg/day) for seven days, followed by injecting sodium taurocholate to induce SAP-ALI. Together with a healthy control group of rats, their pancreatic and lung tissues and plasma samples were collected for histology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with the sham controls, the SAP group of rats with vehicle saline treatment displayed severe damages, inflammation with many neutrophil and macrophage infiltrates in pancreatic and lung tissues, accompanied by elevated levels of plasma interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which were significantly mitigated in colchicine-treated SAP + COL group of rats. Furthermore, colchicine treatment significantly attenuated nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)-p65, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 4-Hydroxynonenal expression, ROS production and cell apoptosis by decreasing caspase-3 cleavage, Bax expression, but increasing Bcl-2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in pancreatic and lung tissues, relative to the SAP group of rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Colchicine treatment significantly mitigated the severity of SAP-ALI by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in rats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular Histones Activate Endothelial NLRP3 Inflammasome and are Associated with a Severe Sepsis Phenotype</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35915852/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Circulating extracellular histones acquire relevance as cytotoxic mediators in sepsis. Extracellular histones act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which induce oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Inflammasome mediates pyroptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism that produces inflammation. Despite evidence for inflammasome activation in immune cells during sepsis, it was unknown whether extracellular histones can produce endothelial inflammasomes activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to explore the activation of pyroptosis, endothelial function and inflammation by extracellular histones. We evaluated pyroptosis by flow cytometry, caspase-1 activity assay, and gene and protein expression analysis by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively. The upstream molecular responses involved in pyroptosis activation by extracellular histones were validated by means of using antioxidant glutathione ethyl ester and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors. Finally, using mass spectrometry, we measured circulating histones in blood from critically-ill patients and demonstrated that circulating histone levels correlated with the expression of pyroptosis-related cytokines, the release of endothelial adhesion factors and septic shock severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that extracellular histones mediate the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis in endothelial cells by contributing to endothelial dysfunction and the dysregulation of the immune response mediated by endothelium. Likewise, we demonstrated how the hyperacetylation of extracellular histones or the use of antioxidants decreased pyroptosis. In addition, we showed that pyroptosis is a feasible process occurring in septic shock patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt; Circulating histone levels correlated with the expression of pro-inflammatory and pyroptosis-related cytokines, the release of endothelial adhesion factors and septic shock severity. We propose to block histone-mediated pyroptosis as a feasible therapeutic strategy in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interferon-β regulates proresolving lipids to promote the resolution of acute airway inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35878041/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberrant immune responses, including hyperresponsiveness to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, underlie acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Type I interferons confer antiviral activities and could also regulate the inflammatory response, whereas little is known about their actions to resolve aberrant inflammation. Here we report that interferon-β (IFN-β) exerts partially overlapping, but also cooperative actions with aspirin-triggered 15-epi-lipoxin A4 (15-epi-LXA4) and 17-epi-resolvin D1 to counter TLR9-generated cues to regulate neutrophil apoptosis and phagocytosis in human neutrophils. In mice, TLR9 activation impairs bacterial clearance, prolongs Escherichia coli-evoked lung injury, and suppresses production of IFN-β and the proresolving lipid mediators 15-epi-LXA4 and resolvin D1 (RvD1) in the lung. Neutralization of endogenous IFN-β delays pulmonary clearance of E. coli and aggravates mucosal injury. Conversely, treatment of mice with IFN-β accelerates clearance of bacteria, restores neutrophil phagocytosis, promotes neutrophil apoptosis and efferocytosis, and accelerates resolution of airway inflammation with concomitant increases in 15-epi-LXA4 and RvD1 production in the lungs. Pharmacological blockade of the lipoxin receptor ALX/FPR2 partially prevents IFN-β-mediated resolution. These findings point to a pivotal role of IFN-β in orchestrating timely resolution of neutrophil and TLR9 activation-driven airway inflammation and uncover an IFN-β-initiated resolution program, activation of an ALX/FPR2-centered, proresolving lipids-mediated circuit, for ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and its severe form Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are the major cause of ICU death worldwide. ALI/ARDS is characterized by severe hypoxemia and inflammation that leads to poor lung compliance. Despite many advances in understanding and management, ALI/ARDS is still causing significant morbidity and mortality. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a fast-growing topic in lung inflammation and injury. lncRNA is a class of non-coding RNA having a length of more than 200 nucleotides. It has been a center of research for understanding the pathophysiology of various diseases in the past few years. Multiple studies have shown that lncRNAs are abundant in acute lung injury/injuries in mouse models and cell lines. By targeting these long non-coding RNAs, many investigators have demonstrated the alleviation of ALI in various mouse models. Therefore, lncRNAs show great promise as a therapeutic target in ALI. This review provides the current state of knowledge about the relationship between lncRNAs in various biological processes in acute lung injury and its use as a potential therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MASP-2 and MASP-3 inhibitors block complement activation, inflammation, and microvascular stasis in a murine model of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35878790/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have ongoing hemolysis that promotes endothelial injury, complement activation, inflammation, vaso-occlusion, ischemia-reperfusion pathophysiology, and pain. Complement activation markers are increased in SCD in steady-state and further increased during vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). However, the mechanisms driving complement activation in SCD have not been completely elucidated. Ischemia-reperfusion and heme released from hemoglobin during hemolysis, events that characterize SCD pathophysiology, can activate the lectin pathway (LP) and alternative pathway (AP), respectively. Here we evaluated the role of LP and AP in Townes sickle (SS) mice using inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)-2 or MASP-3, respectively. Townes SS mice were pretreated with MASP-2 mAb, MASP-3 mAb, isotype control mAb, or PBS before they were challenged with hypoxia-reoxygenation or hemoglobin. Pretreatment of SS mice with MASP-2 or MASP-3 mAb, markedly reduced Bb fragments, C4d and C5a in plasma and complement deposition in the liver, kidneys, and lungs collected 4 hours after challenge compared to control mAb-treated mice. Consistent with complement inhibition, hepatic inflammation markers NF-ĸB phospho-p65, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin were significantly reduced in SS mice pretreated with MASP-2 or MASP-3 mAb. Importantly, MASP-2 or MASP-3 mAb pretreatment significantly inhibited microvascular stasis (vaso-occlusion) induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation or hemoglobin. These studies suggest that the LP and the AP are both playing a role in promoting inflammation and vaso-occlusion in SCD. Inhibiting complement activation via the LP or the AP might inhibit inflammation and prevent VOC in SCD patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Allergic respiratory diseases have increased dramatically due to air pollution over the past few decades. However, studies are limited on the effects of inorganic components and particulate matter with different particle sizes in smog on allergic diseases, and the possible molecular mechanism of inducing allergies has not been thoroughly studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Four common mineral elements with different particle sizes in smog particles were selected, including Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We studied the relationship and molecular mechanism of smog particle composition, particle size, and allergic reactions using mast cells, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) model, and an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic mouse model in vitro and in vivo, combined with transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission X-ray microscopy analysis, and transcriptome sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Only 20 nm SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles significantly increased β-hexosaminidase release, based on dinitrophenol (DNP)-human serum albumin (HSA) stimulation, from IgE-sensitized mast cells, while other particles did not. Meanwhile, the PCA model showed that Evan&amp;rsquo;s blue extravasation in mice was increased after treatment with nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles. Nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles exposure in the asthmatic mouse model caused an enhancement of allergic airway inflammation as manifested by OVA-specific serum IgE, airway hyperresponsiveness, lung inflammation injury, mucous cell metaplasia, cytokine expression, mast cell activation, and histamine secretion, which were significantly increased. Nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles exposure did not affect the expression of FcϵRI or the ability of mast cells to bind IgE but synergistically activated mast cells by enhancing the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, especially the phosphorylation levels of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. The ERK inhibitors showed a significant inhibitory effect in reducing β-hexosaminidase release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results indicated that nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles stimulation might synergistically activate IgE-sensitized mast cells by enhancing the MAPK signaling pathway and that nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles exposure could exacerbate allergic inflammation. Our experimental results provide useful information for preventing and treating allergic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anti-inflammatory protective effect of ADAMTS-13 in murine arthritis models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35875933/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have frequent thrombotic events with endothelial dysfunction. Von Willebrand factor (VWF) has been shown to bind neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and NETs are part of RA etiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; This study aims to elucidate whether this prothrombotic status exacerbates inflammation in arthritis. Here we focus on the involvement of A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13), an enzyme cleaving VWF and its effect on NET deposition and RA development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We evaluated the influence of the Adamts13 gene and recombinant human ADAMTS-13 (rhADAMTS-13) on arthritis in the mouse models of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We also assessed VWF and NETs in synovial tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Several &lt;em&gt;Adamts13&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice developed arthritis, while &lt;em&gt;Adamts13&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; siblings did not. Synovial tissue from &lt;em&gt;Adamts13&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; showed accumulation of NETs. Treatment of DBA/1 J mice, an arthritis-susceptible strain, with well-tolerated doses of rhADAMT13 reduced arthritis incidence and alleviated the severity of arthritis. Mice treated with rhADAMT13 presented less serum interleukin 6 and less bone erosion determined by micro-computed tomography. The effects on arthritis severity were observed both when administering rhADAMTS-13 prophylactically and also when given after arthritis has developed. In both conditions, rhADAMTS-13 reduced VWF and NET deposition on proliferated synovial tissue evaluated by immunoblotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results demonstrate the inhibitory role of &lt;em&gt;Adamts13&lt;/em&gt; in murine arthritis and the effectiveness of rhADAMTS-13 treatment. Additionally, this study suggests that deposition of VWF in the synovium and subsequent pathogenic NET retention promotes arthritis. Treatment with rhADAMTS-13 provides a potential therapeutic approach targeting inflammation and pro-thrombotic state in arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ceria nanoparticles prophylactic used for renal ischemia-reperfusion injury treatment by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammatory response</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35926357/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury (RIRI) is the leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), a common disease with high morbidity and mortality. However, due to the lack of effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools, patients have to resort to conservative treatment. To address this issue, we have developed a novel prophylactic strategy that involves the pre-treatment use of ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) before surgery. Based on our careful study of the three different sizes of CNPs that we synthesized, 46 nm (NP46), 81 nm (NP81), and 118 nm (NP118), we have found that NP118 can be used as effective prophylactic agents against RIRI and subsequent renal fibrosis. In our experiments, the CNPs exhibited excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro and effectively protected the kidney against RIRI and renal fibrosis in vivo, as proved by the decreases in renal lesions, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, apoptotic cell, KIM-1 expression, and fibrotic area in CNPs treated samples relative to RIRI group. Mechanistically, not only did the CNPs reduce oxidative stress by regulating the Nrf2 pathway, but they also attenuated RIRI induced inflammatory response by decreasing macrophage infiltration and polarization to M1 phenotype, and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. In vitro results further confirmed that CNPs pre-treatment not only dramatically decreased intracellular ROS production in renal tubular epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells, but also effectively attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells. In addition, we found that one fourth of the NP118 persisted for more than 21 days in IR kidneys, and that out of the three sizes of CNPs, NP118 achieved the best results in all our experiments. Our study provides new insights into the usage and majorization of CNPs as a potential therapy to treat or prevent RIRI and renal fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of Immuno-Inflammatory Signals in Liver Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35883665/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major obstacle in liver resection and liver transplantation. The initial step of IRI is mediated through ischemia which promotes the production of reactive oxygen species in Kupffer cells. This furthermore promotes the activation of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, interferon, inducible nitric oxide synthase, TLR9/nuclear-factor kappa B pathway, and the production of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as ATP, histone, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), urate, mitochondrial formyl peptides and S100 proteins. With ongoing cell death of hepatocytes during the ischemic phase, DAMPs are built up and released into the circulation upon reperfusion. This promotes a cytokines/chemokine storm that attracts neutrophils and other immune cells to the site of tissue injury. The effect of IRI is further aggravated by the release of cytokines and chemokines, such as epithelial neutrophil activating protein (CXCL5), KC (CXCL1) and MIP-2 (CXCL2), the complement proteins C3a and C5a, mitochondrial-derived formyl peptides, leukotriene B4 and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) from migrating neutrophils. These NETs can also activate platelets and form Neutrophil-platelet microthrombi to further worsen ischemia in the liver. In this review we aim to summarize the current knowledge of mediators that promote liver IRI, and we will discuss the role of neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps in mediating IRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CXCR2 Is Essential for Radiation-Induced Intestinal Injury by Initiating Neutrophil Infiltration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35879949/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils, known as an important part of the immune system, are the most abundant leukocyte population in peripheral blood, but excessive recruitment will lead to tissue/organ injury. RNA sequencing showed that ionizing radiation significantly increased the expression of characteristic genes of neutrophils in intestinal tissues compared with liver and lung tissues. By clearing neutrophils with an anti-Ly6G antibody, we found that neutrophil infiltration is critical for irradiation-induced intestinal injury. CXCR2 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that mediates the migration of neutrophils by combining with its ligands. Compared with observations in liver and lung tissues, we found that CXCR2 and its ligands, including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL5, were all significantly upregulated in irradiated intestinal tissues. Further studies showed that SB225002, an inhibitor of CXCR2, could effectively inhibit the chemotaxis of neutrophils and tissue damage mediated by the CXCL-CXCR2 signalling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plk2-mediated phosphorylation and translocalization of Nrf2 activates anti-inflammation through p53/Plk2/p21cip1 signaling in acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35842499/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plk2 is a cellular stress-responsive factor that is induced in response to oxidative stress. However, the roles of Plk2 in acute kidney injury (AKI) have not been clarified. We previously found that Plk2 is an interacting factor of Nrf2 in response to cellular stress, since Plk2 is upregulated in the Nrf2-dependent network. Here, we show that the levels of p53, Plk2, p21&lt;sup&gt;cip1&lt;/sup&gt;, and chromatin-bound Nrf2 were all upregulated in kidney tissues of mice or NRK52E cells treated with either cisplatin or methotrexate. Upregulation of Plk2 by p53 led to an increase of Nrf2 in both soluble and chromatin fractions in cisplatin-treated NRK52E cells. Consistently, depletion of Plk2 suppressed the levels of Nrf2. Of note, Plk2 directly phosphorylated Nrf2 at Ser40, which facilitated its interaction with p21&lt;sup&gt;cip1&lt;/sup&gt; and translocation into the nuclei for the activation of anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory factors in response to AKI. Together, these findings suggest that Plk2 may serve as an anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory regulator through the phosphorylation and activation of Nrf2 to protect kidney cells from kidney toxicants and that Plk2 and Nrf2 therefore work cooperatively for the protection and survival of kidney cells from harmful stresses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A comprehensive network map of IL-17A signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35838944/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is one of the member of IL-17 family consisting of other five members (IL-17B to IL-17F). The Gamma delta (γδ) T cells and T helper 17 (Th17) cells are the major producers of IL-17A. Aberrant signaling by IL-17A has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury, chronic airway diseases, and cancer. Activation of the IL-17A/IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) system regulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT serine/threonine kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) mediated signaling pathways. The IL-17RA activation orchestrates multiple downstream signaling cascades resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, chemokines (C-X-C motif) and promotes neutrophil-mediated immune response. Considering the biomedical importance of IL-17A, we developed a pathway resource of signaling events mediated by IL-17A/IL-17RA in this study. The curation of literature data pertaining to the IL-17A system was performed manually by the NetPath criteria. Using data mined from the published literature, we describe an integrated pathway reaction map of IL-17A/IL-17RA consisting of 114 proteins and 68 reactions. That includes detailed information on IL-17A/IL-17RA mediated signaling events of 9 activation/inhibition events, 17 catalysis events, 3 molecular association events, 68 gene regulation events, 109 protein expression events, and 6 protein translocation events. The IL-17A signaling pathway map data is made freely accessible through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5242&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WikiPathways Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Combustion-Derived Particulate PAHs Associated with Small Airway Dysfunction in Elderly Patients with COPD</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35834827/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence of the respiratory effects of ambient organic aerosols (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) among patients with chronic diseases is limited. We aimed to assess whether exposure to ambient particle-bound PAHs could worsen small airway functions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Forty-five COPD patients were recruited with four repeated visits in 2014-2015 in Beijing, China. Parameters of pulmonary function and pulmonary/systemic inflammation and oxidative stress were measured at each visit. Linear mixed-effect models were performed to evaluate the associations between PAHs and measurements. In this study, participants experienced an average PAH level of 61.7 ng/m3. Interquartile range increases in exposure to particulate PAHs at prior up to 7 days were associated with reduced small airway functions, namely, decreases of 17.7-35.5% in forced maximal mid-expiratory flow. Higher levels of particulate PAHs were also associated with heightened lung injury and inflammation and oxidative stress. Stronger overall effects were found for PAHs from traffic emissions and coal burning. Exposure to ambient particulate PAHs was capable of impairing small airway functions in elderly patients with COPD, potentially via inflammation and oxidative stress. These findings highlight the importance of control efforts on organic particulate matter from fossil fuel combustion emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interleukin 24 promotes cell death in renal epithelial cells and is associated with acute renal injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35801504/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a major cause of acute kidney injury. Many cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. IL24 is a member of the IL10 family and has gained importance because of its apoptosis-inducing effects in tumor disease besides its immunoregulative function. Littles is known about the role of IL24 in kidney disease. Using a mouse model, we found that IL24 is upregulated in the kidney after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and that tubular epithelial cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells are the source of IL24. Mice lacking IL24 are protected from renal injury and inflammation. Cell culture studies showed that IL24 induces apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells, which is accompanied by an increased endoplasmatic reticulum stress response. Moreover, IL24 induces robust expression of endogenous IL24 in tubular cells, fostering ER-stress and apoptosis. In kidney transplant recipients with delayed graft function and patients at high risk to develop acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery IL24 is upregulated in the kidney and serum. Taken together, IL24 can serve as a biomarker, plays an important mechanistic role involving both extracellular and intracellular targets, and is a promising therapeutic target in patients at risk of or with ischemia-induced acute kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>p53/sirtuin 1/NF-κB Signaling Axis in Chronic Inflammation and Maladaptive Kidney Repair After Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35874713/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation contributes to maladaptive kidney repair, but its regulation is unclear. Here, we report that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is downregulated after repeated low-dose cisplatin (RLDC) injury, and this downregulation leads to p65 acetylation and consequent NF-κB activation resulting in a persistent inflammatory response. RLDC induced the down-regulation of SIRT1 and activation of NF-κB, which were accompanied by chronic tubular damage, tubulointerstitial inflammation, and fibrosis in mice. Inhibition of NF-κB suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic phenotypes in RLDC-treated renal tubular cells. SIRT1 activation by its agonists markedly reduced the acetylation of p65 (a key component of NF-κB), resulting in the attenuation of the inflammatory and fibrotic responses. Conversely, knockdown of SIRT1 exacerbated these cellular changes. At the upstream, p53 was activated after RLDC treatment to repress SIRT1, resulting in p65 acetylation, NF-κB activation and transcription of inflammatory cytokines. In mice, SIRT1 agonists attenuated RLDC-induced chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and renal fibrosis. Together, these results unveil the p53/SIRT1/NF-κB signaling axis in maladaptive kidney repair following RLDC treatment, where p53 represses SIRT1 to increase p65 acetylation for NF-κB activation, leading to chronic renal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recapitulating influenza virus infection and facilitating antiviral and neuroprotective screening in tractable brain organoids</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35910807/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human pluripotent stem cell derived brain organoids offer an unprecedented opportunity for various applications as &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; model. Currently, human brain organoids as models have been used to understand virus-induced neurotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The brain organoids were separately challenged by multiple viruses including influenza viruses (H1N1-WSN and H3N2-HKT68), Enteroviruses (EV68 and EV71) and Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV) to investigate the impaired effect of these viruses on human brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The brain organoids challenged by influenza viruses had decreased overall organoid size, while enteroviruses infected brain organoids displayed the opposite result. Then, we found WSN preferentially infected MAP2+ neurons compared to SOX2+ neural stem cells (NSCs) and GFAP+ astrocytes in brain organoids, and induced apoptosis of NSCs and neurons, and released inflammatory factors (TNF-α, INF-γ, and IL-6), facilitating brain damage. Furthermore, transcriptional profiling revealed several co-upregulated genes (&lt;em&gt;CSAG3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;OAS2&lt;/em&gt;) and co-downregulated genes (&lt;em&gt;CDC20B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;KCNJ13&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;OTX2-AS1&lt;/em&gt;) after WSN infection for 24 hpi and 96 hpi, implicating target for antiviral drugs development. Finally, we explored compound PYC-12 could significantly suppress virus infection, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, we established a tractable experimental model to investigate the impact and mechanism of virus infection on human brain development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Product Is Involved in the Inflammatory Response of Human Adenovirus-Infected Patients</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35875560/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human adenovirus (HAdV) infection causes excessive inflammation associated with severe tissue injury, such as pneumonia. The molecules involved in the underlying inflammatory mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) is mainly expressed on immune cells and lung tissues, and it is a key factor in the initiation and development of inflammation. RAGE can be cleaved by metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) to release the extracellular segment, which is named soluble RAGE (sRAGE), into the intercellular space, where it can bind to RAGE ligands and block RAGE activation and subsequent inflammation. In our study, we enrolled HAdV-infected patients and their contacts to examine the relationship between sRAGE and inflammation induced by HAdV infection. The results showed that HAdV infection stimulated inflammatory cytokine secretion, increased such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels, and suppressed sRAGE expression. sRAGE levels were significantly different between patients with or without pneumonia. We also found that MMP9 was significantly lower in patients with pneumonia, and it was positively correlated with sRAGE levels over 7 days after disease onset. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is an important immune activation signaling pathway that is regulated by RAGE. We observed the activation of the MAPK pathway in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients. Negative correlations between sRAGE and phosphorylated JNK and p38 were observed. These results suggest that sRAGE is involved in HAdV-induced inflammatory responses, and might be a potential therapeutic target to alleviate the HAdV-induced excessive inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MUC1-mediated Macrophage Activation Promotes Colitis-associated Colorectal Cancer via Activating the Interleukin-6/ Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 Axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35809803/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; MUC1 is abnormally expressed in colorectal cancer, including colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), but its role in tumorigenesis is unclear. This study investigated MUC1&amp;rsquo;s effects in murine models of colitis and CAC and elucidated mechanisms of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Colitis and CAC were induced in mice by exposure to dextran sodium sulfate or azoxymethane plus dextran sodium sulphate. Clinical parameters, immune cell infiltration, and tumor development were monitored throughout disease progression. Experiments in knockout mice and bone marrow chimeras were combined with an exploration of immune cell abundance and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Deficiency of Muc1 suppressed inflammation, inhibited tumor progression, increased abundance of CD8+ T lymphocytes, and reduced abundance of macrophages in colon tumors. Bone marrow chimeras showed promotion of CAC was primarily mediated by Muc1-expressing hematopoietic cells, and that MUC1 promoted a pro-tumoral immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype within tumors. Mechanistic studies revealed that Muc1 deficiency remarkably reduced interleukin-6 levels in the colonic tissues and tumors that was mainly produced by infiltrating macrophages at day 21, 42, and 85. In bone marrow-derived macrophages, MUC1 promoted responsiveness to chemoattractant and promoted activation into a phenotype with high Il6 and Ido1 expression, secreting factors which inhibited CD8+ T cell proliferation. MUC1 potently drives macrophages to produce interleukin-6, which in turn drives a pro-tumorigenic activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in colon epithelial tumor and stromal cells, ultimately increasing the occurrence and development of CAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings provide cellular and molecular mechanisms for the pro-tumorigenic functions of MUC1 in the inflamed colon. Therapeutic strategies to inhibit MUC1 signal transduction warrant consideration for the prevention or therapy of CAC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil and Macrophage Response in Acinetobacter Baumannii Infection and Their Relationship to Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35873147/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) infection has become a threat to global public health. AB is one of the main pathogens causing nosocomial infections, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia. AB easily develops resistance against a variety of antibiotics, which makes the treatment of AB infections difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to study new treatment plans like anti-infection immunity. Both animal models of AB infection and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; cell experiments show that macrophages are activated in the early stage of the immune response and regulate the recruitment of neutrophils, thus playing a role in clearing AB. AB components and the immune responses they induce can lead to injury of the infected organ, mostly in the lungs. Understanding the response of innate immunity to ABs at different stages after infection and the relationship between the response and lung injury can help to develop new immunotherapy methods and prevent lung injury. This article provides a comprehensive review of the response of neutrophils and macrophages to AB infection and their association with lung injury to develop effective therapies for AB infection and prevent lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lysophosphatidylcholine Alleviates Acute Lung Injury by Regulating Neutrophil Motility and Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35859904/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is predominantly initiated by bacterial infection and can cause systemic inflammation, which frequently leads to rapid death of the patient. However, this acute systemic inflammatory response requires further investigation from the perspectives of clinical judgment criteria and early treatment strategies for the relief of symptoms. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 18:0 may relieve septic symptoms, but the relevant mechanism is not clearly understood. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of LPC as a therapeutic treatment for acute inflammation in the lung induced by lipopolysaccharide in mice. Systemic inflammation of mice was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inoculation to investigate the role of LPC in the migration and the immune response of neutrophils during acute lung injury. By employing two-photon intravital imaging of the LPS-stimulated LysM-GFP mice and other &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; assays, we examined whether LPC alleviates the inflammatory effect of sepsis. We also tested the effect of LPC to human neutrophils from healthy control and sepsis patients. Our data showed that LPC treatment reduced the infiltration of innate immune cells into the lung. Specifically, LPC altered neutrophil migratory patterns and enhanced phagocytic efficacy in the damaged lung. Moreover, LPC treatment reduced the release of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET), which can damage tissue in the inflamed organ and exacerbate disease. It also reduced human neutrophil migration under inflammatory environment. Our results suggest that LPC can alleviate sepsis-induced lung inflammation by regulating the function of neutrophils. These findings provide evidence for the beneficial application of LPC treatment as a potential therapeutic strategy for sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) is always associated with the degradation of cartilage matrix during osteoarthritis (OA). The development of novel nanoenzymes with excellent ROS scavenging ability and biosafety shows great potentials for improving OA treatment. Herein a novel functional polydopamine (P) loading with ultrasmall Pt and Cu nanoparticles (P@Pt@Cu) was developed to act as nanoenzymes to scavenge ROS for OA treatment, wherein the excellent catalytic activities of Pt and Cu were employed. Results showed that P@Pt@Cu simultaneously presented obvious enzyme-mimicking properties like superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, leading to excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in H2O2 stimulated chondrocytes and OA joints with low cytotoxicity, leading to significant alleviation of OA progression. Besides, near infrared stimulation strengthened the antioxidant and anti-inflammation ability of P@Pt@Cu, resulting in the most prominent therapeutic effects. The proposed polydopamine-based nanoenzymes inspired a novel therapeutic strategy for OA therapy in clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 0111 Protects Against Influenza Virus by Modulating Intestinal Microbial-Mediated Immune Responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35847111/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations of traditional influenza vaccines concerning novel mutant strains. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop preventive means for antigen-unrelated types of influenza viruses. Recent studies have shown that probiotics can modulate the immune system and reduce the severity of viral infections. In this study, we investigated the potential of &lt;em&gt;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 against influenza virus H9N2. Challenge experiments showed that &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 pretreatments could effectively improve mice&amp;rsquo;s survival rate and weight loss and reduce the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) along with the degree of lung and intestinal injury. FMT experiment demonstrates that the protective effect produced by &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 is associated with gut microorganisms. In addition, 16S high-throughput sequencing of the mouse intestinal microbiota showed that &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 remodeled the intestinal microbiota after H9N2 infection and maintained the gut microbiota balance. In a mouse model, the oral administration of &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 increased IFN-β expression in the serum and BALF. At the same time, the transcript levels of IFN-β and related ISGs in the intestine and lungs of mice were also increased. In addition, the activation and polarization of T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and the spleen were detected by flow cytometry, and the results showed that &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 modulated cytokines in T cells and increased IgA expression in B cells in the MLNs and spleen. Thus, &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 may improve gut microbiota-mediated immune responses and thus, resist infection by the influenza virus, and it could be used as an effective preventive measure against the influenza virus.

      <title>FGF1 alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via suppression of inflammation and oxidative stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35764933/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are devastating clinical disorders with high mortality, and for which more effective therapies are urgently needed. FGF1, the prototype member of the FGF family, is shown to exert protective effects against injurious stimuli in multiple disease models. Here we aimed to evaluate whether FGF1 pretreatment is protective against LPS-induced ALI and elucidate the potential underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; For drug-treated groups, C57B/6 mice received a single i.p. injection of FGF1 (1 mg/kg) 1 h before the LPS challenge or not. To induce the ALI model, the mice were treated by intratracheal instillation of LPS (5 mg/kg). Then, histopathological changes in lung tissues were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. ELISA and qPCR assays were used to detect pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in BALF and lung tissues, respectively. The total number of inflammatory cells (neutrophils and macrophages) in BALF were counted using the Wright-Giemsa method. The expressions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using their respective kits. Western blot and immunostaining were used to evaluate the expressions of antioxidants (Nrf-2, HO-1, SOD2, GPX4, and Catalase), as well as the inflammatory and/or apoptosis-related factors (TLR4, NF-κB, and Cleaved- caspase 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; FGF1 pretreatment significantly ameliorated the LPS-induced histopathological changes, reduced lung wet/dry ratios, ROS and MDA levels, total BALF protein, inflammatory cell infiltration, proinflammatory cytokine levels, and significantly increased the expression of antioxidant proteins (Nrf-2, HO-1, Catalase, and SOD2). In addition, FGF1 pretreatment significantly reduced the expression of TLR4 and cleaved- caspase 3, inhibited NF-κB activation, and reduced LPS-induced cell apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Altogether, our results suggest that FGF1 pretreatment is protective against LPS-induced ALI through mediating anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may be attributed to the downregulation of TLR4 expression and inhibition of NF-κB activation, as well as promotion of antioxidant defenses. Therefore, FGF1 administration may prove beneficial in preventative strategies for ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brown adipose tissue-derived MaR2 contributes to cold-induced resolution of inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity induces chronic inflammation resulting in insulin resistance and metabolic disorders. Cold exposure can improve insulin sensitivity in humans and rodents, but the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we find that cold resolves obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance and improves glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice. The beneficial effects of cold exposure on improving obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance depend on brown adipose tissue (BAT) and liver. Using targeted liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, we discovered that cold and β3-adrenergic stimulation promote BAT to produce maresin 2 (MaR2), a member of the specialized pro-resolving mediators of bioactive lipids that play a role in the resolution of inflammation. Notably, MaR2 reduces inflammation in obesity in part by targeting macrophages in the liver. Thus, BAT-derived MaR2 could contribute to the beneficial effects of BAT activation in resolving obesity-induced inflammation and may inform therapeutic approaches to combat obesity and its complications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microvesicles Derived from Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Enhance Alveolar Type II Cell Proliferation and Attenuate Lung Inflammation in a Rat Model of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35795773/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is known that exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) alleviate hyperoxic lung injury of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in animal models, the role of microvesicles (MVs) derived from hUCMSCs in BPD is poorly defined. Furthermore, antenatal inflammation has been linked to high risk of BPD in preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to explore whether MVs derived from hUCMSCs can preserve lung structure and function in an antenatal lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced BPD rat model and to clarify the underlying mechanism. We demonstrate that antenatal LPS induced alveolar simplification, altered lung function, and dysregulated pulmonary vasculature, which restored by hUCMSCs and MVs treatment. Furthermore, MVs were large vesicles with a diameter of 100-900 nanometers and mostly uptaken by alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2) and macrophages. Compared with the LPS-exposed group, MVs restored the AT2 cell number and SP-C expression in vivo and promoted the proliferation of AT2 cells in vitro. MVs also restored the level of IL-6 and IL-10 in lung homogenate. Additionally, PTEN/AKT and MAPK pathways were associated with the protection of MVs. Taken together, this study suggests MVs derived from hUCMSCs improve lung architecture and function in an antenatal LPS-induced BPD rat model by promoting AT2 cell proliferation and attenuating lung inflammation; thus, MVs provide a promising therapeutic vehicle for BPD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Expression of DEL-1 in alveolar epithelial cells prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and eosinophil recruitment in acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expression of DEL-1 in alveolar epithelial cells is repressed in ALI mice;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEL-1 inhibits LPS-induced lung injury in mice;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEL-1 prevents eosinophil recruitment in LPS-induced mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infection is a major cause of acute lung injury (ALI). Developmental endothelial locus-1 (DEL-1) is an immunomodulatory mediator secreted by the endothelial cells. This study aimed to investigate the role of DEL-1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mouse models and its ability to regulate on eosinophil recruitment. Male C57BL/6 mice were administered an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated DEL-1 overexpression vector via intratracheal injection. Twenty-one days after vector instillation, mice were challenged with LPS (5 mg/kg body weight). Lung injury was evaluated using haematoxylin-eosin staining, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbnent assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses. DEL-1 was expressed in alveolar epithelial cells of mice. Compared with that in the control group, DEL-1 was expressed at low levels in the lungs of LPS-challenged mice. LPS injured the lungs in mice, as evidenced by an increase in alveolar wall thickness, inflammatory cell infiltration in the stroma, and alveolar collapse. AAV-mediated DEL-1 overexpression attenuated LPS-induced lung injury and inhibited the release of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. DEL-1 overexpression also attenuated LPS-induced oxidative stress by decreasing lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activities and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In addition, DEL-1 prevented eosinophil recruitment into lung tissues and inhibited eotaxin production. This study revealed the beneficial role of DEL-1 in preventing LPS-induced ALI in mice. Therefore, DEL-1 can protect lung tissues against LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and eosinophil recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UFL1 promotes antiviral immune response by maintaining STING stability independent of UFMylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35871231/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise regulation of STING homeostasis is essential for its antiviral function. Post-translational modification, especially ubiquitination, is important for the regulation of STING homeostasis. Previous studies have focused on how STING is degraded, but little is known about its maintenance. Here, we show that UFM1 specific ligase UFL1 promotes innate immune response by maintaining STING expression independent of UFMylation. Mechanistically, UFL1 inhibits TRIM29 to interact with STING, thereby reducing its ubiquitination at K338/K347/K370 and subsequent proteasomal degradation. DNA virus infection reduces the UFL1 expression, which may promote STING degradation and facilitate viral expansion. Our study identifies UFL1 as a crucial regulator for the maintenance of STING stability and antiviral function, and provides novel insights into the mechanistic explanation for the immunological escape of DNA virus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kir2.1-mediated membrane potential promotes nutrient acquisition and inflammation through regulation of nutrient transporters</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunometabolism contributes to inflammation, but how activated macrophages acquire extracellular nutrients to fuel inflammation is largely unknown. Here, we show that the plasma membrane potential (V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of macrophages mediated by Kir2.1, an inwardly-rectifying K+ channel, is an important determinant of nutrient acquisition and subsequent metabolic reprogramming promoting inflammation. In the absence of Kir2.1 activity, depolarized macrophage V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; lead to a caloric restriction state by limiting nutrient uptake and concomitant adaptations in nutrient conservation inducing autophagy, AMPK (Adenosine 5&amp;rsquo;-monophosphate-activated protein kinase), and GCN2 (General control nonderepressible 2), which subsequently depletes epigenetic substrates feeding histone methylation at loci of a cluster of metabolism-responsive inflammatory genes, thereby suppressing their transcription. Kir2.1-mediated V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; supports nutrient uptake by facilitating cell-surface retention of nutrient transporters such as 4F2hc and GLUT1 by its modulation of plasma membrane phospholipid dynamics. Pharmacological targeting of Kir2.1 alleviated inflammation triggered by LPS or bacterial infection in a sepsis model and sterile inflammation in human samples. These findings identify an ionic control of macrophage activation and advance our understanding of the immunomodulatory properties of V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; that links nutrient inputs to inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial cyclophilin D promotes disease tolerance by licensing NK cell development and IL-22 production against influenza virus</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitochondrial CypD is required to protect against severe influenza infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CypD expression promotes NK cell lymphopoiesis and maturation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NK cell-derived IL-22 enhances disease tolerance during influenza infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer of WT NK cells confers protection in &lt;em&gt;CypD&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice to influenza infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severity of pulmonary viral infections, including influenza A virus (IAV), is linked to excessive immunopathology, which impairs lung function. Thus, the same immune responses that limit viral replication can concomitantly cause lung damage that must be countered by largely uncharacterized disease tolerance mechanisms. Here, we show that mitochondrial cyclophilin D (CypD) protects against IAV via disease tolerance. &lt;em&gt;CypD&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice are significantly more susceptible to IAV infection despite comparable antiviral immunity. This susceptibility results from damage to the lung epithelial barrier caused by a reduction in interleukin-22 (IL-22)-producing natural killer (NK) cells. Transcriptomic and functional data reveal that &lt;em&gt;CypD&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; NK cells are immature and have altered cellular metabolism and impaired IL-22 production, correlating with dysregulated bone marrow lymphopoiesis. Administration of recombinant IL-22 or transfer of wild-type (WT) NK cells abrogates pulmonary damage and protects &lt;em&gt;CypD&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice after IAV infection. Collectively, these results demonstrate a key role for CypD in NK cell-mediated disease tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 conferred potent protection against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 inhibited M1 macrophage polarization, limiting its pro-inflammatory activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 suppressed NF-κB and STAT1 signaling by targeting IKKβ as well as STAT1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACT001 has been shown to exhibit excellent antitumor and anti-fibrosis activities. However, the role of ACT001 in acute lung injury (ALI) and the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of ACT001 on ALI and explore the potential mechanisms. Herein, we firstly established the ALI mouse model induced by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ACT001 treatment significantly alleviated histopathological changes of lung tissues with lower infiltration of pulmonary M1 macrophages in ALI mice. Then, we performed in vitro experiment and found that ACT001 treatment effectively inhibited the M1 phenotype of RAW264.7 and THP-1.. Next, we performed pull-down and mass spectrometry analysis to screen the interacting proteins of ACT001, identifying IKKβ and STAT1 as the critical target proteins of ACT001. And ACT001 treatment significantly suppressed the NF-κB and STAT1 pathways, thereby inhibiting the M1 polarization against inflammation in vivo and in vitro. Finally, we used IMD 0354 (IMD) and Fludarabine (Flud) to specifically block the activity of IKKβ and STAT1, and stimulated macrophages through IKKβ and STAT1 overexpression. Our data clearly showed that ACT001-induced decrease of the M1 polarization was blocked by IMD and Flud treatment, and reversed by IKKβ and STAT1 overexpression in RAW264.7 cells. In conclusion, we discovered that ACT001 significantly alleviates inflammation and limits M1 phenotype of pulmonary macrophages via suppressing NF-κB and STAT1 signaling pathways, providing new insights for the development of drugs to treat ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High phosphate-induced progressive proximal tubular injury is associated with the activation of Stat3/Kim-1 signaling pathway and macrophage recruitment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary phosphate intake in the Western population greatly exceeds the recommended dietary allowance and is linked to enhanced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It is unclear whether a chronic high phosphate diet (HPD) causes kidney injury in healthy individuals. Here, we show that feeding a 2% HPD in C57BL/6N mice for one up to six months resulted in hyperphosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia, increased plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) compared to mice on a 0.8% phosphate diet. Kidney injury was already noted after two months of HPD characterized by loss of proximal tubular (PT) cell polarity, flattened epithelia, disruption of brush border membranes, vacuolization, increased PT cell proliferation, marked interstitial mononuclear infiltration, and progressive accumulation of collagen fibers. HPD increased Stat3 activation and Kim-1 expression in PT epithelial cells and enhanced renal synthesis of chemokines recruiting monocytes and macrophages as well as macrophage related factors. Enhanced recruitment of F4/80+ macrophages around injured PT lesions was timely associated with increased Kim-1 synthesis, tubular MCP-1 expression, and degree of PT injury score. Likewise, tubulointerstitial fibrosis was associated with activation of Stat3/Kim-1 signaling pathway. The stimulation of human proximal tubular cells with high phosphate activated Stat3 signaling and induced HAVCR1 and CCL2 expression. We conclude that high phosphate results in progressive proximal tubular injury, indicating that high dietary phosphate intake may affect kidney health and therefore represents an underestimated health problem for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long non-coding RNA SNHG5 mediates periodontal inflammation through the NF-κB signalling pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the role of long non-coding RNAs and small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; A ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model was established, and gingival tissues were collected from patients with periodontitis and healthy controls. Inflammatory cytokines were detected using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analyses. Direct interactions between SNHG5 and p65 were detected by RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Micro-computed tomography, haematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemical staining were used to measure periodontal bone loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; SNHG5 expression was down-regulated in human and mouse periodontal tissues compared to that in the healthy controls. In vitro experiments demonstrated that SNHG5 significantly ameliorated tumour necrosis factor α-induced inflammation. Mechanistically, SNHG5 directly binds to the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 subunit and inhibits its translocation, thereby suppressing the NF-κB signalling pathway activation and reducing the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing three inflammasome expression. Locally injecting si-SNHG5 aggravated the periodontal destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study revealed that SNHG5 mediates periodontal inflammation through the NF-κB signalling pathway, providing a potential therapeutic target for periodontitis treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Lung Inflammation: Recent Advances and Emerging Techniques</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening lung injury characterized by an acute inflammatory response in the lung parenchyma. Hence, it is considered as the most appropriate clinical syndrome to study pathogenic mechanisms of lung inflammation. ARDS is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU), while no effective pharmacological treatment exists. It is very important therefore to fully characterize the underlying pathobiology and the related mechanisms, in order to develop novel therapeutic approaches. In vivo and in vitro models are important pre-clinical tools in biological and medical research in the mechanistic and pathological understanding of the majority of diseases. In this review, we will present data from selected experimental models of lung injury/acute lung inflammation, which have been based on clinical disorders that can lead to the development of ARDS and related inflammatory lung processes in humans, including ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI), sepsis, ischemia/reperfusion, smoke, acid aspiration, radiation, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), influenza, &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;S.&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; and coronaviruses infection. Data from the corresponding clinical conditions will also be presented. The mechanisms related to lung inflammation that will be covered are oxidative stress, neutrophil extracellular traps, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, surfactant, and water and ion channels. Finally, we will present a brief overview of emerging techniques in the field of omics research that have been applied to ARDS research, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, which may recognize factors to help stratify ICU patients at risk, predict their prognosis, and possibly, serve as more specific therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RG100204, A Novel Aquaporin-9 Inhibitor, Reduces Septic Cardiomyopathy and Multiple Organ Failure in Murine Sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35774785/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is caused by systemic infection and is a major health concern as it is the primary cause of death from infection. It is the leading cause of mortality worldwide and there are no specific effective treatments for sepsis. Gene deletion of the neutral solute channel Aquaporin 9 (AQP9) normalizes oxidative stress and improves survival in a bacterial endotoxin induced mouse model of sepsis. In this study we described the initial characterization and effects of a novel small molecule AQP9 inhibitor, RG100204, in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) induced model of polymicrobial infection. In vitro, RG100204 blocked mouse AQP9 H2O2 permeability in an ectopic CHO cell expression system and abolished the LPS induced increase in superoxide anion and nitric oxide in FaO hepatoma cells. Pre-treatment of CLP-mice with RG100204 (25 mg/kg p.o. before CLP and then again at 8 h after CLP) attenuated the hypothermia, cardiac dysfunction (systolic and diastolic), renal dysfunction and hepatocellular injury caused by CLP-induced sepsis. Post-treatment of CLP-mice with RG100204 also attenuated the cardiac dysfunction (systolic and diastolic), the renal dysfunction caused by CLP-induced sepsis, but did not significantly reduce the liver injury or hypothermia. The most striking finding was that oral administration of RG100204 as late as 3 h after the onset of polymicrobial sepsis attenuated the cardiac and renal dysfunction caused by severe sepsis. Immunoblot quantification demonstrated that RG100204 reduced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Moreover, myeloperoxidase activity in RG100204 treated lung tissue was reduced. Together these results indicate that AQP9 may be a novel drug target in polymicrobial sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fatal Circle of NETs and NET-Associated DAMPs Contributing to Organ Dysfunction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens or sterile injuries. Pattern recognition receptors (PRR) sense molecules released from inflamed or damaged cells, or foreign molecules resulting from invading pathogens. PRRs can in turn induce inflammatory responses, comprising the generation of cytokines or chemokines, which further induce immune cell recruitment. Neutrophils represent an essential factor in the early immune response and fulfill numerous tasks to fight infection or heal injuries. The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is part of it and was originally attributed to the capture and elimination of pathogens. In the last decade studies revealed a detrimental role of NETs during several diseases, often correlated with an exaggerated immune response. Overwhelming inflammation in single organs can induce remote organ damage, thereby further perpetuating release of inflammatory molecules. Here, we review recent findings regarding damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which are able to induce NET formation, as well as NET components known to act as DAMPs, generating a putative fatal circle of inflammation contributing to organ damage and sequentially occurring remote organ injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular Vesicle/Macrophage Axis: Potential Targets for Inflammatory Disease Intervention</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35769456/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can regulate the polarization of macrophages in a variety of inflammatory diseases by mediating intercellular signal transduction and affecting the occurrence and development of diseases. After macrophages are regulated by EVs, they mainly show two phenotypes: the proinflammatory M1 type and the anti-inflammatory M2 type. A large number of studies have shown that in diseases such as mastitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Acute lung injury, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, EVs promote the progression of the disease by inducing the M1-like polarization of macrophages. In diseases such as liver injury, asthma, and myocardial infarction, EVs can induce M2-like polarization of macrophages, inhibit the inflammatory response, and reduce the severity of the disease, thus indicating new pathways for treating inflammatory diseases. The EV/macrophage axis has become a potential target for inflammatory disease pathogenesis and comprehensive treatment. This article reviews the structure and function of the EV/macrophage axis and summarizes its biological functions in inflammatory diseases to provide insights for the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Innate Immune Cell Death in Neuroinflammation and Alzheimer&#39;s Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35741014/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder molecularly characterized by the formation of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and type 2 microtubule-associated protein (Tau) abnormalities. Multiple studies have shown that many of the brain&amp;rsquo;s immunological cells, specifically microglia and astrocytes, are involved in AD pathogenesis. Cells of the innate immune system play an essential role in eliminating pathogens but also regulate brain homeostasis and AD. When activated, innate immune cells can cause programmed cell death through multiple pathways, including pyroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis, and PANoptosis. The cell death often results in the release of proinflammatory cytokines that propagate the innate immune response and can eliminate Aβ plaques and aggregated Tau proteins. However, chronic neuroinflammation, which can result from cell death, has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and can worsen AD. Therefore, the innate immune response must be tightly balanced to appropriately clear these AD-related structural abnormalities without inducing chronic neuroinflammation. In this review, we discuss neuroinflammation, innate immune responses, inflammatory cell death pathways, and cytokine secretion as they relate to AD. Therapeutic strategies targeting these innate immune cell death mechanisms will be critical to consider for future preventive or palliative treatments for AD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electronic cigarette vapor exposure exaggerates the pro-inflammatory response during influenza A viral infection in human distal airway epithelium</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic cigarettes or vaping products have been marketed as a safer alternative to smoking, but very little is known about the health effects in the human lung, particularly in the distal airways, a key site of airway obstruction and destruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is often exacerbated by viral infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of electronic cigarette vapor (e-vapor) on human distal airway epithelial responses to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We isolated primary small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) from donor lungs free of lung disease, and cultured them at air-liquid interface (ALI). To measure markers of epithelial injury such as integrity of epithelial barrier structure and function, we selected a regimen of non-toxic, barrier preserving e-vapor exposure of cultured cells to 15 puffs of e-vapor from a commercially available e-cigarette once per day for 3 days, prior to IAV infection. After 72 h of infection, media and cell lysates were collected to measure cytokines involved in inflammatory and antiviral responses. Pre-exposure to e-vapor with IAV infection, compared to IAV infection alone, significantly increased inflammatory and antiviral mediators including IL-8, CXCL10, IFN-beta, and MX1. Our results suggest that e-vapor exposure amplifies human distal airway pro-inflammatory response to IAV infection, independently of the severity of cell injury during viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loss of MMR and TGFBR2 Increases the Susceptibility to Microbiota-Dependent Inflammation-Associated Colon Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35688320/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes are causative in Lynch syndrome and a significant proportion of sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs). MMR-deficient (dMMR) CRCs display increased mutation rates, with mutations frequently accumulating at short repetitive DNA sequences throughout the genome (microsatellite instability). The TGFBR2 gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in dMMR CRCs. Therefore, we generated an animal model to study how the loss of both TGFBR2 signaling impacts dMMR-driven intestinal tumorigenesis in vivo and explore the impact of the gut microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We generated VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice in which Msh2loxP and Tgfbr2loxP alleles are inactivated by Villin-Cre recombinase in the intestinal epithelium. VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice were analyzed for their rate of intestinal cancer development and for the mutational spectra and gene expression profiles of tumors. In addition, we assessed the impact of chemically induced chronic inflammation and gut microbiota composition on colorectal tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice developed small intestinal adenocarcinomas and CRCs with histopathological features highly similar to CRCs in Lynch syndrome patients. The CRCs in VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice were associated with the presence of colitis and displayed genetic and histological features that resembled inflammation-associated CRCs in human patients. The development of CRCs in VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice was strongly modulated by the gut microbiota composition, which in turn was impacted by the TGFBR2 status of the tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results demonstrate a synergistic interaction between MMR and TGFBR2 inactivation in inflammation-associated colon tumorigenesis and highlight the crucial impact of the gut microbiota on modulating the incidence of inflammation-associated CRCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CaMK4 Promotes Acute Lung Injury Through NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation in Type II Alveolar Epithelial Cell</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35734175/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Type II alveolar epithelial cell (AEC II), in addition to its roles in maintaining lung homeostasis, takes an active role in inflammatory response during acute lung injury (ALI). Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK4) activated by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin signaling, has been implicated in immune responses. This study was to investigate the roles of CaMK4 in the development of ALI and the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; CaMK4 inhibitor KN-93 was used to investigate the effects of CaMK4 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The effects of KN-93 on disease development of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI were also evaluated. The role of CaMK4 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation was explored in human AEC II cell line A549 using KN-93 or CaMK4 siRNA. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was measured by histology immunofluorescence and Western blot. IL-1β and IL-18 were measured by ELISA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Phosphorylation of CaMK4 and the expression of NLRP3 and Caspase-1 p20 were increased in the lungs of LPS-induced ALI mice, which was suppressed by KN-93 as measured by Western blot. Further, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was detected in AEC II from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and LPS-induced ALI mice. In vitro, inhibition or silencing CaMK4 in AEC II significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, resulting in reduced IL-1β production. The inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and decreased IL-1β/IL-18 production by KN-93 led to reduced inflammatory infiltration and ameliorated lung injury in LPS-induced ALI mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; CaMK4 controls the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in AEC II during LPS-induced ALI. CaMK4 inhibition could be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving the chances of curing patients with cancer who have had surgery to remove metastatic sites of disease is a priority area for cancer research. &lt;em&gt;Pexa-Vec&lt;/em&gt; (Pexastimogene Devacirepvec; JX-594, TG6006) is a principally immunotherapeutic oncolytic virus that has reached late-phase clinical trials. We report the results of a single-center, nonrandomized biological end point study (trial registration: EudraCT number 2012-000704-15), which builds on the success of the presurgical intravenous delivery of oncolytic viruses to tumors. Nine patients with either colorectal cancer liver metastases or metastatic melanoma were treated with a single intravenous infusion of &lt;em&gt;Pexa-Vec&lt;/em&gt; ahead of planned surgical resection of the metastases. Grade 3 and 4 &lt;em&gt;Pexa-Vec&lt;/em&gt;-associated side effects were lymphopaenia and neutropaenia. &lt;em&gt;Pexa-Vec&lt;/em&gt; was peripherally carried in plasma and was not associated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Upon surgical resection, &lt;em&gt;Pexa-Vec&lt;/em&gt; was found in the majority of analyzed tumors. &lt;em&gt;Pexa-Vec&lt;/em&gt; therapy associated with IFNα secretion, chemokine induction, and resulted in transient innate and long-lived adaptive anticancer immunity. In the 2 patients with significant and complete tumor necrosis, a reduction in the peripheral T-cell receptor diversity was observed at the time of surgery. These results support the development of presurgical oncolytic vaccinia virus-based therapies to stimulate anticancer immunity and increase the chances to cure patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Citraconate inhibits ACOD1 (IRG1) catalysis, reduces interferon responses and oxidative stress, and modulates inflammation and cell metabolism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35655026/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the immunomodulatory and cytoprotective properties of itaconate have been studied extensively, it is not known whether its naturally occurring isomers mesaconate and citraconate have similar properties. Here, we show that itaconate is partially converted to mesaconate intracellularly and that mesaconate accumulation in macrophage activation depends on prior itaconate synthesis. When added to human cells in supraphysiological concentrations, all three isomers reduce lactate levels, whereas itaconate is the strongest succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibitor. In cells infected with influenza A virus (IAV), all three isomers profoundly alter amino acid metabolism, modulate cytokine/chemokine release and reduce interferon signalling, oxidative stress and the release of viral particles. Of the three isomers, citraconate is the strongest electrophile and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) agonist. Only citraconate inhibits catalysis of itaconate by cis-aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1), probably by competitive binding to the substrate-binding site. These results reveal mesaconate and citraconate as immunomodulatory, anti-oxidative and antiviral compounds, and citraconate as the first naturally occurring ACOD1 inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Implications of Hyperoxia over the Tumor Microenvironment: An Overview Highlighting the Importance of the Immune System</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35681719/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperoxia is used in order to counteract hypoxia effects in the TME (tumor microenvironment), which are described to boost the malignant tumor phenotype and poor prognosis. The reduction of tumor hypoxic state through the formation of a non-aberrant vasculature or an increase in the toxicity of the therapeutic agent improves the efficacy of therapies such as chemotherapy. Radiotherapy efficacy has also improved, where apoptotic mechanisms seem to be implicated. Moreover, hyperoxia increases the antitumor immunity through diverse pathways, leading to an immunopermissive TME. Although hyperoxia is an approved treatment for preventing and treating hypoxemia, it has harmful side-effects. Prolonged exposure to high oxygen levels may cause acute lung injury, characterized by an exacerbated immune response, and the destruction of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Furthermore, under this situation, the high concentration of ROS may cause toxicity that will lead not only to cell death but also to an increase in chemoattractant and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. This would end in a lung leukocyte recruitment and, therefore, lung damage. Moreover, unregulated inflammation causes different consequences promoting tumor development and metastasis. This process is known as protumor inflammation, where different cell types and molecules are implicated; for instance, IL-1β has been described as a key cytokine. Although current results show benefits over cancer therapies using hyperoxia, further studies need to be conducted, not only to improve tumor regression, but also to prevent its collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intraarticularly injectable silk hydrogel microspheres with enhanced mechanical and structural stability to attenuate osteoarthritis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A silk fibroin (silk) hydrogel was prepared by using diglycidyl ether (BDDE), a chemical crosslinker commonly used to generate Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved hyaluronic acid (HA) medical products. The silk/BDDE hydrogels exhibited high elasticity (compressive modulus of 166 ± 15.0 kPa), anti-fatigue properties, and stable structure and mechanical strength in aqueous solution. Chemical crosslinking was conducted in a high concentration (9.3 M) of lithium bromide (LiBr) solution, a salt that is commonly used to dissolve degummed silk fibers during silk solubilization. The unfolded and extended structure of silk molecules with these reaction conditions, as well as the unique ionic environment provided by LiBr facilitated a high degree of crosslinking in the hydrogel. Similar hydrogels were not obtained when the silk was dissolved in other silk fiber-dissolving reagents (——, Ajisawa&amp;rsquo;s, formic acid (FA)/LiBr, FA/CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solutions), likely because partially folded silk structures and the ionic conditions with these reagents were less favorable for the crosslinking reaction. Based on these findings, silk/BDDE hydrogel spheres were prepared using an oil/water (o/w) emulsification method and biocompatibility and biodegradation were evaluated in vivo, along with other silk gel control systems (e.g., enzyme-catalyzed di-tyrosine and pulverized silk/BDDE gel particles with irregular shapes). Histological and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that the silk/BDDE hydrogel spheres were biocompatible and served as a bio-lubricant to treat osteoarthritis (OA). The intra-articular injection of the gel spheres reduced pain as measured with OA rats, reduced cartilage damage and resisted the digestive environment in the articular cavity for extended time frames (&amp;gt;4 weeks), suggesting utility for pain relief and sustained drug release for future OA treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polyphenols-Rich Fraction from Annona muricata Linn. Leaves Attenuates Oxidative and Inflammatory Responses in Neutrophils, Macrophages, and Experimental Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annona muricata&lt;/em&gt; Linn. is a common plant found in the warmest regions of South and Central America and its use in traditional medicine has been reported for the treatment of various illnesses. In the current study, we investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of crude extract and fractions from &lt;em&gt;A. muricata&lt;/em&gt; L. leaves in isolated murine phagocytic immune cells as well as experimental LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI). In a luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assay, we showed that ethyl acetate (EtOAc.f) and n-butanol (BuOH.f) fractions-both rich in polyphenols-reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils stimulated with opsonized zymosan; similar results were found in culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). By evaluating anti-inflammatory activity in BMDMs, EtOAc.f and BuOH.f reduced secretion of IL-6 and expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD40. Furthermore, in LPS-induced ALI, oral administration of EtOAc.f reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissue. In addition, on a mechanism dependent on glutathione levels, the oxidative damage was also attenuated. These findings revealed direct antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of polyphenols-rich fractions of &lt;em&gt;A. muricata&lt;/em&gt; L. leaves on neutrophils and macrophages. Moreover, the reduced oxidative damage and levels of inflammatory markers in experimental ALI suggest that these fractions might be explored for the development of new therapies for inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Caloric restriction reduces the pro-inflammatory eicosanoid 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid to protect from acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35654224/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury is a frequent complication in the clinical setting and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Preconditioning with short-term caloric restriction is highly protective against kidney injury in rodent ischemia reperfusion injury models. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown hampering clinical translation. Here, we examined the molecular basis of caloric restriction-mediated protection to elucidate the principles of kidney stress resistance. Analysis of an RNAseq dataset after caloric restriction identified Cyp4a12a, a cytochrome exclusively expressed in male mice, to be strongly downregulated after caloric restriction. Kidney ischemia reperfusion injury robustly induced acute kidney injury in male mice and this damage could be markedly attenuated by pretreatment with caloric restriction. In females, damage was significantly less pronounced and preconditioning with caloric restriction had only little effect. Tissue concentrations of the metabolic product of Cyp4a12a, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), were found to be significantly reduced by caloric restriction. Conversely, intraperitoneal supplementation of 20-HETE in preconditioned males partly abrogated the protective potential of caloric restriction. Interestingly, this effect was accompanied by a partial reversal of caloric restriction&amp;ndash;induced changes in protein but not RNA expression pointing towards inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress and lipid metabolism. Thus, our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying kidney protection by caloric restriction. Hence, understanding the mediators of preconditioning is an important prerequisite for moving towards translation to the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long-term hepatitis B virus infection of rhesus macaques requires suppression of host immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35637225/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B virus has infected a third of the world&amp;rsquo;s population, and 296 million people are living with chronic infection. Chronic infection leads to progressive liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure, and there remains no reliable curative therapy. These gaps in our understanding are due, in large part, to a paucity of animal models of HBV infection. Here, we show that rhesus macaques regularly clear acute HBV infection, similar to adult humans, but can develop long-term infection if immunosuppressed. Similar to patients, we longitudinally detected HBV DNA, HBV surface antigen, and HBV e antigen in the serum of experimentally infected animals. In addition, we discovered hallmarks of HBV infection in the liver, including RNA transcription, HBV core and HBV surface antigen translation, and covalently closed circular DNA biogenesis. This pre-clinical animal model will serve to accelerate emerging HBV curative therapies into the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is an active catechin in green tea and has multiple biological functions, such as anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, and immune regulation. This work aimed to study the protective function of EGCG against asthma and the mechanism. Asthma in mice was induced by house dust mite (HDM) challenge. EGCG treatment alleviated tissue injury, inflammation, mucus production and collagen deposition, and it reduced M2 macrophage infiltration in mouse lung tissues induced by HDM. The bioinformatics analyses in this study suggested that target genes of EGCG were enriched in the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway, EGCG treatment targeted HIF-1α and thereby suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) activation. Adenovirus (AAV) overexpression vectors of HIF-1α and VEGFA were administrated into mice after EGCG treatment. Either restoration of HIF-1α or VEGFA significantly blocked the protective functions of EGCG treatment against HDM-induced allergic asthma. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that EGCG treatment relieves asthmatic symptoms in mice by suppressing HIF-1α/VEGFA-mediated M2 skewing of macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nuclear antiviral innate responses at the intersection of DNA sensing and DNA repair</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coevolution of vertebrate and mammalian hosts with DNA viruses has driven the ability of host cells to distinguish viral from cellular DNA in the nucleus to induce intrinsic immune responses. Concomitant viral mechanisms have arisen to inhibit DNA sensing. At this virus-host interface, emerging evidence links cytokine responses and cellular homeostasis pathways, particularly the DNA damage response (DDR). Nuclear DNA sensors, such as the interferon (IFN)-γ inducible protein 16 (IFI16), functionally intersect with the DDR regulators ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Here, we discuss accumulating knowledge for the DDR-innate immunity signaling axis. Through the lens of this infection-driven signaling axis, we present host and viral molecular strategies acquired to regulate autoinflammation and antiviral responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activated Drp1 regulates p62-mediated autophagic flux and aggravates inflammation in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion via the ROS-RIP1/RIP3-exosome axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35624495/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) refers to a secondary brain injury that can occur when the blood supply to the ischemic brain tissue is restored. However, the mechanism underlying such injury remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The 150 male C57 mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h and reperfusion for 24 h, Among them, 50 MCAO mice were further treated with Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1) and 50 MCAO mice were further treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in a low-glucose culture medium for 4 h under hypoxic conditions and then transferred to normal conditions for 12 h. Then, cerebral blood flow, mitochondrial structure, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagic flux, aggresome and exosome expression profiles, cardiac tissue structure, mitochondrial length and cristae density, mtDNA and ROS content, as well as the expression of Drp1-Ser616/Drp1, RIP1/RIP3, LC3 II/LC3 I, TNF-α, IL-1β, etc., were detected under normal or Drp1 interference conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The mtDNA content, ROS levels, and Drp1-Ser616/Drp1 were elevated by 2.2, 1.7 and 2.7 times after CIRI (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). However, the high cytoplasmic LC3 II/I ratio and increased aggregation of p62 could be reversed by 44% and 88% by Drp1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The low fluorescence intensity of autophagic flux and the increased phosphorylation of RIP3 induced by CIRI could be attenuated by ROS scavenger, NAC (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). RIP1/RIP3 inhibitor Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) restored 75% to a low LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and enhanced 2 times to a high RFP-LC3 after Drp1 activation (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, although CIRI-induced ROS production caused no considerable accumulation of autophagosomes (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05), it increased the packaging and extracellular secretion of exosomes containing p62 by 4 - 5 times, which could be decreased by Mdivi-1, Drp1 shRNA, and Nec-1 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, TNF-α and IL-1β increased in CIRI-derived exosomes could increase RIP3 phosphorylation in normal or oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) conditions (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; CIRI activated Drp1 and accelerated the p62-mediated formation of autophagosomes while inhibiting the transition of autophagosomes to autolysosomes via the RIP1/RIP3 pathway activation. Undegraded autophagosomes were secreted extracellularly in the form of exosomes, leading to inflammatory cascades that further damaged mitochondria, resulting in excessive ROS generation and the blockage of autophagosome degradation, triggering a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxemia is a defining feature of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an often-fatal complication of pulmonary or systemic inflammation, yet the resulting tissue hypoxia, and its impact on immune responses, is often neglected. In the present study, we have shown that ARDS patients were hypoxemic and monocytopenic within the first 48 h of ventilation. Monocytopenia was also observed in mouse models of hypoxic acute lung injury, in which hypoxemia drove the suppression of type I interferon signaling in the bone marrow. This impaired monopoiesis resulted in reduced accumulation of monocyte-derived macrophages and enhanced neutrophil-mediated inflammation in the lung. Administration of colony-stimulating factor 1 in mice with hypoxic lung injury rescued the monocytopenia, altered the phenotype of circulating monocytes, increased monocyte-derived macrophages in the lung and limited injury. Thus, tissue hypoxia altered the dynamics of the immune response to the detriment of the host and interventions to address the aberrant response offer new therapeutic strategies for ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Down-regulated miR-146a expression with increased neutrophil extracellular traps and apoptosis formation in autoimmune-mediated diffuse alveolar hemorrhage</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028828/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Increasing evidences have suggested an important role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating cell death processes including NETosis and apoptosis. Dysregulated expression of miRNAs and increased formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and apoptosis participate in autoimmune-mediated diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), mostly associated with pulmonary capillaritis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. In particular, besides the inhibition of apoptosis, miR-146a can control innate and acquired immune responses, and regulate the toll-like receptor pathway through targeting TRAF6 to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines like IL-8, a NETosis inducer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Expression of miR-146a, TRAF6 and NETs were examined in peripheral blood neutrophils (PBNs) and lung tissues from SLE-associated DAH patients, and in neutrophils and pristane-induced DAH lung tissues from C57BL/6 mice. To assess NETs formation, we examined NETosis-related DNAs morphology and crucial mediators including protein arginine deiminase 4 and citrullinated Histone 3. Expression of miR-146a and its endogenous RNA SNHG16 were studied in HL-60 promyelocytic cells and MLE-12 alveolar cells during NETosis and apoptosis processes, respectively. MiR-146a-overexpressed and CRISPR-Cas13d-mediated SNHG16-silenced HL-60 cells were investigated for NETosis. MiR-146a-overexpressed MLE-12 cells were analyzed for apoptosis. Pristane-injected mice received intra-pulmonary miR-146a delivery to evaluate therapeutic efficacy in DAH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In DAH patients, there were down-regulated miR-146a levels with increased TRAF6 expression and PMA/LPS-induced NETosis in PBNs, and down-regulated miR-146a levels with increased TRAF6, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), IL-8, NETs and apoptosis expression in lung tissues. HMGB1-stimulated mouse neutrophils had down-regulated miR-146a levels with increased TRAF6, IL-8 and NETs expression. PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells had down-regulated miR-146a levels with enhanced NETosis. MiR-146a-overexpressed or SNHG16-silenced HL-60 cells showed reduced NETosis. Apoptotic MLE-12 cells had down-regulated miR-146a expression and increased HMGB1 release, while miR-146a-overexpressed MLE-12 cells showed reduced apoptosis and HMGB1 production. There were down-regulated miR-146a levels with increased TRAF6, HMGB1, IL-8, NETs and apoptosis expression in mouse DAH lung tissues. Intra-pulmonary miR-146a delivery could suppress DAH by reducing TRAF6, IL-8, NETs and apoptosis expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results demonstrate firstly down-regulated pulmonary miR-146a levels with increased TRAF6 and IL-8 expression and NETs and apoptosis formation in autoimmune-mediated DAH, and implicate a therapeutic potential of intra-pulmonary miR-146a delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stat3/IL-6 signaling mediates sustained pneumonia induced by Agiostrongylus cantonensis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35617354/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angiostrongylus cantonensis (AC) is well-documented that parasitizes the host brain and causes eosinophilic meningitis. The migration route of AC in permissive hosts is well demonstrated, while in nonpermissive hosts, it remains to be fully defined. In the present study, we exploited live imaging technology, morphological and pathological configuration analysis, and molecular biological technologies to explore the migration route of AC and the accompanying tissue damage in nonpermissive and permissive hosts. Our data indicated that, in nonpermissive host mouse, AC larvae migrated from intestinal wall to liver at 2 hours post-infection (hpi), from liver to lung at 4 hpi and then from lung to brain at 8 hpi. AC larval migration caused fatal lung injury (pneumonia) during acute and early infection phases, along with significant activation of Stat3/IL-6 signaling. In addition, AC induce sustained interstitial pneumonia in mouse and rat and pulmonary fibrosis only in rat during late infection phase. Moreover, during the early and late infection phases, Th2 cytokine expression and Stat3 and IL-6 signaling were persistently enhanced and myeloid macrophage cells were notably enriched in host lung, and administration of Stat3 and IL-6 inhibitors (C188-9 and LMT-28) attenuated AC infection-induced acute pneumonia in mice. Overall, we are the first to provide direct and systemic laboratory evidence of AC migration route in a nonpermissive host and report that infection with a high dose of AC larvae could result in acute and fatal pneumonia through Stat3/IL-6 signaling in mice. These findings may present a feasible to rational strategy to minimize the pathogenesis induced by AC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interleukin-33 (IL-33): A critical review of its biology and the mechanisms involved in its release as a potent extracellular cytokine</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35640416/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion of the biology of the alarmin cytokine IL-33, a member of the IL-1 family with critical roles in type 2 and type 1 immunity and regulatory responses, and allergic and non-allergic inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review of the expression of IL-33 in tissue-derived cells (endothelial cells, epithelial cells and stromal cells), its rapid release upon tissue injury or cellular damage, and its processing into highly active forms by inflammatory and allergen proteases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion of the problems of specificity of IL-33 reagents, critical review of the recent literature and highlights of results validated using IL-33-deficient cells as controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendations for generating reliable results by including appropriate specificity controls early in a project in each experimental system and model analyzed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review of the genetic and environmental regulation of IL-33 in asthma, and results of clinical trials with anti-IL-33 antibodies for therapy of asthma and COPD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a member of the IL-1 family, is an alarmin cytokine with crucial roles in tissue homeostasis and repair, type 2 immunity, allergic and non-allergic inflammation, viral infection, and cancer. IL-33 is abundant in the nuclei of tissue-derived cells, including endothelial cells from blood vessels, epithelial cells from barrier tissues, and fibroblastic stromal cells from various tissues. IL-33 is released upon cell damage or tissue injury and activates Myd88-dependent signaling pathways in cells expressing the ST2 (IL-1RL1) receptor. Analysis of patient samples and studies in murine models support an important role of IL-33/ST2 signaling in allergic inflammation in different tissues (lung, nasopharynx, skin) and diseases (asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis). IL33 and IL1RL1/ST2 are among the most highly replicated susceptibility loci for asthma. However, the IL-33/ST2 pathway is also important in non-allergic inflammation. Indeed, targets of IL-33 include immune cells involved in both type 2 and type 1 immunity and regulatory responses, such as group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), mast cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), Th2 cells, basophils, eosinophils, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, Th1 cells, CD8 T cells, NK and iNKT cells. In the main part of this review, we discuss the basic biology of the IL-33 protein (molecular characteristics, nuclear localization, cellular sources in vivo), and its mechanisms of release, and bioactive forms in various contexts. Importantly, we alert the scientific community to the problems of specificity of IL-33 reagents, we explain why studies without specificity controls with IL-33-deficient cells are misleading to the field and lead to unnecessary controversy, and we make recommendations to generate reliable results. In the final part, we review the genetic and environmental regulation of IL-33 in allergic airway inflammation and asthma, and we highlight recent studies showing clinical efficacy of anti-IL-33 antibodies in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-Oleoyl dopamine induces IL-10 via central nervous system TRPV1 and improves endotoxemia and sepsis outcomes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35610647/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35610647/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) participates in thermosensation and inflammatory pain, but its immunomodulatory mechanisms remain enigmatic. N-Oleoyl dopamine (OLDA), an endovanilloid and endocannabinoid, is a TRPV1 agonist that is produced in the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. We studied the anti-inflammatory effects and TRPV1-dependent mechanisms of OLDA in models of inflammation and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mice were challenged intratracheally or intravenously with LPS, or intratracheally with S. aureus to induce pneumonia and sepsis, and then were treated intravenously with OLDA. Endpoints included plasma cytokines, leukocyte activation marker expression, mouse sepsis scores, lung histopathology, and bacterial counts. The role of TRPV1 in the effects of OLDA was determined using Trpv1-/- mice, and mice with TRPV1 knockdown pan-neuronally, in peripheral nervous system neurons, or in myeloid cells. Circulating monocytes/macrophages were depleted using clodronate to determine their role in the anti-inflammatory effects of OLDA in endotoxemic mice. Levels of exogenous OLDA, and of endovanilloids and endocannabinoids, at baseline and in endotoxemic mice, were determined by LC-MS/MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; OLDA administration caused an early anti-inflammatory response in endotoxemic and septic mice with high serum levels of IL-10 and decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. OLDA also reduced lung injury and improved mouse sepsis scores. Blood and lung bacterial counts were comparable between OLDA- and carrier-treated mice with S. aureus pneumonia. OLDA&amp;rsquo;s effects were reversed in mice with pan-neuronal TRPV1 knockdown, but not with TRPV1 knockdown in peripheral nervous system neurons or myeloid cells. Depletion of monocytes/macrophages reversed the IL-10 upregulation by OLDA in endotoxemic mice. Brain and blood levels of endovanilloids and endocannabinoids were increased in endotoxemic mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; OLDA has strong anti-inflammatory actions in mice with endotoxemia or S. aureus pneumonia. Prior studies focused on the role of peripheral nervous system TRPV1 in modulating inflammation and pneumonia. Our results suggest that TRPV1-expressing central nervous system neurons also regulate inflammatory responses to endotoxemia and infection. Our study reveals a neuro-immune reflex that during acute inflammation is engaged proximally by OLDA acting on neuronal TRPV1, and through a multicellular network that requires circulating monocytes/macrophages, leads to the systemic production of IL-10.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sophoridine inhibits endotoxin-induced acute lung injury by enhancing autophagy of macrophage and reducing inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35603481/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, which can lead to respiratory distress syndrome and cause patient death. In this study, we sought to determine the role of sophoridine, a compound purified from sophora, in ALI. A mouse model of ALI was established by treating mice with LPS through nonexposed tracheal instillation. After LPS-induced mice were treated with sophoridine, LPS-induced alveolar wall thickening, alveolar interstitial inflammatory exudation and thickening, and the degree of pulmonary edema were found to be inhibited. Macrophages play an important role in inflammation, and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that sophoridine reduces the LPS-induced expression of inflammatory factors by macrophages, suggesting that sophoridine may inhibit lung inflammation in LPS-treated mice through reduces the secretion of inflammatory factors. Further, treatment with sophoridine up-regulated autophagy in macrophage cells in vitro and mouse lung tissues in vivo. LPS can bind to TLRs and activate the MyD88/NF-κB pathways, leading to increased inflammation in the pathogenesis of ALI. Our findings revealed that sophoridine down-regulated the expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and mTOR mRNA and protein in mouse pulmonary tissue. Collectively, these findings indicate that sophoridine may inhibit LPS-induced ALI by enhancing autophagy of macrophages and reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apelin/APJ system in inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apelin is widely distributed in the central nervous system and diverse organs in human and animals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The apelin/APJ system has important anti-inflammatory effects and is involved in regulating inflammation-related diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apelin-APJ signaling could inhibit inflammation, oxidative stress and ameliorate CNS and organ injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apelin/APJ system might become a novel promising therapeutic target for various diseases through anti-inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apelin, an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor (APJ), is widely distributed within the central nervous system and diverse organs in human and animals. Recent studies indicate that the apelin/APJ system plays an important role in physiological and pathophysiological situations. Apelin/APJ could inhibit inflammatory response by down-regulation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and by up-regulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathway etc. Basic and preliminary research demonstrated that apelin/APJ system was involved in multiple diseases such as cardiovascular system diseases, liver and kidney diseases, neurological diseases, inflammatory intestinal diseases, pancreatitis, lung injury, aging, and obesity. Further, deficiency or overabundance of apelin can aggravate disease states in that inflammation is not only an important physiologic defense mechanism but also a potential mediator of organ damage. In this review, we summarize recent apelin/APJ system research progress with emphasis on the influence of the system on inflammation. Further, the mechanistic basis by which apelin regulates various inflammation-related diseases is analyzed. Finally, apelin and APJ might be presented as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of diseases mediated or exacerbated by inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Caspase-4/11 exacerbates disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection by promoting inflammation and immunothrombosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35588457/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the discovery of fundamental roles for the noncanonical inflammasome molecule Caspase-4/11 in promoting pathological inflammatory and prothrombotic pathways in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV-2) infections. Our work demonstrates that Caspase-11 has a broader role in immune responses beyond its previously appreciated effects in bacterial infections. Further, we show that Caspase-11–deficient mice infected with SARS–CoV-2 fare significantly better in terms of overall illness, lung inflammation, and thrombosis than wild-type (WT) mice, thus implicating Caspase-11 as a new therapeutic target for preventing or treating COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV-2) is a worldwide health concern, and new treatment strategies are needed. Targeting inflammatory innate immunity pathways holds therapeutic promise, but effective molecular targets remain elusive. Here, we show that human caspase-4 (CASP4) and its mouse homolog, caspase-11 (CASP11), are up-regulated in SARS–CoV-2 infections and that CASP4 expression correlates with severity of SARS–CoV-2 infection in humans. SARS–CoV-2–infected &lt;em&gt;Casp11&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice were protected from severe weight loss and lung pathology, including blood vessel damage, compared to wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking the caspase downstream effector gasdermin-D (&lt;em&gt;Gsdmd&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). Notably, viral titers were similar regardless of CASP11 knockout. Global transcriptomics of SARS–CoV-2–infected WT, &lt;em&gt;Casp11&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gsdmd&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lungs identified restrained expression of inflammatory molecules and altered neutrophil gene signatures in &lt;em&gt;Casp11&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. We confirmed that protein levels of inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and CXCL1, as well as neutrophil functions, were reduced in &lt;em&gt;Casp11&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lungs. Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Casp11&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lungs accumulated less von Willebrand factor, a marker for endothelial damage, but expressed more Kruppel-Like Factor 2, a transcription factor that maintains vascular integrity. Overall, our results demonstrate that CASP4/11 promotes detrimental SARS–CoV-2–induced inflammation and coagulopathy, largely independently of GSDMD, identifying CASP4/11 as a promising drug target for treatment and prevention of severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Characterization of Immunopathology and Small Airway Remodeling in Constrictive Bronchiolitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35550018/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35550018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Constrictive bronchiolitis (ConB) is a relatively rare and understudied form of lung disease whose underlying immunopathology remains incompletely defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; Our objectives were to quantify specific pathological features that differentiate ConB from other diseases that affect the small airways and to investigate the underlying immune and inflammatory phenotype present in ConB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We performed a comparative histomorphometric analysis of small airways in lung biopsy samples collected from 50 soldiers with postdeployment ConB, 8 patients with sporadic ConB, 55 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 25 nondiseased control subjects. We measured immune and inflammatory gene expression in lung tissue using the NanoString nCounter Immunology Panel from six control subjects, six soldiers with ConB, and six patients with sporadic ConB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with control subjects, we found shared pathological changes in small airways from soldiers with postdeployment ConB and patients with sporadic ConB, including increased thickness of the smooth muscle layer, increased collagen deposition in the subepithelium, and lymphocyte infiltration. Using principal-component analysis, we showed that ConB pathology was clearly separable both from control lungs and from small airway disease associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. NanoString gene expression analysis from lung tissue revealed T-cell activation in both groups of patients with ConB with upregulation of proinflammatory pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB) signaling, TLR (Toll-like receptor) signaling, T-cell receptor signaling, and antigen processing and presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings indicate shared immunopathology among different forms of ConB and suggest that an ongoing T-helper cell type 1-type adaptive immune response underlies airway wall remodeling in ConB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ZBP1-dependent inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, and cytokine storm disrupt IFN therapeutic efficacy during coronavirus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35587515/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35587515/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZBP1 fans the flames of cytokine storm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferons (IFNs) provide robust innate immune protection against β-coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 when available soon after infection. Paradoxically, therapeutic use of type I IFNs in patients with severe COVID-19 may promote increased pathology and clinical deterioration. Using a mouse model of respiratory β-coronavirus infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Karki et al. found that the detrimental effects of type I IFNs in later stages of infection were related to IFN-induced expression of ZBP1, an innate immune sensor also capable of inducing PANoptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death. Mice lacking ZBP1 were protected from IFN-induced lethality in the MHV infection model. These findings suggest that ZBP1 could be targeted therapeutically in severe COVID-19 to ward off deleterious effects of type I IFNs including cytokine storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), continues to cause substantial morbidity and mortality in the ongoing global pandemic. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms that govern innate immune and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Whereas interferon (IFN)-based therapies are generally expected to be beneficial during viral infection, clinical trials in COVID-19 have shown limited efficacy and potential detrimental effects of IFN treatment during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this failure remain unknown. In this study, we found that IFN induced Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1)-mediated inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in human and murine macrophages and in the lungs of mice infected with β-coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). In patients with COVID-19, expression of the innate immune sensor &lt;em&gt;ZBP1&lt;/em&gt; was increased in immune cells from those who succumbed to the disease compared with those who recovered, further suggesting a link between ZBP1 and pathology. In mice, IFN-β treatment after β-coronavirus infection increased lethality, and genetic deletion of &lt;em&gt;Zbp1&lt;/em&gt; or its Zα domain suppressed cell death and protected the mice from IFN-mediated lethality during β-coronavirus infection. Overall, our results identify that ZBP1 induced during coronavirus infection limits the efficacy of IFN therapy by driving inflammatory cell death and lethality. Therefore, inhibiting ZBP1 activity may improve the efficacy of IFN therapy, paving the way for the development of new and critically needed therapeutics for COVID-19 as well as other infections and inflammatory conditions where IFN-mediated cell death and pathology occur.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Combinational benefit of antihistamines and remdesivir for reducing SARS-CoV-2 replication and alleviating inflammation-induced lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35503561/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the combination of anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapy is predicted to provide clinical benefits. We recently demonstrated that mast cells (MCs) are an essential mediator of SARS-CoV-2-initiated hyperinflammation. We also showed that spike protein-induced MC degranulation initiates alveolar epithelial inflammation for barrier disruption and suggested an off-label use of antihistamines as MC stabilizers to block degranulation and consequently suppress inflammation and prevent lung injury. In this study, we emphasized the essential role of MCs in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung lesions in vivo, and demonstrated the benefits of co-administration of antihistamines and antiviral drug remdesivir in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-induced MC degranulation resulted in alveolar-capillary injury, while pretreatment of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells with antihistamines prevented adhesion junction disruption; predictably, the combination of antiviral drug remdesivir with the antihistamine loratadine, a histamine receptor 1 (HR1) antagonist, dampened viral replication and inflammation, thereby greatly reducing lung injury. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of MCs in SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and lung injury and provide a feasible combination antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapy for COVID-19 treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evolving Concepts in Endothelial Pathobiology of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35582968/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a deadly disease, characterized by increased vascular resistance, pulmonary arteriolar loss, and occlusive arterial remodeling, leading to eventual right heart failure. Evidence increasingly points to the pulmonary endothelium as a central actor in PAH. Endothelial cell apoptosis can result directly in distal lung arteriolar pruning and indirectly in the formation of complex and occlusive arterial lesions, reflecting an imbalance between endothelial injury and repair in the development and progression of PAH. Many of the mutations implicated in PAH are in genes, which are predominantly, or solely, expressed in endothelial cells, and the endothelium is a major target for therapeutic interventions to restore BMP signaling. We explore how arterial pruning can promote the emergence of occlusive arterial remodeling mediated by ongoing endothelial injury secondary to hemodynamic perturbation and pathological increases in luminal shear stress. The emerging role of endothelial cell senescence is discussed in the transition from reversible to irreversible arterial remodeling in advanced PAH, and we review the sometimes conflicting evidence that female sex hormones can both protect or promote vascular changes in disease. Finally, we explore the contribution of the endothelium to metabolic changes and the altered inflammatory and immune state in the PAH lung, focusing on the role of excessive TGFβ signaling. Given the complexity of the endothelial pathobiology of PAH, we anticipate that emerging technologies that allow the study of molecular events at a single cell level will provide answers to many of the questions raised in this review.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NADPH oxidase family proteins: signaling dynamics to disease management</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35585127/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are pervasive signaling molecules in biological systems. In humans, a lack of ROS causes chronic and extreme bacterial infections, while uncontrolled release of these factors causes pathologies due to excessive inflammation. Professional phagocytes such as neutrophils (PMNs), eosinophils, monocytes, and macrophages use superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase (NOX) as part of their arsenal of antimicrobial mechanisms to produce high levels of ROS. NOX is a multisubunit enzyme complex composed of five essential subunits, two of which are localized in the membrane, while three are localized in the cytosol. In resting phagocytes, the oxidase complex is unassembled and inactive; however, it becomes activated after cytosolic components translocate to the membrane and are assembled into a functional oxidase. The NOX isoforms play a variety of roles in cellular differentiation, development, proliferation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal control, migration, and contraction. Recent studies have identified NOX as a major contributor to disease pathologies, resulting in a shift in focus on inhibiting the formation of potentially harmful free radicals. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and the transduction pathways involved in NOX-mediated signaling is essential for the development of new therapeutic agents that minimize the hyperproduction of ROS. The current review provides a thorough overview of the various NOX enzymes and their roles in disease pathophysiology, highlights pharmacological strategies, and discusses the importance of computational modeling for future NOX-related studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Involvement of Alarmins in the Pathogenesis of Sjögren’s Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35628481/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sjögren&amp;rsquo;s syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects exocrine glands, primarily the salivary and lachrymal glands. It is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the glandular tissues, ultimately leading to their dysfunction and destruction. Besides classic dry eyes and dry mouth defined as sicca syndrome, patients affected by the disease also typically display symptoms such as fatigue, pain and in more than 50% of cases, systemic manifestations such as arthritis, interstitial lung involvement, neurological involvement and an increased risk of lymphoma. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SS still remain elusive. The crucial role of innate immunity has been advocated in recent years regarding the pathogenesis of pSS, especially in the initiation and progression toward autoimmunity. Alarmins are endogenous molecules that belong to the large family of damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Alarmins are rapidly released, ensuing cell injury and interacting with pattern recognition receptors (PRR) such as toll-like receptors (TLR) to recruit and activate cells of the innate immune system and to promote adaptive immunity responses. This review highlights the current knowledge of various alarmins and their role in the pathogenesis of pSS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mucus sialylation determines intestinal host-commensal homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35303419/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A local sialyltransferase dominantly controls intestinal protein sialylation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sialylation protects intestinal mucus integrity from bacterial degradation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mucus sialylation is critical for commensalism and bacterial metabolite homeostasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treatment with sialylated mucins ameliorates gut inflammation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intestinal mucus forms the first line of defense against bacterial invasion while providing nutrition to support microbial symbiosis. How the host controls mucus barrier integrity and commensalism is unclear. We show that terminal sialylation of glycans on intestinal mucus by ST6GALNAC1 (ST6), the dominant sialyltransferase specifically expressed in goblet cells and induced by microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns, is essential for mucus integrity and protecting against excessive bacterial proteolytic degradation. Glycoproteomic profiling and biochemical analysis of ST6 mutations identified in patients show that decreased sialylation causes defective mucus proteins and congenital inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mice harboring a patient ST6 mutation have compromised mucus barriers, dysbiosis, and susceptibility to intestinal inflammation. Based on our understanding of the ST6 regulatory network, we show that treatment with sialylated mucin or a Foxo3 inhibitor can ameliorate IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-acetylcysteine alleviates fine particulate matter (PM2.5)-induced lung injury by attenuation of ROS-mediated recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6Chigh monocytes and lung inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35594827/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure to PM2.5 could induce the generation of oxidative stress in the lung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 elicited the recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes to lung alveoli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure to PM2.5 induced lung injury and the production of inflammatory proteins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N-acetylcysteine attenuated PM2.5-induced ROS production and lung inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced ROS generation attenuated neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes recruitment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Exposure to particulate matter (PM) may contribute to lung inflammation and injury. The therapeutic effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a well-known antioxidant, with regards to the prevention and treatment of fine PM (PM2.5)-induced lung injury is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the effect of PM2.5 on the recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes into lung alveoli and the production of proinflammatory proteins by stimulating the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and to investigate the therapeutic effect of NAC on PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a single administration of PM2.5 (200 μg/100 μl/mouse) or phosphate-buffered saline (control) via intratracheal instillation. The mice were injected intratracheally via a microsprayer aerosolizer with NAC (20 or 40 mg/kg) 1 h before PM2.5 instillation and 24 h after PM2.5 instillation. Total protein, VEGF, IL-6, and TNF-α in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured. Oxidative stress was evaluated by determining levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite in BALF. Flow cytometric analysis was used to identify and quantify neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; and Ly6C&lt;sub&gt;low&lt;/sub&gt; monocyte subsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Neutrophil count, total protein, and VEGF content in BALF significantly increased after PM2.5 exposure and reached the highest level on day 2. Increased levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, nitrite, and MDA in BALF were also noted. Flow cytometric analysis showed increased recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;, but not Ly6C&lt;sub&gt;low&lt;/sub&gt; monocytes, into lung alveoli. Treatment with NAC via the intratracheal spray significantly attenuated the recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes into lung alveoli in PM2.5-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, NAC significantly attenuated the production of total protein, VEGF, nitrite, and MDA in the mice with PM2.5-induced lung injury in a dose-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; PM2.5-induced lung injury caused by the generation of oxidative stress led to the recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes, and production of inflammatory proteins. NAC treatment alleviated PM2.5-induced lung injury by attenuating the ROS-mediated recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes and lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel small molecule Hsp90 inhibitor, C-316-1, attenuates acute kidney injury by suppressing RIPK1-mediated inflammation and necroptosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is marked by a fast deterioration of the kidney function that may be caused by a variety of factors and there is still no effective treatment for AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A novel small molecule Hsp90 inhibitor, C-316-1, prevented necroptosis and inflammation in cisplatin- and ischemia/reperfusion-induced in vitro and in vivo via binding with R46, E47 and S50 in Cdc37 binding site of Hsp90.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C-316-1 is a novel Hsp90 inhibitor with high efficiency in treatment of AKI and Hsp90 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is marked by a fast deterioration of the kidney function that may be caused by a variety of factors. Recently, although our group found that PPBICA alleviated programmed cell death in AKI, poor water solubility limited its bioavailability. In this research, we screened a series of derivatives and found that C-316-1 had the best suppressive effect on preventing necroptosis and inflammation in cisplatin- and ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI in vitro and in vivo with lower toxicity and better water solubility. Mass spectrometry results showed that C-316-1 bound to heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), which was further confirmed by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance. Additionally, the Hsp90 expression was upregulated in the blood and tissues of AKI patients. We discovered that C-316-1 decreased the RIPK1 protein level without affecting its mRNA expression. The proteasome inhibitor, MG132 restored the level of RIPK1 reduced by C-316-1, suggesting that C-316-1 limits necroptosis by promoting the degradation of RIPK1 rather than by reducing its production. Immunoprecipitation further showed that pretreatment with C-316-1 disrupted the Hsp90-Cdc37 protein-protein Interactions (PPIs). Thereby, C-316-1 inhibited the Hsp90-Cdc37 complex formation and led to a significant decrease in RIPK1, which in turn reduced necroptosis. Moreover, C-316-1 treatment did not protect against kidney injury in vivo and in vitro when Hsp90 was knocked down and R46, E47, and S50 in Cdc37 binding site of Hsp90 might form an important active pocket with C-316-1. These findings suggest that C-316-1 is a potential therapeutic agent against RIPK1-Mediated Necroptosis in AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEAD/H-box proteins are the largest family of RNA helicases in mammalian genomes, and they are present in all kingdoms of life. Since their discovery in the late 1980s, DEAD/H-box family proteins have been a major focus of study. They have been found to play central roles in RNA metabolism, gene expression, signal transduction, programmed cell death, and the immune response to bacterial and viral infections. Aberrant functions of DEAD/H-box proteins have been implicated in a wide range of human diseases that include cancer, neurodegeneration, and inherited genetic disorders. In this review, we provide a historical context and discuss the molecular functions of DEAD/H-box proteins, highlighting the recent discoveries linking their dysregulation to human diseases. We will also discuss the state of knowledge regarding two specific DEAD/H-box proteins that have critical roles in immune responses and programmed cell death, DDX3X and DDX58, also known as RIG-I. Given their importance in homeostasis and disease, an improved understanding of DEAD/H-box protein biology and protein-protein interactions will be critical for informing strategies to counteract the pathogenesis associated with several human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive accumulation of hepatic lipids and metabolic stress-induced liver injury. There are currently no approved effective pharmacological treatments for NAFLD. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for centuries to treat patients with chronic liver diseases without clear disease types and mechanisms. More recently, TCM has been shown to have unique advantages in the treatment of NAFLD. We performed a systematic review of the medical literature published over the last two decades and found that many TCM formulas have been reported to be beneficial for the treatment of metabolic dysfunctions, including &lt;em&gt;Potentilla discolor&lt;/em&gt; Bunge (PDB). PDB has a variety of active compounds, including flavonoids, terpenoids, organic acids, steroids and tannins. Many compounds have been shown to exhibit a series of beneficial effects for the treatment of NAFLD, including anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory functions, improvement of lipid metabolism and reversal of insulin resistance. In this review, we summarize potential therapeutic effects of TCM formulas for the treatment of NAFLD, focusing on the medicinal properties of natural active compounds from PDB and their underlying mechanisms. We point out that PDB can be classified as a novel candidate for the treatment and prevention of NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antagonistic Effect of Selenium on Fumonisin B1 Promotes Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Formation in Chicken Neutrophils</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils are an important component of the innate immune system, and one of their defense mechanisms, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), is a hot topic of the current research. This study explored the effects of fumonisin B1 (FB1) on chicken neutrophil production of NETs and its possible molecular mechanism of action. Scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy were used to observe morphological changes in neutrophils, and a fluorescence microplate reader was used to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) and extracellular DNA release from neutrophils. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot were used to determine the expression levels of selenoproteins. The results indicate that FB1 inhibited the zymosan-induced formation of NETs in chicken neutrophils by preventing ROS burst and histone H3 (H3) and neutrophil elastase (NE) release. Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD), and deiodinase (DIO) were downregulated in the FB1 group. The protein expression levels of GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, DIO3, and TXNRD1 were consistent with the changes in their gene expressions, suggesting an abnormal selenoprotein expression in response to the toxic effects of FB1. Conversely, selenium (Se) supplementation reduced the toxic effects of FB1 and restored the NETs formation, indicating that Se can be used as a potential drug to prevent and control FB1 toxicity in livestock farming.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myeloid CCR2 Promotes Atherosclerosis after AKI</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35537780/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The risk of cardiovascular events rises after AKI. Leukocytes promote atherosclerotic plaque growth and instability. We established a model of enhanced remote atherosclerosis after renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and investigated the underlying inflammatory mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Atherosclerotic lesions and inflammation were investigated in native and bone marrow-transplanted LDL receptor-deficient (&lt;em&gt;LDLr&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice after unilateral renal IR injury using histology, flow cytometry, and gene expression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Aortic root atherosclerotic lesions were significantly larger after renal IR injury than in controls. A gene expression screen revealed enrichment for chemokines and their cognate receptors in aortas of IR-injured mice in early atherosclerosis, and of T cell-associated genes in advanced disease. Confocal microscopy revealed increased aortic macrophage proximity to T cells. Differential aortic inflammatory gene regulation in IR-injured mice largely paralleled the pattern in the injured kidney. Single-cell analysis identified renal cell types that produced soluble mediators upregulated in the atherosclerotic aorta. The analysis revealed a marked early increase in &lt;em&gt;Ccl2&lt;/em&gt;, which CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; myeloid cells mainly expressed. CCR2 mediated myeloid cell homing to the post-ischemic kidney in a cell-individual manner. Reconstitution with &lt;em&gt;Ccr2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; bone marrow dampened renal post-ischemic inflammation, reduced aortic &lt;em&gt;Ccl2&lt;/em&gt; and inflammatory macrophage marker CD11c, and abrogated excess aortic atherosclerotic plaque formation after renal IR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our data introduce an experimental model of remote proatherogenic effects of renal IR and delineate myeloid CCR2 signaling as a mechanistic requirement. Monocytes should be considered as mobile mediators when addressing systemic vascular sequelae of kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myeloid Poldip2 Contributes to the Development of Pulmonary Inflammation by Regulating Neutrophil Adhesion in a Murine Model of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35535614/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Lung injury, a severe adverse outcome of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome, is attributed to excessive neutrophil recruitment and effector response. Poldip2 (polymerase δ-interacting protein 2) plays a critical role in regulating endothelial permeability and leukocyte recruitment in acute inflammation. Thus, we hypothesized that &lt;em&gt;myeloid&lt;/em&gt; Poldip2 is involved in neutrophil recruitment to inflamed lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and Results:&lt;/em&gt; After characterizing myeloid-specific &lt;em&gt;Poldip2&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice, we showed that at 18 hours post-lipopolysaccharide injection, bronchoalveolar lavage from myeloid Poldip2-deficient mice contained fewer inflammatory cells (8 [4-16] versus 29 [12-57]×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/mL in wild-type mice) and a smaller percentage of neutrophils (30% [28%-34%] versus 38% [33%-41%] in wild-type mice), while the main chemoattractants for neutrophils remained unaffected. In vitro, Poldip2-deficient neutrophils responded as well as wild-type neutrophils to inflammatory stimuli with respect to neutrophil extracellular trap formation, reactive oxygen species production, and induction of cytokines. However, neutrophil adherence to a tumor necrosis factor-α stimulated endothelial monolayer was inhibited by Poldip2 depletion (225 [115-272] wild-type [myePoldip2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;] versus 133 [62-178] myeloid-specific &lt;em&gt;Poldip2&lt;/em&gt; knockout [myePoldip2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;] neutrophils) as was transmigration (1.7 [1.3-2.1] versus 1.1 [1.0-1.4] relative to baseline transmigration). To determine the underlying mechanism, we examined the surface expression of β2-integrin, its binding to soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and Pyk2 phosphorylation. Surface expression of β2-integrins was not affected by Poldip2 deletion, whereas β2-integrins and Pyk2 were less activated in Poldip2-deficient neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These results suggest that myeloid Poldip2 is involved in β2-integrin activation during the inflammatory response, which in turn mediates neutrophil-to-endothelium adhesion in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The gut microbiota prime systemic antiviral immunity via the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35545033/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppression of gut microbiota renders mice susceptible to systemic viral infections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gut microbiota drive systemic antiviral immunity via IFN-I priming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbiota-driven IFN-I priming involves the cGAS-STING axis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbiota mediate systemic IFN-I priming via DNA-containing membrane vesicles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbiota are vital for immune homeostasis and provide a competitive barrier to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Here, we investigated how gut commensals modulate systemic immunity and response to viral infection. Antibiotic suppression of the gut microbiota reduced systemic tonic type I interferon (IFN-I) and antiviral priming. The microbiota-driven tonic IFN-I-response was dependent on cGAS-STING but not on TLR signaling or direct host-bacteria interactions. Instead, membrane vesicles (MVs) from extracellular bacteria activated the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis by delivering bacterial DNA into distal host cells. DNA-containing MVs from the gut microbiota were found in circulation and promoted the clearance of both DNA (herpes simplex virus type 1) and RNA (vesicular stomatitis virus) viruses in a cGAS-dependent manner. In summary, this study establishes an important role for the microbiota in peripheral cGAS-STING activation, which promotes host resistance to systemic viral infections. Moreover, it uncovers an underappreciated risk of antibiotic use during viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of CD4&#43; T Cell-Derived Cannabinoid Receptor 2 Signaling Exacerbates Sepsis via Inhibiting IL-10</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35534212/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35534212/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is a receptor mainly expressed in immune cells and believed to be immunosuppressive in infective or inflammatory models. However, its role in sepsis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we delineate the function and mechanism of CB2 in the cecal ligation and puncture-induced septic model in mice. The activation of CB2 signaling with HU308 led to decreased survival rates and more severe lung injury in septic mice, and lower IL-10 levels in peritoneal lavage fluid were observed in the CB2 agonist group. The mice with conditional knockout of CB2-encoding gene CNR2 in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells (CD4 Cre CNR2&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;) improved survival, enhanced IL-10 production, and ameliorated pulmonary damage in the sepsis model after CB2 activation. In addition, double-knockout of the CNR2 gene (Lyz2 Cre CD4 Cre CNR2&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;) decreased the susceptibility to sepsis compared with Lyz2 Cre CNR2&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Mechanistically, the blockade of IL-10 with the anti-IL-10 Ab abolished its protection in CD4 Cre CNR2&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt; mice. In accordance with the animal study, in vitro results revealed that the lack of CNR2 in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells elevated IL-10 production, and CB2 activation inhibited CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell-derived IL-10 production. Furthermore, in the clinical environment, septic patients expressed enhanced CB2 mRNA levels compared with healthy donors in PBMCs, and their CB2 expression was inversely correlated with IL-10. These results suggested that the activation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell-derived CB2 increased susceptibility to sepsis through inhibiting IL-10 production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Canonical and noncanonical regulatory roles for JAK2 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35522243/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) are two fibrotic interstitial lung diseases that share the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) injury pattern. Here, we report that RNA sequencing of lung biopsies from patients with RA-ILD and IPF revealed shared and distinct disease-causing pathways. Analysis of transcriptomic data identified a JAK2 related JAK/STAT signaling pathway gene signature that distinguishes RA-UIP from idiopathic UIP. This was further confirmed by immunohistostaining, which identified JAK2 phosphorylation with two distinct forms of activation: a cytoplasmic form of JAK2 activation in most IPF cases (13/20) and a nuclear form of p-JAK2 in RA-UIP (5/5) and a minority of IPF (6/20) cases. Further immunohistostaining identified STAT5A&amp;amp;B as the downstream transcriptional activator for JAK2-mediated canonical signal transduction and phosphorylation of Tyr41 on histone H3 (H3Y41ph) as the downstream epigenetic regulation site for JAK2-mediated noncanonical signal transduction. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the RNA-Seq data further supported this shared pathogenic mechanism for the two diseases with the enrichment of STAT5A&amp;amp;B target gene sets as well as the JAK2 regulated H3Y41ph target gene set. This regulatory role of JAK2 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis was further demonstrated by the attenuation of bleomycin-induced murine pulmonary fibrosis using a JAK2-selective pharmacological inhibitor CEP33779. In vitro studies with normal and IPF derived lung fibroblasts revealed a central role for JAK2 as an essential intermediary molecule in TGF-β-mediated myofibroblast trans-differentiation, proliferation, and extracellular matrix protein production. These observations support a crucial role for JAK2 as an intermediary molecule in fibrotic lung disease development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clinical implications of tristetraprolin (TTP) modulation in the treatment of inflammatory diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35525391/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abnormal regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine mediators can contribute to the excess inflammation characteristic of many autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease, type 1 diabetes, and many others. The tristetraprolin (TTP) family consists of a small group of related RNA-binding proteins that bind to preferred AU-rich binding sites within the 3&amp;rsquo;-untranslated regions of specific mRNAs to promote mRNA deadenylation and decay. TTP deficient mice develop a severe systemic inflammatory syndrome consisting of arthritis, myeloid hyperplasia, dermatitis, autoimmunity and cachexia, due at least in part to the excess accumulation of proinflammatory chemokine and cytokine mRNAs and their encoded proteins. To investigate the possibility that increased TTP expression or activity might have a beneficial effect on inflammatory diseases, at least two mouse models have been developed that provide proof of principle that increasing TTP activity can promote the decay of pro-inflammatory and other relevant transcripts, and decrease the severity of mouse models of inflammatory disease. Animal studies of this type are summarized here, and we briefly review the prospects for harnessing these insights for the development of TTP-based anti-inflammatory treatments in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of lung endothelial cells identifies dynamic inflammatory and regenerative subpopulations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have demonstrated the phenotypic heterogeneity of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) within a vascular bed; however, little is known about how distinct endothelial subpopulations in a particular organ respond to an inflammatory stimulus. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq of 35,973 lung ECs obtained during baseline as well as postinjury time points after inflammatory lung injury induced by LPS. Seurat clustering and gene expression pathway analysis identified 2 major subpopulations in the lung microvascular endothelium, a subpopulation enriched for expression of immune response genes such as MHC genes (immuneEC) and another defined by increased expression of vascular development genes such as Sox17 (devEC). The presence of immuneEC and devEC subpopulations was also observed in nonhuman primate lungs infected with SARS-CoV-2 and murine lungs infected with H1N1 influenza virus. After the peak of inflammatory injury, we observed the emergence of a proliferative lung EC subpopulation. Overexpression of Sox17 prevented inflammatory activation in ECs. Thus, there appeared to be a &amp;ldquo;division of labor&amp;rdquo; within the lung microvascular endothelium in which some ECs showed propensity for inflammatory signaling and others for endothelial regeneration. These results provide underpinnings for the development of targeted therapies to limit inflammatory lung injury and promote regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Few studies reported the therapeutic effect of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) in lung inflammatory diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory role and underlying molecular in cadmium-induced lung injury have been poorly understood, directly linked to chronic lung diseases (CLDs): chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer etc. Therefore, in this study we aim to investigate the therapeutic activities of water extract of KRG (KRG-WE) in mouse cadmium-induced lung injury model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Method:&lt;/em&gt; The anti-inflammatory roles and underlying mechanisms of KRG-WE were evaluated in vitro under cadmium-stimulated lung epithelial cells (A549) and HEK293T cell line and in vivo in cadmium-induced lung injury mouse model using semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), luciferase assay, immunoblotting, and FACS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; KRG-WE strongly ameliorated the symptoms of CdSO4-induced lung injury in mice according to total cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and severity scores as well as cytokine levels. KRG-WE significantly suppressed the upregulation of inflammatory signaling comprising mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and their upstream enzymes. In in vitro study, KRG-WE suppressed expression of interleukin (IL)-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and IL-8 while promoting recovery in CdSO4-treated A549 cells. Similarly, KRG-WE reduced phosphorylation of MAPK and c-Jun/c-Fos in cadmium-exposed A549 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; KRG-WE was found to attenuate symptoms of cadmium-induced lung injury and reduce the expression of inflammatory genes by suppression of MAPK/AP-1-mediated pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is the main cause of death in intensive care unit. Maladaptive cytokine storm and T-cell lymphopenia are critical prognosis predictors of sepsis. Electroacupuncture (EA) is expected to be an effective intervention to prevent sepsis. This study aims to determine the potential of EA at ST36 (Zusanli) to prevent experimental septic mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mice were randomly assigned into PBS, LPS, or EA+LPS group. EA (0.1 mA, continuous wave, 10 Hz) was performed stimulating the ST36 for 30 min, once a day for 3 days. After the third day, all mice were challenged with PBS or LPS (4 mg/kg) simultaneously. Mice were evaluated for survival, ear temperature, and other clinical symptoms. Lung and small intestine tissue injuries were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Bio-Plex cytokine assay was used to analyze the concentration of cytokines. T lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry and Western blot assays. The role of T cells in preventing sepsis by EA was analyzed by using nude mice lacking T lymphocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; EA at ST36 improved survival, symptom scores, and ear temperature of endotoxemic mice. EA also improved dramatically pulmonary and intestinal injury by over 50% as compared to untreated mice. EA blunted the inflammatory cytokine storm by inducing a lasting inhibition of the production of major inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, eotaxin, IFN-γ, MIP-1β and KC). Flow cytometry and Western blot analyses showed EA significantly reduced T-lymphocyte apoptosis and pyroptosis. Furthermore, T lymphocytes were critical for the effects of EA at ST36 stimulation blunted serum TNF-α levels in wild-type but not in nude mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; EA halted systemic inflammation and improved survival in endotoxemic mice. These effects are associated with the protective effect of EA on T lymphocytes, and T cells are required in the anti-inflammatory effects of EA in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hydnocarpin D attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via MAPK/NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35537248/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a complex pulmonary destructive disease with limited therapeutic approaches. Hydnocarpin D (HD) is a flavonolignan isolated from Hydnocarpus wightiana which possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether HD has beneficial effects on ALI as well as its underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study evaluated the protective effect of HD in ALI and the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, the role of HD on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice was tested by determination of neutrophil infiltration, levels of inflammatory cytokines, lung histology and edema, vascular and alveolar barrier disruption. In vitro, murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms RESULTS: Administration of HD protected mice against LPS-induced ALI, including ameliorating the histological alterations in the lung tissues, and decreasing lung edema, protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, infiltration of inflammatory cell and secretion of cytokines. Moreover, HD blocked the phosphorylation of TLR-4, NF-κB, and ERK in LPS-induced lung injury. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, HD inhibited LPS-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells, which largely depend upon the upregulation of antioxidant defensive Nrf2 pathway, thereby suppressing LPS-activated proinflammatory mediator secretion, NLRP3 inflammasome, and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; HD attenuates oxidative stress and inflammation against LPS-induced ALI via MAPK/NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, and is a promising novel therapeutic candidate for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influenza A virus NS1 protein hijacks YAP/TAZ to suppress TLR3-mediated innate immune response</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35503798/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hippo signaling pathway, which is historically considered as a dominator of organ development and homeostasis has recently been implicated as an immune regulator. However, its role in host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) has not been widely investigated. Here, we found that IAV could activate the Hippo effectors Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) through physical binding of the IAV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) with C-terminal domain of YAP/TAZ, facilitating their nuclear location. Meanwhile, YAP/TAZ downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral cytokines against IAV infection, therefore benefiting virus replication and host cell apoptosis. A mouse model of IAV infection further demonstrated Yap deficiency protected mice against IAV infection, relieving lung injury. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ blocked anti-viral innate immune signaling via downregulation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) expression. YAP directly bound to the putative TEADs binding site on the promoter region of TLR3. The elimination of acetylated histone H3 occupancy in the TLR3 promoter resulted in its transcriptional silence. Moreover, treatment of Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor or disruption of HDAC4/6 reversed the inhibition of TLR3 expression by YAP/TAZ, suggesting HDAC4/6 mediated the suppression function of YAP/TAZ. Taken together, we uncovered a novel immunomodulatory mechanism employed by IAV, where YAP/TAZ antagonize TLR3-mediated innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MARCH8 attenuates cGAS-mediated innate immune responses through ubiquitylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35503863/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) binds to microbial and self-DNA in the cytosol and synthesizes cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and downstream mediators to elicit an innate immune response. Regulation of cGAS activity is essential for immune homeostasis. Here, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 (also known as MARCHF8, c-MIR, and RNF178) as a negative regulator of cGAS-mediated signaling. The immune response to double-stranded DNA was attenuated by overexpression of MARCH8 and enhanced by knockdown or knockout of MARCH8. MARCH8 interacted with the enzymatically active core of cGAS through its conserved RING-CH domain and catalyzed the lysine-63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitylation of cGAS at Lys411. This polyubiquitylation event inhibited the DNA binding ability of cGAS, impaired cGAMP production, and attenuated the downstream innate immune response. Furthermore, March8-deficient mice were less susceptible than their wild-type counterparts to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. Together, our findings reveal a mechanism underlying the functional regulation of cGAS and the fine-tuning of the innate immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pirfenidone ameliorates early pulmonary fibrosis in LPS-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome by inhibiting endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition via the Hedgehog signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35504205/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pirfenidone(PFD) treatment can inhibit the progress of pulmonary fibrosis and notably reduce the mortality of ARDS mice in early stage of ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PFD reduces early pulmonary fibrosis stimulated by LPS, which is related to the inhibition of EndMT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PFD may ameliorate LPS-induced ARDS by regulating the HH signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary vascular endothelial dysfunction is a key pathogenic mechanism in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in fibrosis in lung tissues, including in the context of COVID-19. Pirfenidone (PFD) has become a novel therapeutic agent for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and can improve lung function, inhibit fibrosis and inhibit inflammation. Recently, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) was shown to play a crucial role in various respiratory diseases. However, the role of PFD in the course of EndMT in LPS-induced ARDS remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the anti-EndMT effects of PFD on pulmonary fibrosis after LPS-induced ARDS. First, we determined that PFD significantly reduced LPS-induced ARDS, as shown by significant pathological alterations, and alleviated the oxidative stress and inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, PFD decreased pulmonary fibrosis in LPS-induced ARDS by inhibiting EndMT and reduced the expression levels of Hedgehog (HH) pathway target genes, such as Gli1 and α-SMA, after LPS induction. In summary, this study confirmed that inhibiting the HH pathway by PFD could decrease pulmonary fibrosis by downregulating EndMT in LPS-induced ARDS. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PFD is a promising agent to attenuate pulmonary fibrosis following ARDS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UDP/P2Y6 contributes to enhancing LPS-induced acute lung injury by regulating neutrophil migration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35567855/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils play a prominent role in the inflammatory response and are a critical factor in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). Despite a deep understanding of neutrophil accumulation in the pulmonary microvasculature during the process of this disease, the regulatory mechanism of neutrophil recruitment remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the functions and signaling pathways of the purinergic receptor P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in mediating the innate immune response in ALI. P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-deficient mice, bone marrow chimeras, and neutrophilic chimeras were created in this work to explore the function of P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in ALI. The results indicated that the extracellular nucleotide UDP was released as a dangerous signal and activated P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to promote the inflammatory response and pulmonary damage during the process of ALI. P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency may mitigate deterioration of this disease, including reduced ALI-related inflammatory factor release and immune cell invasion. Bone marrow and neutrophil chimeras and adoptive transfer in mice showed that P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; expression on neutrophils contributed to neutrophil infiltration into lung tissues induced by UDP. Further work indicated that P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; was involved in the neutrophil migration capability through the ErK signaling pathway by mediating the deformation of F-actin filaments and pseudopodia formation during cell recruitment to pulmonary tissue. Here, we provide evidence for the mechanism by which the purinergic receptor P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; contributes to ALI development by regulating neutrophil infiltration into lung tissues. These data indicated that P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this acute severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&#39;s All in the PAN: Crosstalk, Plasticity, Redundancies, Switches, and Interconnectedness Encompassed by PANoptosis Underlying the Totality of Cell Death-Associated Biological Effects</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35563804/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against cellular perturbations. Innate immune activation elicits inflammatory programmed cell death in response to microbial infections or alterations in cellular homeostasis. Among the most well-characterized programmed cell death pathways are pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. While these pathways have historically been defined as segregated and independent processes, mounting evidence shows significant crosstalk among them. These molecular interactions have been described as &amp;lsquo;crosstalk&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;plasticity&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;redundancies&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;molecular switches&amp;rsquo;, and more. Here, we discuss the key components of cell death pathways and note several examples of crosstalk. We then explain how the diverse descriptions of crosstalk throughout the literature can be interpreted through the lens of an integrated inflammatory cell death concept, PANoptosis. The totality of biological effects in PANoptosis cannot be individually accounted for by pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis alone. We also discuss PANoptosomes, which are multifaceted macromolecular complexes that regulate PANoptosis. We consider the evidence for PANoptosis, which has been mechanistically characterized during influenza A virus, herpes simplex virus 1, Francisella novicida, and Yersinia infections, as well as in response to altered cellular homeostasis, in inflammatory diseases, and in cancers. We further discuss the role of IRF1 as an upstream regulator of PANoptosis and conclude by reexamining historical studies which lend credence to the PANoptosis concept. Cell death has been shown to play a critical role in infections, inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and more; therefore, having a holistic understanding of cell death is important for identifying new therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TLR2/caspase-5/Panx1 pathway mediates necrosis-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages during acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35473933/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by necroinflammation formed by necrotic tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and interstitial inflammation. In necroinflammation, macrophages are key inflammatory cells and can be activated and polarized into proinflammatory macrophages. Membranous Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can cooperate with intracellular NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) to recognize danger signals from necrotic TECs and activate proinflammatory macrophages by assembling NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the cooperation between TLRs and NLRP3 is still unclear. Using conditioned medium from necrotic TECs, we confirmed that necrotic TECs could release danger signals to activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. We further identified that necrotic TECs-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation was dependent on ATP secretion via Pannexin-1 (Panx1) channel in macrophages. Next, we verified that TLR2 was required for the activation of Panx1 and NLRP3 in macrophages. Mechanistically, we indicated that caspase-5 mediated TLR2-induced Panx1 activation. In addition, we showed that necrotic TECs-induced activation of TLR2/caspase-5/Panx1 axis could be decreased in macrophages when TECs was protected by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Overall, we demonstrate that danger signals from necrotic TECs could activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages via TLR2/caspase-5/Panx1 axis during AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liproxstatin-1 alleviates LPS/IL-13-induced bronchial epithelial cell injury and neutrophilic asthma in mice by inhibiting ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35483233/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corrigendum to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576922009675&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liproxstatin-1 alleviates LPS/IL-13-induced bronchial epithelial cell injury and neutrophilic asthma in mice by inhibiting ferroptosis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; [Int. Immunopharmacol. 109 (2022) 108770].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferroptosis occurred in the lung of mice suffering OVA/LPS-induced neutrophilic asthma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liproxstatin-1 alleviated neutrophilic asthma in mice by inhibiting ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liproxstatin-1 could prevent LPS/IL-13-induced ferroptosis and inflammatory factor release in HBE and BEAS-2B cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liproxstatin-1 inhibited ferroptosis in asthmatic mice lung tissues and bronchial epithelial cells via the GPX4/SLC7A11 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Ferroptosis is closely associated with respiratory diseases; however, the relationship between ferroptosis and neutrophilic asthma remains unknown. This study investigated whether Liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1) affects the progression of neutrophilic asthma by inhibiting ferroptosis and inflammatory response, while dissecting the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE and BEAS-2B) were administered with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) to generate a cell injury model. This cell model was employed to examine the effect of Lip-1 on airway epithelial-associated inflammation and ferroptosis as well as the underlying molecular mechanism. Meanwhile, we evaluated the effects of Lip-1 on neutrophilic asthma and ferroptosis by using the ovalbumin (OVA)/LPS-induced mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Lip-1 reversed the altered expression of ferroptotic regulators (glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2)), attenuated lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS) and ameliorated cell viability in HBE and BEAS-2B cells administered with LPS and IL-13. Moreover, Lip-1 treatment led to a marked reduction in the expression of IL-33, TSLP, IL-8, IL-6, and HMGB1 in the HBE and BEAS-2B cells. In the meantime, administration with Lip-1 markedly relieved OVA/LPS-induced neutrophilic asthma, as indicated by significant improvement in lung pathological changes, airway mucus secretion, inflammation, and ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study provides data suggesting that Lip-1 alleviates neutrophilic asthma in vivo and in vitro through inhibiting ferroptosis, perhaps providing a new strategy for neutrophilic asthma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin alleviates LPS-induced lung injury and edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin prolongs the survival rates of mice suffered from lethal doses of LPS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin attenuates NLRP3/GADMD pathway-driven pyroptosis via inhibiting oxidative stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin inhibits LPS-induced ALI through regulating the feasible interactions between Nrf2 signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/ acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is featured by intensive inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, which lead to cytokine storms and pyroptosis. Here, we aimed to investigate whether melatonin was capable of alleviating LPS-induced ALI via activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 (Nrf2/HO-1) signaling axis and inhibiting pyroptosis. Mice were injected with melatonin (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for consecutive five days before LPS instillation intratracheally, and human alveolar epithelial cell (AECⅡ) A549 cell lines and murine macrophages Raw264.7 cell lines were pretreated with melatonin (400 μM) before LPS (10 μg/ml) stimulation. The result demonstrated that LPS induced obvious lung injury characterized by alveolar damage, neutrophil infiltration and lung edema as well as the reduction of the survival rate of mice, which were totally reversed by melatonin pretreatment. Mechanistically, melatonin pretreatment activated nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor (Nrf) 2 signaling, subsequently, drove antioxidant pathways including significant increases in the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, Mn-SOD and Catalase in vivo and in vitro. Simultaneously, melatonin inhibited ROS and MDA overproduction, iNOS expression as well as TNF-α and IL-1β expression and release. Furthermore, melatonin inhibited LPS-induced pyroptosis by reversing the overexpression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18 and GSDMD-N, as well as LDH release and TUNEL-positive cells in A549 cells and Raw264.7 cells. Overall, the current study suggests that melatonin exerts protective roles on LPS-induced ALI and pyroptosis by inhibiting NLRP3-GSDMD pathway via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 infection of human-induced pluripotent stem cells-derived lung lineage cells evokes inflammatory and chemosensory responses by targeting mitochondrial pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35460571/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the lung, particularly the proximal airway and distal alveolar cells. NKX2.1+ primordial lung progenitors of the foregut (anterior) endoderm are the developmental precursors to all adult lung epithelial lineages and are postulated to play an important role in viral tropism. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 readily infected and replicated in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived proximal airway cells, distal alveolar cells, and lung progenitors. In addition to the upregulation of antiviral defense and immune responses, transcriptomics data uncovered a robust epithelial cell-specific response, including perturbation of metabolic processes and disruption in the alveolar maturation program. We also identified spatiotemporal dysregulation of mitochondrial heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), which is associated with defense against antioxidant-induced lung injury. Cytokines, such as TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-6, and IL-13, were upregulated in infected cells sparking mitochondrial ROS production and change in electron transport chain complexes. Increased mitochondrial ROS then activated additional proinflammatory cytokines leading to an aberrant cell cycle resulting in apoptosis. Notably, we are the first to report a chemosensory response resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection similar to that seen in COVID-19 patients. Some of our key findings were validated using COVID-19-affected postmortem lung tissue sections. These results suggest that our in vitro system could serve as a suitable model to investigate the pathogenetic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to discover and test therapeutic drugs against COVID-19 or its consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cytoplasmic PARP1 links the genome instability to the inhibition of antiviral immunity through PARylating cGAS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35460603/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNA damage induces the cytosolic translocation of PARP1 in an iNOS-dependent manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNA-PK phosphorylates PARP1 on Thr&lt;sup&gt;594&lt;/sup&gt; and instructs its cytosolic translocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PARP1 PARylates human cGAS on D191 or mouse cGAS on E176 to terminate its DNA binding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PARP1-mediated PARylation of cGAS inhibits antiviral immunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virus infection modulates both host immunity and host genomic stability. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a key nuclear sensor of DNA damage, which maintains genomic integrity, and the successful application of PARP1 inhibitors for clinical anti-cancer therapy has lasted for decades. However, precisely how PARP1 gains access to cytoplasm and regulates antiviral immunity remains unknown. Here, we report that DNA virus induces a reactive nitrogen species (RNS)-dependent DNA damage and activates DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Activated DNA-PK phosphorylates PARP1 on Thr&lt;sup&gt;594&lt;/sup&gt;, thus facilitating the cytoplasmic translocation of PARP1 to inhibit the antiviral immunity both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, cytoplasmic PARP1 interacts with and directly PARylates cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) on Asp&lt;sup&gt;191&lt;/sup&gt; to inhibit its DNA-binding ability. Together, our findings uncover an essential role of PARP1 in linking virus-induced genome instability with inhibition of host immunity, which is of relevance to cancer, autoinflammation, and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rabeprazole Promotes Vascular Repair and Resolution of Sepsis-Induced Inflammatory Lung Injury through HIF-1α</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35563731/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no effective treatments for sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The repositioning of existing drugs is one possible effective strategy for the treatment of sepsis and ARDS. We previously showed that vascular repair and the resolution of sepsis-induced inflammatory lung injury is dependent upon endothelial HIF-1α/FoxM1 signaling. The aim of this study was to identify a candidate inducer of HIF-1α/FoxM1 signaling for the treatment of sepsis and ARDS. Employing high throughput screening of a library of 1200 FDA-approved drugs by using hypoxia response element (HRE)-driven luciferase reporter assays, we identified Rabeprazole (also known as Aciphex) as a top HIF-α activator. In cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells, Rabeprazole induced HIF1A mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. A dose-response study of Rabeprazole in a mouse model of endotoxemia-induced inflammatory lung injury identified a dose that was well tolerated and enhanced vascular repair and the resolution of inflammatory lung injury. Rabeprazole treatment resulted in reductions in lung vascular leakage, edema, and neutrophil sequestration and proinflammatory cytokine expression during the repair phrase. We next used &lt;em&gt;Hif1a/Tie2Cre&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice and &lt;em&gt;Foxm1/Tie2Cre&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice to show that Rabeprazole promoted vascular repair through HIF-1α/FoxM1 signaling. In conclusion, Rabeprazole is a potent inducer of HIF-1α that promotes vascular repair and the resolution of sepsis-induced inflammatory lung injury via endothelial HIF-1α/FoxM1 signaling. This drug therefore represents a promising candidate for repurposing to effectively treat severe sepsis and ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the leading pulmonary inflammatory disorders causing significant morbidity and mortality. Vincamine is a novel phytochemical with promising anti-inflammatory properties. In the current work, the protective effect of vincamine was studied in vitro (Raw 264.7 macrophages) and in vivo against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced ALI in Swiss albino mice. Vincamine significantly reduced nitrite and TNF-α release from the LPS stimulated macrophages and increased the levels of IL-10, indicating potent anti-inflammatory effects. It was observed that vincamine at the dose of 40 mg/kg, significantly reduced LPS induced inflammatory cell count in blood and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Further, vincamine exerted potent suppression of inflammation by reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, while significantly increased (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and IL-22). Interestingly, histological changes were reversed in vincamine treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly enhanced expression of NF-κB, TNF-α and COX-2 while reduced expression of Nrf-2 in disease control group, which were significantly (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) ameliorated by vincamine. We, to the best of our knowledge, report for the first time that vincamine possesses protective potential against LPS induced inflammation and oxidative stress, possibly by inhibiting the NF-κB cascade, while positively regulating the Nrf-2 pathway. These findings are of potential relevance for COVID-19 management concerning the fact that lung injury and ARDS are its critical features.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil phenotypes in bronchial airways differentiate single from dual responding allergic asthmatics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35437872/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35437872/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Allergic asthmatics with both an early (EAR) and a late allergic reaction (LAR) following allergen exposure are termed &amp;lsquo;dual responders&amp;rsquo; (DR), while &amp;lsquo;single responders&amp;rsquo; (SR) only have an EAR. Mechanisms that differentiate DR from SR are largely unknown, particularly regarding the role and phenotypes of neutrophils. Therefore, we aimed to study neutrophils in DR and SR asthmatics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Thirty-four allergic asthmatics underwent an inhaled allergen challenge, samples were collected before and up to 24 h post-challenge. Cell differentials were counted from bronchial lavage, alveolar lavage and blood; and tissue neutrophils were quantified in immune-stained bronchial biopsies. Lavage neutrophil nuclei lobe segmentation was used to classify active (1-4 lobes) from suppressive neutrophils (≥5 lobes). Levels of transmigration markers: soluble (s)CD62L and interleukin-1Ra, and activity markers: neutrophil elastase (NE), DNA-histone complex and dsDNA were measured in lavage fluid and plasma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with SR at baseline, DR had more neutrophils in their bronchial airways at baseline, both in the lavage (p = .0031) and biopsies (p = .026) and elevated bronchial neutrophils correlated with less antitransmigratory IL-1Ra levels (r = -0.64). DR airways had less suppressive neutrophils and more 3-lobed (active) neutrophils (p = .029) that correlated with more bronchial lavage histone (p = .020) and more plasma NE (p = .0016). Post-challenge, DR released neutrophil extracellular trap factors in the blood earlier and had less pro-transmigratory sCD62L during the late phase (p = .0076) than in SR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; DR have a more active airway neutrophil phenotype at baseline and a distinct neutrophil response to allergen challenge that may contribute to the development of an LAR. Therefore, neutrophil activity should be considered during targeted diagnosis and bio-therapeutic development for DR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Messages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dual responding allergic asthmatics have more baseline airway neutrophils with an active morphology than single responders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased airway neutrophils in dual responders were associated with less antimigration signalling rather than more chemoattraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-challenge, dual responders release an active neutrophil response in the blood earlier than in single responders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Targeted Therapy for Inflammatory Diseases with Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Their Derived Exosomes: From Basic to Clinics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a beneficial and physiological process, but there are a number of inflammatory diseases which have detrimental effects on the body. In addition, the drugs used to treat inflammation have toxic side effects when used over a long period of time. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells that can be isolated from a variety of tissues and can be differentiate into diverse cell types under appropriate conditions. They also exhibit noteworthy anti-inflammatory properties, providing new options for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The therapeutic potential of MSCs is currently being investigated for various inflammatory diseases, such as kidney injury, lung injury, osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). MSCs can perform multiple functions, including immunomodulation, homing, and differentiation, to enable damaged tissues to form a balanced inflammatory and regenerative microenvironment under severe inflammatory conditions. In addition, accumulated evidence indicates that exosomes from extracellular vesicles of MSCs (MSC-Exos) play an extraordinary role, mainly by transferring their components to recipient cells. In this review, we summarize the mechanism and clinical trials of MSCs and MSC-Exos in various inflammatory diseases in detail, with a view to contributing to the treatment of MSCs and MSC-Exos in inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alveolar macrophage-derived NRP2 curtails lung injury while boosting host defense in bacterial pneumonia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearance of airway intruders by immune cells is required to resolve infectious pneumonia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Here, we demonstrated that alveolar macrophage (AM)-derived neuropilin 2 (NRP2) plays an essential role in controlling severe pneumonia by enhancing microbial clearance. Mice with conditional deletion of the &lt;em&gt;NRP2&lt;/em&gt; gene in AM had persistent bacteria, uncontrolled neutrophil influx, and decreased survival during &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;-induced pneumonia. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; assays demonstrated that NRP2 could bind to CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6G&lt;sup&gt;lo/+&lt;/sup&gt; neutrophils and promote their capacities in phagocytosis and killing of bacteria, which is partially contributed to the increased expression of &lt;em&gt;TLR4&lt;/em&gt; and TNF-α. These findings collectively revealed that AM-derived NRP2 protects the lungs from unwanted injury by promoting the clearance of invading pathogens. This study might provide a promising diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for severe pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HLA-A2 Promotes the Therapeutic Effect of Umbilical Cord Blood-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Hyperoxic Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most extensively studied stem cell types owing to their capacity for differentiation into multiple lineages as well as their ability to secrete regenerative factors and modulate immune functions. However, issues remain regarding their further application for cell therapy. Here, to demonstrate the superiority of the improvement of MSCs, we divided umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (UCB-MSCs) from 15 donors into two groups based on efficacy and revealed donor-dependent variations in the anti-inflammatory effect of MSCs on macrophages as well as their immunoregulatory effect on T cells. Through surface marker analyses (242 antibodies), we found that HLA-A2 was positively related to the anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory function of MSCs. Additionally, HLA-A2 mRNA silencing in MSCs attenuated their therapeutic effects in vitro; namely, the suppression of LPS-stimulated macrophages and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cells. Moreover, HLA-A2 silencing in MSCs significantly decreased their therapeutic effects in a rat model of hyperoxic lung damage. The present study provides novel insights into the quality control of donor-derived MSCs for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impairment of Mitochondrial ATP Synthesis Induces RIPK3-dependent Necroptosis in Lung Epithelial Cells During Lung Injury by Lung Inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysfunction of mitochondrial metabolism is implicated in cellular injury and cell death. While mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with lung injury by lung inflammation, the mechanism by which the impairment of mitochondrial ATP synthesis regulates necroptosis during acute lung injury (ALI) by lung inflammation is unclear. Here, we showed that the impairment of mitochondrial ATP synthesis induces receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 3 (RIPK3)-dependent necroptosis during lung injury by lung inflammation. We found that the impairment of mitochondrial ATP synthesis by oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP synthase, resulted in increased lung injury and RIPK3 levels in lung tissues during lung inflammation by LPS in mice. The elevated RIPK3 and RIPK3 phosphorylation levels by oligomycin resulted in high mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) phosphorylation, the terminal molecule in necroptotic cell death pathway, in lung epithelial cells during lung inflammation. Moreover, the levels of protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were increased by the activation of necroptosis via oligomycin during lung inflammation. Furthermore, the levels of ATP5A, a catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex for ATP synthesis, were reduced in lung epithelial cells of lung tissues from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of ALI. The levels of RIPK3, RIPK3 phosphorylation and MLKL phosphorylation were elevated in lung epithelial cells in patients with ARDS. Our results suggest that the impairment of mitochondrial ATP synthesis induces RIPK3-dependent necroptosis in lung epithelial cells during lung injury by lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>cGAS modulates cytokine secretion and bacterial burdens by altering the release of mitochondrial DNA in pseudomonas pulmonary infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35420160/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is essential for fighting against viruses and bacteria, but how cGAS is involved in host immune response remains largely elusive. Here, we uncover the crucial role of cGAS in host immunity based on a &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; pulmonary infection model. &lt;em&gt;cGAS&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice showed more heavy bacterial burdens and serious lung injury accompanied with exorbitant proinflammatory cytokines than wild-type mice. cGAS deficiency caused an accumulation of mitochondrial DNA in the cytoplasm, which, in turn, induced excessive secretion of proinflammatory factors by activating inflammasome and TLR9 signalling. Mechanistically, cGAS deficiency inhibited the recruitment of LC3 by reducing the binding capacity of TBK-1 to p62, leading to impaired mitophagy and augmented release of mitochondrial DNA. Importantly, cytoplasmic mitochondrial DNA also acted as a feedback signal that induced the activation of cGAS. Altogether, these findings identify protective and homeostasis functions of cGAS against &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; infection, adding significant insight into the pathogenesis of bacterial infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Secretome of Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Consecutive Hypoxic Cultures Promotes Resolution of Lung Inflammation by Reprogramming Anti-Inflammatory Macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35457151/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secretome from hypoxia-preconditioned mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been shown to promote resolution of inflammation and alleviate acute lung injury (ALI) through its immunomodulatory function. However, the effects of consecutive hypoxic culture on immunomodulatory function of the MSCs secretome are largely unclarified. Here, we intend to investigate the effects of consecutive hypoxia on therapeutic efficacy of conditioned medium derived from MSCs (MSCs-CM) in alleviating ALI. Human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) were consecutively cultured in 21% O2 (Nor-MSCs) or in 1% O2 (Hypo-MSCs) from passage 0. Their conditioned medium (Nor-CM and Hypo-CM respectively) was collected and administered into ALI models. Our findings confirmed that Hypo-MSCs exhibited increased proliferation ability and decreased cell senescence compared with Nor-MSCs. Consecutive hypoxia promoted UC-MSCs to secrete immunomodulatory cytokines, such as insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF1), IL10, TNFα-stimulated gene 6(TSG6), TGFβ, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Both Nor-CM and Hypo-CM could effectively limit lung inflammation, promote efferocytosis and modulate anti-inflammatory polarization of lung macrophages in ALI models. Moreover, the effects of Hypo-CM were more potent than Nor-CM. Taken together, our findings indicate that consecutive hypoxic cultures could not only promote both proliferation and quality of UC-MSCs, but also enhance the therapeutic efficacy of their secretome in mitigating lung inflammation by promoting efferocytosis and anti-inflammatory polarization of macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Geraniol Ameliorates Doxorubicin-Mediated Kidney Injury through Alteration of Antioxidant Status, Inflammation, and Apoptosis: Potential Roles of NF-κB and Nrf2/Ho-1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35458182/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doxorubicin-mediated kidney impairment is a serious problem in cancer treatment. Accordingly, this work investigated the ability of geraniol to modulate doxorubicin-induced kidney damage using a rat model. Rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control, doxorubicin (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, i.p.), doxorubicin plus 100 mg/kg of geraniol, and doxorubicin plus 200 mg/kg of geraniol. A single doxorubicin injection triggered kidney impairment, as evidenced by the altered serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and albumin values; it also caused histological changes in the kidney architecture. Additionally, doxorubicin enhanced lipid peroxidation while lowering reduced glutathione, catalase activity, and the expression of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. Interestingly, pre-treatment with geraniol rescued doxorubicin-induced alterations in kidney antioxidant parameters, enzymatic activity, and the expression of inflammatory and apoptosis-mediating gene and proteins. Moreover, prophylactic treatment with geraniol preserved most kidney histological characteristics in a dose-dependent manner. These findings support that geraniol could protect against doxorubicin-mediated kidney dysfunction. However, further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms of geraniol&amp;rsquo;s protective effects against doxorubicin-mediated kidney dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of METTL3 attenuates renal injury and inflammation by alleviating TAB3 m6A modifications via IGF2BP2-dependent mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35417191/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in renal diseases is largely unknown. Here, we characterized the role of N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-adenosine-methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), whose expression is elevated in renal tubules in different acute kidney injury (AKI) models as well as in human biopsies and cultured tubular epithelial cells (TECs). &lt;em&gt;METTL3&lt;/em&gt; silencing alleviated renal inflammation and programmed cell death in TECs in response to stimulation by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cisplatin, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whereas METTL3 overexpression had the opposite effects. Conditional knockout of &lt;em&gt;METTL3&lt;/em&gt; from mouse kidneys attenuated cisplatin- and ischemic/reperfusion (I/R)-induced renal dysfunction, injury, and inflammation. Moreover, &lt;em&gt;TAB3&lt;/em&gt; [TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 3] was identified as a target of METTL3 by m6A methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing. The stability of TAB3 was increased through binding of IGF2BP2 (insulin-like growth factor 2 binding protein 2) to its m6A-modified stop codon regions. The proinflammatory effects of TAB3 were then explored both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated &lt;em&gt;METTL3&lt;/em&gt; silencing attenuated renal injury and inflammation in cisplatin- and LPS-induced AKI mouse models. We further identified Cpd-564 as a METTL3 inhibitor that had better protective effects against cisplatin- and ischemia/reperfusion-induced renal injury and inflammation than S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, a previously identified METTL3 inhibitor. Collectively, METTL3 promoted m6A modifications of TAB3 and enhanced its stability via IGF2BP2-dependent mechanisms. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of METTL3 attenuated renal injury and inflammation, suggesting that the METTL3/TAB3 axis is a potential target for treatment of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Potential Pro-Inflammatory Effect of Vitamin E Analogs through Mitigation of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Binding to the Cannabinoid 2 Receptor</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35457108/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin E acetate, which is used as a diluent of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has been reported as the primary causative agent of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). Here, we employ in vitro assays, docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations to investigate the interaction of vitamin E with the membrane-bound cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R), and its role in modulating the binding affinity of THC to CB2R. From the MD simulations, we determined that vitamin E interacts with both CB2R and membrane phospholipids. Notably, the synchronized effect of these interactions likely facilitates vitamin E acting as a lipid modulator for the cannabinoid system. Furthermore, MD simulation and trajectory analysis show that when THC binds to CB2R in the presence of vitamin E, the binding cavity widens, facilitating the entry of water molecules into it, leading to a reduced interaction of THC with CB2R. Additionally, the interaction between THC and vitamin E in solution is stabilized by several H bonds, which can directly limit the interaction of free THCs with CB2R. Overall, both the MD simulations and the in vitro dissociation assay results indicate that THC binding to CB2R is reduced in the presence of vitamin E. Our study discusses the role of vitamin E in limiting the effect of THCs and its implications on the reported pathology of EVALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aedes aegypti sialokinin facilitates mosquito blood feeding and modulates host immunity and vascular biology</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35417706/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vasodilator sialokinin induces nitric oxide release similarly to substance P&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sialokinin KO mosquitoes shows lower blood perfusion and longer probing time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sialokinin interferes with host hemostasis via NK1R signaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sialokinin promotes endothelial permeability and leukocyte recruitment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saliva from mosquitoes contains vasodilators that antagonize vasoconstrictors produced at the bite site. Sialokinin is a vasodilator present in the saliva of &lt;em&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/em&gt;. Here, we investigate its function and describe its mechanism of action during blood feeding. Sialokinin induces nitric oxide release similar to substance P. Sialokinin-KO mosquitoes produce lower blood perfusion than parental mosquitoes at the bite site during probing and have significantly longer probing times, which result in lower blood feeding success. In contrast, there is no difference in feeding between KO and parental mosquitoes when using artificial membrane feeders or mice that are treated with a substance P receptor antagonist, confirming that sialokinin interferes with host hemostasis via NK1R signaling. While sialokinin-KO saliva does not affect virus infection in vitro, it stimulates macrophages and inhibits leukocyte recruitment in vivo. This work highlights the biological functionality of salivary proteins in blood feeding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of mango and mint pod-based e-cigarette aerosol inhalation on inflammatory states of the brain, lung, heart, and colon in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While health effects of conventional tobacco are well defined, data on vaping devices, including one of the most popular e-cigarettes which have high nicotine levels, are less established. Prior acute e-cigarette studies have demonstrated inflammatory and cardiopulmonary physiology changes while chronic studies have demonstrated extra-pulmonary effects, including neurotransmitter alterations in reward pathways. In this study we investigated the impact of inhalation of aerosols produced from pod-based, flavored e-cigarettes (JUUL) aerosols three times daily for 3 months on inflammatory markers in the brain, lung, heart, and colon. JUUL aerosol exposure induced upregulation of cytokine and chemokine gene expression and increased HMGB1 and RAGE in the nucleus accumbens in the central nervous system. Inflammatory gene expression increased in the colon, while gene expression was more broadly altered by e-cigarette aerosol inhalation in the lung. Cardiopulmonary inflammatory responses to acute lung injury with lipopolysaccharide were exacerbated in the heart. Flavor-specific findings were detected across these studies. Our findings suggest that daily e-cigarette use may cause neuroinflammation, which may contribute to behavioral changes and mood disorders. In addition, e-cigarette use may cause gut inflammation, which has been tied to poor systemic health, and cardiac inflammation, which leads to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA PCAT1 activates SOX2 and suppresses radioimmune responses via regulating cGAS/STING signalling in non-small cell lung cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35415876/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) prostate cancer-associated ncRNA transcripts 1 (PCAT1) is increased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It stimulates tumour growth and metastasis, but its role in the radioimmune responses remain unknown. We aimed to explore the impacts of PCAT1 on tumorigenesis and radioimmune responses and the underlying molecular mechanisms in NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify immunosuppressive lncRNAs involved with tumour invasion in NSCLC. The expression levels of PCAT1 were analysed by in situ hybridisation in 55 paired NSCLC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Both loss- and gain-of-function assays were performed to examine the effects of PCAT1 and SOX2 on NSCLC cell behaviours in vivo and in vitro. Bioinformatic analyses, chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were applied to validate the regulatory effects of PCAT1 on SOX2 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase and rescue assays were utilised to identify the relationship between SOX2 and the cGAS/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signalling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; PCAT1 was immunosuppressive and related with NSCLC invasion. Increased PCAT1 was negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration in NSCLC. PCAT1 knockdown restrained proliferation, increased apoptosis, and repressed cell metastasis in vivo and in vitro. PCAT1 activated SOX2 that accelerated tumorigenesis and immunosuppression. SOX2 promoted tumour growth through inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell immunity. Moreover, SOX2 restrained cGAS transcription and hampered downstream type I interferon (IFN)-induced immune responses. Inhibition of PCAT1/SOX2 in collaboration with radiation further inhibited tumour growth, and initiated the cGAS/STING signalling pathway, which enhanced the immune responses of radiotherapy in NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; PCAT1/SOX2 axis promoted tumorigenesis and immunosuppression through inhibition of cGAS/STING signalling-mediated T-cell activation. Inhibition of PCAT1 and SOX2 synergised with radiotherapy to activate the immune response and could serve as potential therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of Cellular Metabolism in the Formation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Airway Diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a recently described mechanism of neutrophils that play an important role in health and disease. NETs are an innate defense mechanism that participate in clearance of pathogens, but they may also cause collateral damage in unrelated host tissues. Neutrophil dysregulation and NETosis occur in multiple lung diseases, such as pathogen-induced acute lung injury, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe asthma, cystic fibrosis, and recently, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. More recently, research into immunometabolism has surged due to the possibility of reprogramming metabolism in order to modulate immune functions. The present review analyzes the different metabolic pathways associated with NETs formation, and how these impact on pathologies of the airways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distinct Role of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in Protective Immunity Against Orientia tsutsugamushi Infection in Mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infection with &lt;em&gt;Orientia tsutsugamushi&lt;/em&gt;, an obligate intracellular bacterium, can cause mild or severe scrub typhus. Some patients develop acute lung injury, multi-organ failure, and fatal infection; however, little is known regarding key immune mediators that mediate infection control or disease pathogenesis. Using murine models of scrub typhus, we demonstrated in this study the requirement of TNF-TNFR signaling in protective immunity against this infection. Mice lacking both TNF receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2) were highly susceptible to &lt;em&gt;O. tsutsugamushi&lt;/em&gt; infection, displaying significantly increased tissue bacterial burdens and succumbing to infection by day 9, while most wild-type mice survived through day 20. This increased susceptibility correlated with poor activation of cellular immunity in inflamed tissues. Flow cytometry of lung- and spleen-derived cells revealed profound deficiencies in total numbers and activation status of NK cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, as well as CD4 and CD8 T cells. To define the role of individual receptors in &lt;em&gt;O. tsutsugamushi&lt;/em&gt; infection, we used mice lacking either TNFR1 or TNFR2. While deficiency in either receptor alone was sufficient to increase host susceptibility to the infection, TNFR1 and TNFR2 played a distinct role in cellular responses. TNF signaling through TNFR1 promoted inflammatory responses and effector T cell expansion, while TNFR2 signaling was associated with anti-inflammatory action and tissue homeostasis. Moreover, TNFRs played an intrinsic role in CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell activation, revealing an indispensable role of TNF in protective immunity against &lt;em&gt;O. tsutsugamushi&lt;/em&gt; infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LATS1 is a central signal transmitter for achieving full type-I interferon activity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35394840/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interferons (IFNs) have broad-spectrum antiviral activity to resist virus epidemic. However, IFN antiviral efficacy needs to be greatly improved. Here, we reveal that LATS1 is a vital signal transmitter governing full type-I IFN (IFN-I) signaling activity. LATS1 constitutively binds with the IFN-I receptor IFNAR2 and is rapidly tyro-phosphorylated by Tyk2 upon IFN-I engagement. Tyro-phosphorylation of LATS1 promotes LATS1 activation and YAP degradation, thereby promoting IFN-mediated antiproliferation activity. Moreover, activated LATS1 translocates into the nucleus and induces CDK8-Ser62 phosphorylation, which in turn phosphorylates STAT1 at Ser&lt;sup&gt;727&lt;/sup&gt; and induces full IFN-I antiviral activity. LATS1 deficiency restricts in vivo IFN-I signaling and attenuates host antiviral immune response. Our study identifies IFN-I as a previously unidentified extracellular diffusible ligand signal for activation of the Hippo core LATS1 pathway and reveals Tyk2-LATS1-CDK8 as a complete signaling cascade controlling full IFN-I activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor attenuates acute lung injury via inhibiting macrophages&#39; activation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MANF was up-regulated in inflammatory lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MANF deficiency in macrophages induced lung inflammation and aggravated LPS-induced lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recombinant human MANF attenuated LPS-induced lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MANF deficiency in macrophages promoted macrophages to M1differentiation in lung tissues of ALI mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recombinant human MANF restricted macrophages to M1 differentiation in lung tissues of ALI mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is an urgent respiratory disease without effective treatment. Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF)has been demonstrated to play a suppressive role in some inflammatory conditions. However, the effect of MANF on ALI has not yet been reported. In this study, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the patients with or without pulmonary inflammation, and used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce mice ALI model. Mono-macrophage-specific MANF knockout (MKO) mice were constructed and recombinant human MANF protein was used to ALI mice. We found that the endogenous MANF protein in both human BALF and mice lung tissues was increased in inflammatory conditions. MANF level in the macrophages of inflammatory lung was higher than that in normal controls in both human and mice. MANF deficiency in macrophages induced lung inflammation and aggravated LPS-induced lung injury. MANF lowered LPS-induced lung injury, inhibited macrophage polarization to M1 functional type. Meanwhile, MANF inhibited-LPS induced activation of NF-κB signal pathway by down regulating phosphorylated p65in lung tissue and macrophages. These results indicate that MANF acts as a suppressor in ALI via negatively regulating NF-κB activation and macrophages polarization, which may be a novel potential target and shed light on ALI therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ameliorative Effect of Dexamethasone on the Development of Autoimmune Lung Injury and Mediastinal Fat-Associated Lymphoid Clusters in an Autoimmune Disease Mouse Model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35457267/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our previous study, we revealed the ameliorative therapeutic effect of dexamethasone (Dex) for Lupus nephritis lesions in the MRL/MpJ-&lt;em&gt;Fas&lt;sup&gt;lpr/lpr&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Lpr) mouse model. The female Lpr mice developed a greater number of mediastinal fat-associated lymphoid clusters (MFALCs) and inflammatory lung lesions compared to the male mice. However, the effect of Dex, an immunosuppressive drug, on both lung lesions and the development of MFALCs in Lpr mice has not been identified yet. Therefore, in this study, we compared the development of lung lesions and MFALCs in female Lpr mice that received either saline (saline group &amp;ldquo;SG&amp;rdquo;) or dexamethasone (dexamethasone group &amp;ldquo;DG&amp;rdquo;) in drinking water as a daily dose along with weekly intraperitoneal injections for 10 weeks. Compared to the SG group, the DG group showed a significant reduction in the levels of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies, the size of MFALCs, the degree of lung injury, the area of high endothelial venules (HEVs), and the number of proliferating and immune cells in both MFALCs and the lungs. A significant positive correlation was observed between the size of MFALCs and the cellular aggregation in the lungs of Lpr mice. Therefore, this study confirmed the ameliorative effect of Dex on the development of lung injury and MFALCs via their regressive effect on both immune cells&amp;rsquo; proliferative activity and the development of HEVs. Furthermore, the reprogramming of MFALCs by targeting immune cells and HEVs may provide a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune-disease-associated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-17-induced HIF1α drives resistance to anti-PD-L1 via fibroblast-mediated immune exclusion</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35389431/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests that intratumoral inflammation has an outsized influence on antitumor immunity. Here, we report that IL-17, a proinflammatory cytokine widely associated with poor prognosis in solid tumors, drives the therapeutic failure of anti-PD-L1. By timing the deletion of IL-17 signaling specifically in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in late-stage tumors, we show that IL-17 signaling drives immune exclusion by activating a collagen deposition program in murine models of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Ablation of IL-17 signaling in CAFs increased the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells into the tumor mass and sensitized otherwise resistant cSCC to anti-PD-L1 treatment. Mechanistically, the collagen deposition program in CAFs was driven by IL-17-induced translation of HIF1α, which was mediated by direct binding of Act1, the adaptor protein of IL-17 receptor, to a stem-loop structure in the 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated region (UTR) in Hif1α mRNA. Disruption of Act1&amp;rsquo;s binding to Hif1α mRNA abolished IL-17-induced collagen deposition and enhanced anti-PD-L1-mediated tumor regression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanism of taurine reducing inflammation and organ injury in sepsis mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35421705/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental basis for the pathogenesis of sepsis is an inflammatory imbalance, which is considered to be the main target for treatment. Taurine is an intracellular free amino acid that has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. To investigate the protective mechanism of taurine in sepsis, we used in vitro and in vivo experiments to explore the effects of taurine on neutrophil and monocyte immune function. Metabolomic analysis showed large amounts of taurine in neutrophils and monocytes and a dramatic decrease in taurine levels after LPS exposure. Taurine supplementation decreased the expressions of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in LPS-challenged neutrophils and monocytes and reduced the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by restricting reactive oxygen species. Moreover, taurine protected septic mice from death, improved tissue injuries in the lung, liver, and kidney by reducing neutrophil infiltration and TNF-α production. Our data indicate that a supplement with taurine might be a promising therapeutic strategy for sepsis to reduce hyper inflammation and improve multi-organ dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Early IL-17A production helps establish Mycobacterium intracellulare infection in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection is common in patients with structural lung damage. To address how NTM infection is established and causes lung damage, we established an NTM mouse model by intranasal inoculation of clinical isolates of &lt;em&gt;M. intracellulare&lt;/em&gt;. During the 39-week course of infection, the bacteria persistently grew in the lung and caused progressive granulomatous and fibrotic lung damage with mortality exceeding 50%. Lung neutrophils were significantly increased at 1 week postinfection, reduced at 2 weeks postinfection and increased again at 39 weeks postinfection. IL-17A was increased in the lungs at 1-2 weeks of infection and reduced at 3 weeks postinfection. Depletion of neutrophils during early (0-2 weeks) and late (32-34 weeks) infection had no effect on mortality or lung damage in chronically infected mice. However, neutralization of IL-17A during early infection significantly reduced bacterial burden, fibrotic lung damage, and mortality in chronically infected mice. Since it is known that IL-17A regulates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and that MMPs contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, we determined the levels of MMPs in the lungs of &lt;em&gt;M. intracellulare&lt;/em&gt;-infected mice. Interestingly, MMP-3 was significantly reduced by anti-IL-17A neutralizing antibody. Moreover, in vitro data showed that exogenous IL-17A exaggerated the production of MMP-3 by lung epithelial cells upon &lt;em&gt;M. intracellulare&lt;/em&gt; infection. Collectively, our findings suggest that early IL-17A production precedes and promotes organized pulmonary &lt;em&gt;M. intracellulare&lt;/em&gt; infection in mice, at least in part through MMP-3 production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>lincRNA-Cox2 Functions to Regulate Inflammation in Alveolar Macrophages during Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35365562/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our respiratory system is vital to protect us from the surrounding nonsterile environment; therefore, it is critical for a state of homeostasis to be maintained through a balance of inflammatory cues. Recent studies have shown that actively transcribed noncoding regions of the genome are emerging as key regulators of biological processes, including inflammation. &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt; is one such example of an inflammatory inducible long intergenic noncoding RNA functioning to fine-tune immune gene expression. Using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, in addition to FACS, we find that &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt; is most highly expressed in the lung and is most upregulated after LPS-induced lung injury (acute lung injury [ALI]) within alveolar macrophages, where it functions to regulate inflammation. We previously reported that &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt; functions to regulate its neighboring protein Ptgs2 in cis, and in this study, we use genetic mouse models to confirm its role in regulating gene expression more broadly in trans during ALI. Il6, Ccl3, and Ccl5 are dysregulated in the &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice and can be rescued to wild type levels by crossing the deficient mice with our newly generated &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt; transgenic mice, confirming that this gene functions in trans. Many genes are specifically regulated by &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt; within alveolar macrophages originating from the bone marrow because the phenotype can be reversed by transplantation of wild type bone marrow into the &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice. In conclusion, we show that &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt; is a trans-acting long noncoding RNA that functions to regulate immune responses and maintain homeostasis within the lung at baseline and on LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LPS Response Is Impaired by Urban Fine Particulate Matter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) is a complex mixture of components with diverse chemical and physical characteristics associated with increased respiratory and cardiovascular diseases mortality. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of exposure to concentrated PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; on LPS-induced lung injury onset. BALB/c male mice were exposed to either filtered air or ambient fine PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; in an ambient particle concentrator for 5 weeks. Then, an acute lung injury was induced with nebulized LPS. The animals were euthanized 24 h after the nebulization to either LPS or saline. Inflammatory cells and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF) were assessed in the blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung tissue. In addition, lung morphology was assessed by stereological methods. Our results showed that the PM+LPS group showed histological evidence of injury, leukocytosis with increased neutrophils and macrophages, and a mixed inflammatory response profile, with increased KC, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-4, and IL-17. Our analysis shows that there is an interaction between the LPS nebulization and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, differently modulating the inflammatory response, with a distinct response pattern as compared to LPS or PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure alone. Further studies are required to explain the mechanism of immune modulation caused by PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung Imaging Reveals Stroke-Induced Impairment in Pulmonary Intravascular Neutrophil Function, a Response Exacerbated with Aging</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stroke patients, infection is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. Moreover, older stroke patients show an increased risk of developing stroke-associated infection, although the mechanisms underlying this increased susceptibility to infection are unknown. In this study, using an experimental mouse model of ischemic stroke, we showed that older (12-15 mo of age) mice had elevated lung bacterial infection and inflammatory damage after stroke when compared with young (8-10 wk of age) counterparts, despite undergoing the same degree of brain injury. Intravital microscopy of the lung microvasculature revealed that in younger mice, stroke promoted neutrophil arrest in pulmonary microvessels, but this response was not seen in older poststroke mice. In addition, bacterial phagocytosis by neutrophils in the lung microvasculature was reduced by both aging and stroke, such that neutrophils in aged poststroke mice showed the greatest impairment in this function. Analysis of neutrophil migration in vitro and in the cremaster muscle demonstrated that stroke alone did not negatively impact neutrophil migration, but that the combination of increased age and stroke led to reduced effectiveness of neutrophil chemotaxis. Transcriptomic analysis of pulmonary neutrophils using RNA sequencing identified 79 genes that were selectively altered in the context of combined aging and stroke, and they were associated with pathways that control neutrophil chemotaxis. Taken together, the findings of this study show that stroke in older animals results in worsening of neutrophil antibacterial responses and changes in neutrophil gene expression that have the potential to underpin elevated risk of stroke-associated infection in the context of increased age.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel insights into NOD-like receptors in renal diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs), including NLRAs, NLRBs (also known as NAIPs), NLRCs, and NLRPs, are a major subfamily of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Owing to a recent surge in research, NLRs have gained considerable attention due to their involvement in mediating the innate immune response and perpetuating inflammatory pathways, which is a central phenomenon in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, including renal diseases. NLRs are expressed in different renal tissues during pathological conditions, which suggest that these receptors play roles in acute kidney injury, obstructive nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, crystal nephropathy, uric acid nephropathy, and renal cell carcinoma, among others. This review summarises recent progress on the functions of NLRs and their mechanisms in the pathophysiological processes of different types of renal diseases to help us better understand the role of NLRs in the kidney and provide a theoretical basis for NLR-targeted therapy for renal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell and spatial analysis reveal interaction of FAP&#43; fibroblasts and SPP1&#43; macrophages in colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common malignancies with limited treatments other than surgery. The tumor microenvironment (TME) profiling enables the discovery of potential therapeutic targets. Here, we profile 54,103 cells from tumor and adjacent tissues to characterize cellular composition and elucidate the potential origin and regulation of tumor-enriched cell types in CRC. We demonstrate that the tumor-specific FAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts and SPP1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages were positively correlated in 14 independent CRC cohorts containing 2550 samples and validate their close localization by immuno-fluorescent staining and spatial transcriptomics. This interaction might be regulated by chemerin, TGF-β, and interleukin-1, which would stimulate the formation of immune-excluded desmoplasic structure and limit the T cell infiltration. Furthermore, we find patients with high FAP or SPP1 expression achieved less therapeutic benefit from an anti-PD-L1 therapy cohort. Our results provide a potential therapeutic strategy by disrupting FAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts and SPP1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages interaction to improve immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lung injury and inflammation occurred after SD rats were treated with 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/200 μL 100 nm PS-MPs for 14 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gene sequencing detected a series of altered lncRNA and circRNA after treatment of 100 nm PS-MPs in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LncRNA XLOC_031479, lncRNA XLOC_014188, circRNA 014924, circRNA 006,603 and circ 003,982 may be potential targets for lung damage caused by PS-MPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microplastics (MPs) pollution has become a global concern due to its close relation to the environment and human health. Recently, more and more studies have pointed out the existence of MPs in the air, but its potential inhalation toxicity is unclear. Polystyrene Microplastics (PS-MPs) is one of the representative MPs. Besides, non-coding RNA plays crucial roles in regulating gene expression. Therefore, this study aims to provide new insights into the molecular exploration of PS-MPs inhalation. In this study, Sprague Dawley（SD）rats were treated with 100 nm, 500 nm, 1 μm and 2.5 μm PS-MPs for three days. And then intra-tracheal instillation of saline or 100 nm PS-MPs with 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/200 μL were performed in SD rats every two days for two consecutive weeks. The deposition of PS-MPs was observed through immunofluorescence. Lung histological alternations were observed in haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining sections. The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines were quantified by ELISA and qPCR. Genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs) in rats lung were done by ribosomal RNA depleted RNA sequencing and verified by qRT-PCR. We observed that 100 nm and 1 μm PS-MPs could deposite in the lungs. In addition, pathological examination shows alveolar destruction and bronchial epithelium arranged in a mess in PS-MPs groups. Furthermore, the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β were upregulated in PS-MPs exposed rats. Sequencing results showed that 269 circRNAs and 109 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in lung tissue of the saline and PS-MPs exposed rats. The upregulated expressions of lncRNA XLOC_031479, circRNA 014924 and circRNA 006603 and the downregulated expressions of lncRNA XLOC_014188 and circ003982 were identified by qRT-PCR in MPs group. The identified novel circRNAs and lncRNAs may paly important role in the development of lung inflammation caused by PS-MPs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is accumulating evidence that platelets play roles beyond their traditional functions in thrombosis and hemostasis, e.g., in inflammatory processes, infection and cancer, and that they interact, stimulate and regulate cells of the innate immune system such as neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages. In this review, we will focus on platelet activation in hemostatic and inflammatory processes, as well as platelet interactions with neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. We take a closer look at the contributions of major platelet receptors GPIb, α&lt;sub&gt;IIb&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, TLT-1, CLEC-2 and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as well as secretions from platelet granules on platelet-neutrophil aggregate and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in atherosclerosis, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and COVID-19. Further, we will address platelet-monocyte and macrophage interactions during cancer metastasis, infection, sepsis and platelet clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microbiota-dependent activation of the myeloid calcineurin-NFAT pathway inhibits B7H3- and B7H4-dependent anti-tumor immunity in colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbial recognition activates myeloid calcineurin and NFAT in colorectal cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFAT-dependent IL-6 promotes expression of co-inhibitory B7H3 and B7H4 by tumors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B7H3/B7H4 inhibit CD8+ T cells while their blockade elicits protective T cell responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B7H3/B7H4 expression in CRC correlates with poor CD8+ T cell infiltration and survival&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial sensing by intestinal tumor cells contributes to tumor growth through cell-intrinsic activation of the calcineurin-NFAT axis, but the role of this pathway in other intestinal cells remains unclear. Here, we found that myeloid-specific deletion of calcineurin in mice activated protective CD8+ T cell responses and inhibited colorectal cancer (CRC) growth. Microbial sensing by myeloid cells promoted calcineurin- and NFAT-dependent interleukin 6 (IL-6) release, expression of the co-inhibitory molecules B7H3 and B7H4 by tumor cells, and inhibition of CD8+ T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. Accordingly, targeting members of this pathway activated protective CD8+ T cell responses and inhibited primary and metastatic CRC growth. B7H3 and B7H4 were expressed by the majority of human primary CRCs and metastases, which was associated with low numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and poor survival. Therefore, a microbiota-, calcineurin-, and B7H3/B7H4-dependent pathway controls anti-tumor immunity, revealing additional targets for immune checkpoint inhibition in microsatellite-stable CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NEDD4 attenuates phosgene-induced acute lung injury through the inhibition of Notch1 activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35355403/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosgene gas leakage can cause life-threatening acute lung injury (ALI), which is characterized by inflammation, increased vascular permeability, pulmonary oedema and oxidative stress. Although the downregulation of neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (NEDD4) is known to be associated with inflammation and oxidative damage, its functions in phosgene-induced ALI remain unclear. In this study, rats with phosgene-induced ALI were intravenously injected with NEDD4-overexpressing lentiviruses to determine the functions of NEDD4 in this inflammatory condition. NEDD4 expression was decreased in the lung parenchyma of phosgene-exposed control rats, whereas its expression level was high in the NEDD4-overexpressing rats. Phosgene exposure increased the wet-to-dry lung weight ratio, but NEDD4 abrogated this effect. NEDD4 overexpression attenuated phosgene-induced lung inflammation, lowering the high lung injury score (based on total protein, inflammatory cells and inflammatory factors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) and also reduced phosgene-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. Finally, NEDD4 was found to interact with Notch1, enhancing its ubiquitination and thereby its degradation, thus attenuating the inflammatory responses to ALI. Therefore, we demonstrated that NEDD4 plays a protective role in alleviating phosgene-induced ALI, suggesting that enhancing the effect of NEDD4 may be a new approach for treating phosgene-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inflammatory blockade prevents injury to the developing pulmonary gas exchange surface in preterm primates</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35353543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perinatal inflammatory stress is associated with early life morbidity and lifelong consequences for pulmonary health. Chorioamnionitis, an inflammatory condition affecting the placenta and fluid surrounding the developing fetus, affects 25 to 40% of preterm births. Severe chorioamnionitis with preterm birth is associated with significantly increased risk of pulmonary disease and secondary infections in childhood, suggesting that fetal inflammation may markedly alter the development of the lung. Here, we used intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge to induce experimental chorioamnionitis in a prenatal rhesus macaque (&lt;em&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/em&gt;) model that mirrors structural and temporal aspects of human lung development. Inflammatory injury directly disrupted the developing gas exchange surface of the primate lung, with extensive damage to alveolar structure, particularly the close association and coordinated differentiation of alveolar type 1 pneumocytes and specialized alveolar capillary endothelium. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis defined a multicellular alveolar signaling niche driving alveologenesis that was extensively disrupted by perinatal inflammation, leading to a loss of gas exchange surface and alveolar simplification, with notable resemblance to chronic lung disease in newborns. Blockade of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α ameliorated LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury by blunting stromal responses to inflammation and modulating innate immune activation in myeloid cells, restoring structural integrity and key signaling networks in the developing alveolus. These data provide new insight into the pathophysiology of developmental lung injury and suggest that modulating inflammation is a promising therapeutic approach to prevent fetal consequences of chorioamnionitis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TnBP and TBOEP caused pulmonary damages by inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fkbp5&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Nos3&lt;/em&gt;/MAPK/NF-κB signal pathway was upregulated when exposing to TnBP and TBOEP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TnBP aggravated OVA induced asthmatic inflammatory response with overexpression of IgE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TnBP facilitated OVA-induced asthma by upregulating PI3K/Akt/NF-кB signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkyl organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), are ubiquitously detected in indoor and outdoor environments and their inhalation may result in lung damage. This study examined pulmonary toxicity after exposure to TnBP or TBOEP and investigated aggravation of inflammation and immunoreaction by TnBP in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mice model. Transcriptomics were used to further reveal the underlying mechanism. Exposure to TnBP or TBOEP resulted in pathological damage, including edema and thickened alveolar septum. In comparison with the control, enhanced levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01 in TnBP (High) group and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 in TBOEP (High) group), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), malondialdehyde (MDA) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), and cytokines under a dose-dependent relationship were noted, and the expression of the Fkbp5/Nos3/MAPK/NF-кB signaling pathway (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) was upregulated in the TnBP and TBOEP groups. Moreover, the combined exposure of TnBP and OVA exacerbated the allergic inflammatory response, including airway hyperresponsiveness, leukocytosis, cellular exudation and infiltration, secretion of inflammatory mediators, and higher expression of IgE (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Transcriptomics results demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt/NF-кB signal pathway was involved in TnBP-aggravated asthmatic mice. Exposure to TnBP or TBOEP resulted in oxidative damage and leukocyte-induced lung injury. TnBP can further facilitate OVA-induced asthma through an inflammatory response. This study is the first to reveal the pulmonary toxicity and potential mechanism induced by OPFRs through an in-vivo model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Induction and suppression of antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) has been observed in mammals during infection with at least seven distinct RNA viruses, including some that are pathogenic in humans. However, while the cell-autonomous immune response mediated by antiviral RNAi is gradually being recognized, little is known about systemic antiviral RNAi in mammals. Furthermore, extracellular vesicles (EVs) also function in viral signal spreading and host immunity. Here, we show that upon antiviral RNAi activation, virus-derived small-interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) from Nodamura virus (NoV), Sindbis virus (SINV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) enter the murine bloodstream via EVs for systemic circulation. vsiRNAs in the EVs are biologically active, since they confer RNA-RNA homology-dependent antiviral activity in both cultured cells and infant mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that vaccination with a live-attenuated virus, rendered deficient in RNAi suppression, induces production of stably maintained vsiRNAs and confers protective immunity against virus infection in mice. This suggests that vaccination with live-attenuated VSR (viral suppressor of RNAi)-deficient mutant viruses could be a new strategy to induce immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Alveolar epithelial cell death, inflammation, and oxidative stress are typical features of acute lung injury (ALI). Aloperine (Alo), an alkaloid isolated from Sophora alopecuroides, has been reported to display various biological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and anti-oxidant properties. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of Alo in treating a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in a murine model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The effects of Alo in LPS-induced ALI were investigated in C57BL/6 mice. The RIPK1 inhibitor (Nec-1) and the RIPK3 inhibitor (GSK&#39;872) were used to evaluate the relationship of necroptosis, NF-κB activation, and PDC subunits in LPS-treated mouse alveolar epithelial cells (MLE-12). Then the effects of Alo on necroptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress of LPS-stimulated MLE-12 cells were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Alo significantly attenuated histopathological lung injuries and reduced lung wet/dry ratio in LPS-induced ALI mice. Alo also remarkedly reduced total protein and neutrophils recruitment in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of ALI mice. Meanwhile, Alo ameliorated the LPS-induced necroptosis in the lungs of ALI mice. The RIPK3 inhibitor GSK&#39;872, but not the RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1, reversed LPS-induced p65 phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus in MLE-12 cells. GSK&#39;872 also reversed the LPS-induced increase in ROS and binding of RIPK3 and PDC subunits in MLE-12 cells. Moreover, Alo down-regulated the levels of p-RIPK1, p-RIPK3, p-MLKL, p-p65, the translocation of p65 to the nucleus, and reduced the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in LPS-stimulated MLE-12 cells. Alo also inhibited the binding of RIPK3 and PDC-E1α, PDC-E1β, PDC-E2, and PDC-E3 and the ROS production in LPS-treated MLE-12 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The present study validated the beneficial effects of Alo on LPS-induced ALI , suggesting Alo may be a new drug candidate against ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>lncRNA MEG3 restrained the M1 polarization of microglia in acute spinal cord injury through the HuR/A20/NF-κB axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammation restrict the treatment of acute spinal cord injury (ASCI), and long non-coding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) expression is lessened in ASCI. However, the function and mechanism of lncRNA MEG3 in the M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammation in ASCI are unclear. The expressions of lncRNA MEG3 in ASCI mouse spinal cord tissues and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated primary microglia and BV2 cells were quantified through a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. In-vitro assays were conducted to explore the function of lncRNA MEG3 in the M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammation in ASCI. RNA degradation, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, cycloheximide-chase, and ubiquitination analyses were carried out to probe into the mechanism of lncRNA MEG3 in the M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammation in ASCI. The lncRNA MEG3 expression was lessened in the ASCI mouse spinal cord tissues and LPS-treated primary microglia and BV2 cells, and the overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 restrained the M1 polarization of microglia and the neuroinflammation by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. For the investigation of the potential mechanism of such, the overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 restrained the M1 polarization of microglia through the HuR/A20/NF-κB axis and boosted the motor function recovery and neuroinflammation relief in the mice with SCI. The overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 restrained the M1 polarization of microglia through the HuR/A20/NF-κB axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vitamin D receptor upregulates tight junction protein claudin-5 against colitis-associated tumorigenesis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35338345/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tight junctions are essential for barrier integrity, inflammation, and cancer. Vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) play important roles in colorectal cancer (CRC). Using the human CRC database, we found colonic VDR expression was low and significantly correlated with a reduction of Claudin-5 mRNA and protein. In the colon of VDRΔIEC mice, deletion of intestinal VDR led to lower protein and mRNA levels of Claudin-5. Intestinal permeability was increased in the VDR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; colon cancer model. Lacking VDR and a reduction of Claudin-5 are associated with an increased number of tumors in the VDR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and VDR&lt;sup&gt;ΔIEC&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Furthermore, gain and loss functional studies have identified CLDN-5 as a downstream target of VDR. We identified the Vitamin D response element (VDRE) binding sites in a reporter system showed that VDRE in the Claudin-5 promoter is required for vitamin D3-induced Claudin-5 expression. Conditional epithelial VDR overexpression protected against the loss of &lt;em&gt;Claudin-5&lt;/em&gt; in response to inflammation and tumorigenesis in vivo. We also reported fecal VDR reduction in a colon cancer model. This study advances the understanding of how VDR regulates intestinal barrier functions in tumorigenesis and the possibility for identifying new biomarker and therapeutic targets to restore VDR-dependent functions in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Avian influenza viruses suppress innate immunity by inducing trans-transcriptional readthrough via SSU72</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35332300/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate immunity plays critical antiviral roles. The highly virulent avian influenza viruses (AIVs) H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6 can better escape host innate immune responses than the less virulent seasonal H1N1 virus. Here, we report a mechanism by which transcriptional readthrough (TRT)-mediated suppression of innate immunity occurs post AIV infection. By using cell lines, mouse lungs, and patient PBMCs, we showed that genes on the complementary strand (&amp;ldquo;trans&amp;rdquo; genes) influenced by TRT were involved in the disruption of host antiviral responses during AIV infection. The trans-TRT enhanced viral lethality, and TRT abolishment increased cell viability and STAT1/2 expression. The viral NS1 protein directly bound to SSU72, and degradation of SSU72 induced TRT. SSU72 overexpression reduced TRT and alleviated mouse lung injury. Our results suggest that AIVs infection induce TRT by reducing SSU72 expression, thereby impairing host immune responses, a molecular mechanism acting through the NS1-SSU72-trans-TRT-STAT1/2 axis. Thus, restoration of SSU72 expression might be a potential strategy for preventing AIV pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil-vascular interactions drive myeloperoxidase accumulation in the brain in Alzheimer&#39;s disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35331340/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35331340/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Neutrophil accumulation is a well-established feature of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and has been linked to cognitive impairment by modulating disease-relevant neuroinflammatory and vascular pathways. Neutrophils express high levels of the oxidant-generating enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), however there has been controversy regarding the cellular source and localisation of MPO in the AD brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used immunostaining and immunoassays to quantify the accumulation of neutrophils in human AD tissue microarrays and in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. We also used multiplexed immunolabelling to define the presence of NETs in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; There was an increase in neutrophils in AD brains as well as in the murine APP/PS1 model of AD. Indeed, MPO expression was almost exclusively confined to S100A8-positive neutrophils in both human AD and murine APP/PS1 brains. The vascular localisation of neutrophils in both human AD and mouse models of AD was striking and driven by enhanced neutrophil adhesion to small vessels. We also observed rare infiltrating neutrophils and deposits of MPO around plaques. Citrullinated histone H3, a marker of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), was also detected in human AD cases at these sites, indicating the presence of extracellular MPO in the vasculature. Finally, there was a reduction in the endothelial glycocalyx in AD that may be responsible for non-productive neutrophil adhesion to the vasculature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our report indicates that vascular changes may drive neutrophil adhesion and NETosis, and that neutrophil-derived MPO may lead to vascular oxidative stress and be a relevant therapeutic target in AD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Growth differentiation factor-15 preserves Klotho expression in acute kidney injury and kidney fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35337892/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35337892/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF15) is a member of the GDF subfamily with potential kidney protective functions. Here, we explored the impact of GDF15 on the expression of the kidney protective factor Klotho in models of acute kidney injury and kidney fibrosis in mice. GDF15 was the most upregulated GDF family gene in experimental toxic acute kidney injury and in kidney fibrosis transcriptomics. GDF15 function was explored in toxic acute kidney injury in genetically modified mice and following treatment with GDF15. &lt;em&gt;Gdf15&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice developed more severe toxic acute kidney injury (folic acid or cisplatin) while GDF15 overexpression or GDF15 administration were protective. Kidney expression of Klotho was more severely depressed in &lt;em&gt;Gdf15&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice and was preserved by GDF15 overexpression or GDF15 treatment. Moreover, increased plasma calcitriol levels inversely correlated with kidney Klotho across models with diverse levels of GDF15 availability. Kidney fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction was more severe in &lt;em&gt;Gdf15&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice while GDF15 overexpression decreased kidney injury and preserved Klotho expression. GDF15 increased Klotho expression in vivo in healthy mice, in cultured tubular cells, and prevented Klotho downregulation by inflammatory factors in tubular cells by preventing transcription factor NF-ĸB activation. Thus, spontaneous increased kidney expression of endogenous GDF15 is not enough to prevent kidney injury, but further increments in GDF15 are kidney protecting and preserve expression of the kidney protective factor Klotho within the kidney in acute and chronic settings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) Promotes Staphylococcus aureus-Induced Extracellular Traps Formation via the ROS-ERK Signaling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35399524/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a cytosolic DNA sensor or directly recognizes bacterial cyclic dinucleotides, which is required for the detection of microbial infection. Extracellular traps (ETs) are known to be part of the antimicrobial defense system. However, the implication of STING in ETs formation during microbial infection remains unknown. Here, we showed that STING contributed to &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;)-induced ETs formation through the ROS-ERK signaling. STING deficiency exhibited decreased cell-free DNA (cfDNA) level, reduced expression of citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), and diminished DNA colocalization with CitH3 and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Interestingly, NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoted ETs formation, accompanied by increased activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Corresponding to less ROS production, decreased ERK1/2 activation was shown in STING-/- BMDMs after &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Importantly, inhibiting the ROS-ERK signal reduced the ETs formation and the differences disappeared between WT and STING&lt;sup&gt;-/&lt;/sup&gt;- BMDMs after &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Moreover, STING&lt;sup&gt;-/&lt;/sup&gt; BMDMs exhibited significantly increased levels of extracellular bacteria compared to WT BMDMs regardless of phagocytosis. In addition, such differences disappeared after DNase I treatment. DNase I treatment also facilitated pathogen colonization without affecting the inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory factors secretion following pulmonary &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Furthermore, STING&lt;sup&gt;-/&lt;/sup&gt; mice presented decreased levels of cfDNA and CitH3, along with increased bacterial colonization compared to WT mice. Altogether, these findings highlighted that STING promoted ETs formation via the ROS-ERK signal for host defense against &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AdMSC-derived exosomes alleviate acute lung injury via transferring mitochondrial component to improve homeostasis of alveolar macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35401830/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Aberrant activation of macrophages with mitochondria dismiss was proved to be associated with pathogenesis of ALI (acute lung injury). Exosomes from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC-Exos) have been distinguished by their low immunogenicity, lack of tumorigenicity, and high clinical safety, but their role in treating ALI and the mechanism involved need to be defined. In this study, we sought to investigate whether the mitochondrial donation from AdMSC-Exos provides profound protection against LPS-induced ALI in mice, accompanied by improvement of macrophage mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice were orotracheally instilled with LPS (1 mg/kg). AdMSC-Exos were administered via the tail vein 4 h after LPS inhalation. Flow cytometry, H&amp;amp;E, Quantitative Real-Time PCR, immunofluorescence (IF), confocal microscopy imaging was conducted to investigate lung tissue inflammation and macrophage mitochondrial function. And further observe the transfer of exosomes and the effect on mitochondrial function of MH-S cells through &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; AdMSC-Exos can transfer the stem cell-derived mitochondria components to alveolar macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Likely through complementing the damaged mitochondria, AdMSC-Exos exhibited the ability to elevate the level of mtDNA, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), OXPHOS activity and ATP generation, while reliving mROS stress in LPS-challenged macrophages. Restoring mitochondrial integrity via AdMSC-Exos treatment enabled macrophages shifting to anti-inflammatory phenotype, as featured with the down-regulation of IL-1β, TNF-α and iNOS secretion and increase in production of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and Arg-1. As we depleted alveolar macrophages using clodronate liposomes, the protective role for AdMSC-Exos was largely abrogated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; AdMSC-Exos can effectively donate mitochondria component improved macrophages mitochondrial integrity and oxidative phosphorylation level, leading to the resumption of metabolic and immune homeostasis of airway macrophages and mitigating lung inflammatory pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epithelial LIF signaling limits apoptosis and lung injury during bacterial pneumonia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During bacterial pneumonia, alveolar epithelial cells are critical for maintaining gas exchange and providing antimicrobial as well as pro-immune properties. We previously demonstrated that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an IL-6 family cytokine, is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATII) and is critical for tissue protection during bacterial pneumonia. However, the target cells and mechanisms of LIF-mediated protection remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that antibody-induced LIF blockade remodels the lung epithelial transcriptome in association with increased apoptosis. Based on these data, we performed pneumonia studies using a novel mouse model in which LIFR (the unique receptor for LIF) is absent in lung epithelium. Although LIFR is expressed on the surface of epithelial cells, its absence only minimally contributed to tissue protection during pneumonia. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) was conducted to identify adult murine lung cell types most prominently expressing &lt;em&gt;Lifr&lt;/em&gt;, revealing endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and ATIIs as major sources of &lt;em&gt;Lifr&lt;/em&gt;. Sequencing data indicated that ATII cells were significantly impacted by pneumonia, with additional differences observed in response to LIF neutralization, including but not limited to gene programs related to cell death, injury, and inflammation. Overall, our data suggest that LIF signaling on epithelial cells alters responses in this cell type during pneumonia. However, our results also suggest separate and perhaps more prominent roles of LIFR in other cell types, such as endothelial cells or mesenchymal cells, which provide grounds for future investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histone Extraction from Human Articular Cartilage for the Study of Epigenetic Regulation in Osteoarthritis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease that affects articular cartilage, causing its degeneration. Although OA is one of the most prevalent pathologies globally, there are no definitive treatments available. Recently, research has focused on elucidating the complex interplay that takes place between inflammatory processes and epigenetic regulation, showing that histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) can exert a pronounced effect on the expression of OA-related genes. OA chondrocytes enhance the production of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), which are epigenetically regulated. These cytokines upregulate the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases, which promote the extracellular matrix (ECM) destruction. This motivates the study of histone PTMs to investigate the epigenetic regulation of proinflammatory molecules, but the absence of specific protocols to extract histones from human articular cartilage has complicated this task. The lack of effective methods can be explained by the structural complexity and low cellularity of this tissue, which are responsible for the biomechanical properties that allow the movement of the joint but also complicate histone isolation. Here, we provide a histone extraction procedure specifically adapted for cryopreserved human articular cartilage that can be useful to understand epigenetic regulation in OA and accelerate the search for novel strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ZDHHC18 negatively regulates cGAS-mediated innate immunity through palmitoylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35438208/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-stranded DNA is recognized as a danger signal by cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS), triggering innate immune responses. Palmitoylation is an important post-translational modification (PTM) catalyzed by DHHC-palmitoyl transferases, which participate in the regulation of diverse biological processes. However, whether palmitoylation regulates cGAS function has not yet been explored. Here, we found that palmitoylation of cGAS at C474 restricted its enzymatic activity in the presence of double-stranded DNA. cGAS palmitoylation was catalyzed mainly by the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC18 and double-stranded DNA promoted this modification. Mechanistically, palmitoylation of cGAS reduced the interaction between cGAS and double-stranded DNA, further inhibiting cGAS dimerization. Consistently, ZDHHC18 negatively regulated cGAS activation in human and mouse cell lines. In a more biologically relevant model system, Zdhhc18-deficient mice were found to be resistant to infection by DNA viruses, in agreement with the observation that ZDHHC18 negatively regulated cGAS mediated innate immune responses in human and mouse primary cells. In summary, the negative role of ZDHHC18-mediated cGAS palmitoylation may be a novel regulatory mechanism in the fine-tuning of innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Combined Transcriptomic and Proteomic Approach to Reveal the Effect of Mogroside V on OVA-Induced Pulmonary Inflammation in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35371026/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mogroside V is a bioactive ingredient extracted from the natural food Siraitia grosvenorii which possesses functions that stimulate lung humidification and cough relief activities, but its underlying mechanisms were rarely studied. To estimate its potential protective effect on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced pulmonary inflammation and understand its system-wide mechanism, integrated omics was applied in this study. Mogroside V effectively reduced the levels of IgE, TNF-α, and IL-5 in OVA-induced mice. The results of RNA-seq and data-independent acquisition proteomics approach revealed that 944 genes and 341 proteins were differentially expressed in the normal control group (NC) and ovalbumin-induced control group (OC) and 449 genes and 259 proteins were differentially expressed between the OC and the group treated with 50 mg/kg mogroside V (MV). After a combined analysis of the transcriptome and the proteome, 93 major pathways were screened, and we discovered that mogroside V exerts an anti-inflammation effect in the lung via NF-κB and JAK-STAT, both of which are among the signaling pathways mentioned above. In addition, we found that the key regulatory molecules (Igha, Ighg1, NF-κB, Jak1, and Stat1) in the two pathways were activated in inflammation and inhibited by mogroside V. Thus, mogroside V may be the main bioactivity component in S. grosvenorii that exerts lung humidification and cough relief effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-22 Plays a Dual Role in the Amniotic Cavity: Tissue Injury and Host Defense against Microbes in Preterm Labor</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35304419/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IL-22 is a multifaceted cytokine with both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions that is implicated in multiple pathologies. However, the role of IL-22 in maternal-fetal immunity in late gestation is poorly understood. In this study, we first showed that IL-22&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells coexpressing retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (ROR-γt) are enriched at the human maternal-fetal interface of women with preterm labor and birth, which was confirmed by in silico analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. T cell activation leading to preterm birth in mice was preceded by a surge in IL-22 in the maternal circulation and amniotic cavity; however, systemic administration of IL-22 in mice did not induce adverse perinatal outcomes. Next, using an ex vivo human system, we showed that IL-22 can cross from the choriodecidua to the intra-amniotic space, where its receptors (&lt;em&gt;Il22ra1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il10rb&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Il22ra2&lt;/em&gt;) are highly expressed by murine gestational and fetal tissues in late pregnancy. Importantly, amniotic fluid concentrations of IL-22 were elevated in women with sterile or microbial intra-amniotic inflammation, suggesting a dual role for this cytokine. The intra-amniotic administration of IL-22 alone shortened gestation and caused neonatal death in mice, with the latter outcome involving lung maturation and inflammation. IL-22 plays a role in host response by participating in the intra-amniotic inflammatory milieu preceding &lt;em&gt;Ureaplasma parvum&lt;/em&gt;-induced preterm birth in mice, which was rescued by the deficiency of IL-22. Collectively, these data show that IL-22 alone is capable of causing fetal injury leading to neonatal death and can participate in host defense against microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity leading to preterm labor and birth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freshwater environmental antibiotic pollution is becoming more severe because of the irregular use of sulfonamide antibiotics. Sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) is a kind of antibiotic that can cause harm to the urinary systems of organisms. However, the toxic impacts of environment-related concentrations of antibiotics in fish have not been thoroughly studied. Lycopene (LYC) has the property of alleviating antibiotic toxicity by diminishing oxidative stress and inflammation. This investigation is intended to examine the instrument of the mitigative part of LYC on SMZ-caused renal inflammatory injury in grass carp. Grass carp were born with SMZ (0. 3 μg L-1) and LYC (10 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days. Serum was used to measure creatinine (CREA) and urea nitrogen (BUN) contents; what is more, kidneys were used to measure histological structure, oxidative stress indicators, relative expressions of cytokines, and inflammatory factors. We found that SMZ exposure significantly increased oxidative stress, characterized by decreased catalase activity (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). In addition, inflammation-related factors: interleukin (IL-18, IL-6, and IL-1β), an apoptotic speck-containing protein with a card (ASC), NOD-like receptor protein3 (NLRP3), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-1 (caspase-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and nuclear factor-activated B cells (NF-κB) expression increased significantly contrasted with those control group. Inflammatory reactions and ultrastructural changes accompany. LYC administration alleviated the changes mentioned above. In conclusion, In conclusion, these results suggest a protective effect of LYC dietary supplements against kidney damage caused by SMZ. LYC is expected to prevent and treat oxidative stress and chronic inflammation caused by antibiotics as a critical component in the fish breeding diet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-6 Prevents Lung Macrophage Death and Lung Inflammation Injury by Inhibiting GSDME- and GSDMD-Mediated Pyroptosis during Pneumococcal Pneumosepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35297653/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumococcal pneumonia has been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout human history. Failing to control pneumococcal pneumonia and resolve ongoing inflammation in a host can cause sepsis, namely pneumococcal pneumosepsis, and death ensues. Few theories have suggested an optimally therapeutic option for this infectious disease. The interleukin-6 (IL-6, a cytokine featuring pleiotropic activity) theory, proposed here, implies that IL-6 acts as a protector against pneumococcal pneumosepsis. IL-6 prevents lung macrophage death and lung inflammation injury by inhibiting a caspase-3-GSDME-mediated switch from apoptosis to pyroptosis and inhibiting caspase-1-GSDMD-mediated classic pyroptosis during pneumococcal pneumosepsis. Thus, IL-6 is an important determinant for controlling bacterial invasion and a homeostatic coordinator of pneumococcal pneumosepsis. This study clarifies a novel mechanism of occurrence and development of pneumonia and secondary sepsis following a Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. It is important for the early identification and treatment of pneumococcal pneumosepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Immune cell phenotypic linkage with colorectal cancer and liver metastasis depicted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Malignancy-associated exhausted and regulatory T cells show diverse TCR dependency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPP1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; TAMs are malignancy associated and are linked to liver metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DCs are mainly associated with host organ except a malignancy-associated DC3 subset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumor microenvironment (TME) is connected to immunotherapy responses, but it remains unclear how cancer cells and host tissues differentially influence the immune composition within TME. Here, we performed single-cell analyses for autologous samples from liver metastasized colorectal cancer to disentangle factors shaping TME. By aligning CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells across different tissues, we classified exhausted CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells (Texs) and activated regulatory T cells as M-type, whose phenotypes were associated with the malignancy, while natural killer and mucosal-associated invariant T cells were defined as N-type, whose phenotypes were associated with the niche. T cell receptor sharing between Texs in primary and metastatic tumors implicated the presence of common peripheral non-exhausted precursors. For myeloid cells, a subset of dendritic cells (DC3s) and SPP1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages were M-type, and the latter were predominant in liver metastasis, indicating its pro-metastasis role. Our analyses bridge immune phenotypes of primary and metastatic tumors, thereby helping to understand the tumor-specific contexture and identify the pro-metastasis components.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts rely on the innate immune system to clear pathogens in response to infection. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns bind to innate immune receptors and engage activation of downstream signaling to initiate a host immune response to fight infection. A key component of this innate response is programmed cell death. Recent work has highlighted significant cross-talk and functional redundancy between cell death pathways, leading to the discovery of PANoptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death pathway dependent on PANoptosomes, which are innate immune danger-sensing complexes that activate inflammatory cell death and contain caspases with or without inflammasome components and receptor interacting protein homotypic interaction motif-containing proteins. Although PANoptosis has been characterized in response to a growing number of pathogens, inflammatory diseases, and cancer, its role and the functional consequences of PANoptotic component modulation during NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4) activation by &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; infection remain unknown. In this study, we show that P. aeruginosa can induce PANoptosis in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Only the combined deletion of caspase-1, -11, -8, and RIPK3 protected mouse BMDMs from cell death. Moreover, we showed that PANoptotic components act in a compensatory manner; in the absence of NAIP5 and NLRC4 during P. aeruginosa challenge, activation of caspase-1, -3, -7, and -8 was reduced, whereas alternative cell death molecules such as RIPK1 and MLKL were activated in mouse BMDMs. Taken together, these data highlight the extensive cross-talk between cell death signaling molecules and showcase the plasticity of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanoformulation of a carbon monoxide releasing molecule protects against cyclosporin A-induced nephrotoxicity and renal fibrosis via the suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated TGF-β/Smad pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35304324/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclosporin A (CsA) induced nephrotoxicity i.e., renal fibrosis is a critical clinical problem in renal transplant patients, in which chronic inflammatory response is the major cause. Previously, we developed a nano-drug delivery system for carbon monoxide (CO), a multi-functional gaseous molecule with a potent anti-inflammatory effect, i.e., SMA/CORM2, which showed therapeutic potential in several inflammatory disease models. Accordingly, in this study, we explored the potential and usefulness of SMA/CORM2 on CsA induced renal fibrosis. When mice were exposed to CsA for 4 weeks, severe injuries in the kidney as revealed by decreased kidney function and histological examination, and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as renal fibrosis along with the upregulation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)/Smad signaling molecule were observed, whereas SMA/CORM2 (1 mg/kg) treatment remarkably ameliorated the inflammatory injury and fibrosis in the kidney. CO is the major effector molecule of SMA/CORM2 which significantly suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, and induced the downregulation of TGFβ/Smad signaling. Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome by its inhibitor MCC950 also similarly decreased TGFβ/Smad expression and subsequently improved kidney injury and renal fibrosis, suggesting SMA/CORM2 induced suppression of TGFβ/Smad signaling and renal signaling via an NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pathway. Compared to native CORM2, SMA/CORM2 exhibited better therapeutic/preventive effects owing to its superior water-solubility and bioavailability. These findings strongly indicated the applicability of SMA/CORM2 as an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect-based nanomedicine for CsA induced renal fibrosis as well as other inflammatory diseases. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important gaseous signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in the maintenance of homeostasis. Because of its versatile functions, it exhibits the potential as the target molecule for many diseases, including inflammatory diseases and cancer. The development of stable and disease-targeted delivery systems of CO is thus of interest and importance. Previously we developed a nano micellar CO donor SMA/CORM2 which shows superior bioavailability and therapeutic potential in many inflammatory disease models. We reported here, SMA/CORM2, through controlled release of CO, greatly ameliorated CsA-induced renal fibrosis via suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated TGF-β/Smad pathway. These findings suggest a new anti-inflammatory mechanism of CO, which also provides a new approach for controlling CsA-induced nephrotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Syk Facilitates Influenza A Virus Replication by Restraining Innate Immunity at the Late Stage of Viral Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35293768/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has recently come forth as a critical regulator of innate immune response. Previous studies identify Syk as a key kinase for STAT1 activation at the early stage of influenza A virus (IAV) infection that is involved in initial antiviral immunity. However, the involvement of Syk in host antiviral immunity during the late phase of IAV infection and its effect on pathogenesis of the virus remain unknown. Here, we found through time course studies that Syk restrained antiviral immune response at the late stage of IAV infection, thereby promoting viral replication. Depletion of Syk suppressed IAV replication &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, whereas ectopic expression of Syk facilitated viral replication. Moreover, Syk-deficient mice were employed, and we observed that knockout of Syk rendered mice more resistant to IAV infection, as evidenced by a lower degree of lung injury, slower body weight loss, and an increased survival rate of Syk knockout mice challenged with IAV. Furthermore, we revealed that Syk repressed the interferon response at the late stage of viral infection. Loss of Syk potentiated the expression of type I and III interferons in both Syk-depleted cells and mice. Mechanistically, Syk interacted with TBK1 and modulated its phosphorylation status, thereby impeding TBK1 activation and restraining innate immune signaling that governs interferon response. Together, these findings unveil a role of Syk in temporally regulating host antiviral immunity and advance our understanding of complicated mechanisms underlying regulation of innate immunity against viral invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate immunity must be tightly controlled to eliminate invading pathogens while avoiding autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. Syk is essential for STAT1 activation at the early stage of IAV infection, which is critical for initial antiviral responses. Surprisingly, here a time course study showed that Syk suppressed innate immunity during late phases of IAV infection and thereby promoted IAV replication. Syk deficiency enhanced the expression of type I and III interferons, inhibited IAV replication, and rendered mice more resistant to IAV infection. Syk impaired innate immune signaling through impeding TBK1 activation. These data reveal that Syk participates in the initiation of antiviral defense against IAV infection and simultaneously contributes to the restriction of innate immunity at the late stage of viral infection, suggesting that Syk serves a dual function in regulating antiviral responses. This finding provides new insights into complicated mechanisms underlying interaction between virus and host immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Delicate regulation of IL-1β-mediated inflammation by cyclophilin A</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35294882/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CypA facilitates pro-IL-1β processing in an ATP-dependent manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CypA degrades redundant pro-IL-1β&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CypA exacerbates lung injury by enhancing cytokine production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CypA promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to facilitate lung repair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inflammatory response is tightly regulated, but its regulatory principles are still incompletely understood. Cyclophilin A (CypA) has long been considered as a pro-inflammatory factor. Here, we discover how CypA precisely regulates interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-mediated inflammatory responses. In lipopolysaccharide-treated mice, CypA deficiency initially inhibits and then promotes lung inflammation, which is closely related to IL-1β production. Mechanistically, CypA not only facilitates pro-IL-1β processing by increasing Smurf1-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination in an ATP-dependent manner but also accelerates pro-IL-1β degradation, depending on Smurf1-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination. Moreover, in IL-1β-treated mice, CypA exacerbates lung injury by enhancing cytokine production. It also upregulates the ILK/AKT pathway by inhibiting Cyld-mediated K63-linked ILK deubiquitination, which promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to facilitate lung repair. Collectively, CypA promotes inflammation activation by increasing IL-1β production and then promotes inflammation resolution by enhancing redundant pro-IL-1β degradation and IL-1β-induced EMT, indicating the complex and delicate regulation of inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Early diagnosis of breast cancer lung metastasis by nanoprobe-based luminescence imaging of the pre-metastatic niche</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35292019/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Early detection of breast cancer lung metastasis remains highly challenging, due to few metastatic cancer cells at an early stage. Herein we propose a new strategy for early diagnosis of lung metastasis of breast cancer by luminescence imaging of pulmonary neutrophil infiltration via self-illuminating nanoprobes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Luminescent nanoparticles (LAD NPs) were engineered using a biocompatible, neutrophil-responsive self-illuminating cyclodextrin material and an aggregation-induced emission agent. The chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) effect and luminescence properties of LAD NPs were fully characterized. Using mouse peritoneal neutrophils, in vitro luminescence properties of LAD NPs were thoroughly examined. In vivo luminescence imaging and correlation analyses were performed in mice inoculated with 4T1 cancer cells. Moreover, an active targeting nanoprobe was developed by surface decoration of LAD NPs with a neutrophil-targeting peptide, which was also systemically evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; LAD NPs can generate long-wavelength and persistent luminescence due to the CRET effect. In a mouse model of 4T1 breast cancer lung metastasis, we found desirable correlation between neutrophils and tumor cells in the lungs, demonstrating the effectiveness of early imaging of the pre-metastatic niche by the newly developed LAD NPs. The active targeting nanoprobe showed further enhanced luminescence imaging capability for early detection of pulmonary metastasis. Notably, the targeting nanoprobe-based luminescence imaging strategy remarkably outperformed PET/CT imaging modalities in the examined mouse model. Also, preliminary tests demonstrated good safety of LAD NPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The neutrophil-targeting imaging strategy based on newly developed luminescence nanoparticles can serve as a promising modality for early diagnosis of lung metastasis of breast cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>L-plastin enhances NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35294888/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macrophages require L-plastin for optimal NLRP3 inflammasome activation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPL stabilizes Pyk2 kinase interaction with ASC in NLRP3 assembly to link podosomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podosome-mediated mechanotransduction in inflammasome signaling requires L-plastin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L-plastin supports bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis via NLRP3 pathway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophage adhesion and stretching have been shown to induce interleukin (IL)-1β production, but the mechanism of this mechanotransduction remains unclear. Here we specify the molecular link between mechanical tension on tissue-resident macrophages and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which governs IL-1β production. NLRP3 activation enhances antimicrobial defense, but excessive NLRP3 activity causes inflammatory tissue damage in conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. We find that the actin-bundling protein L-plastin (LPL) significantly enhances NLRP3 assembly. Specifically, LPL enables apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC) oligomerization during NLRP3 assembly by stabilizing ASC interactions with the kinase Pyk2, a component of cell-surface adhesive structures called podosomes. Upon treatment with exogenous NLRP3 activators, lung-resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) lacking LPL exhibit reduced caspase-1 activity, IL-1β cleavage, and gasdermin-D processing. &lt;em&gt;LPL&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice display resistance to bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis. These findings identify the LPL-Pyk2-ASC pathway as a target for modulation in NLRP3-mediated inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fengreqing Oral Liquid Exerts Anti-Inflammatory Effects by Promoting Apoptosis and Inhibiting PI3K/AKT and NF-κB Signaling Pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35370749/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fengreqing oral liquid (FOL), a Chinese patent drug frequently used in clinical practice in China, is effective in treating inflammatory diseases of the upper respiratory tract such as colds and flu. However, its anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of FOL and its mechanisms on PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells were explored, as well as the regulatory effect of FOL on apoptosis. In addition, the potential of FOL for the treatment of acute lung injury was explored in LPS-induced ALI mice. The results showed that treatment with FOL significantly reduced the levels of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in the supernatant of LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, and also significantly reduced the phosphorylated protein levels of PI3K and AKT in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and also protein levels of NF-κB p50, phosphorylated NF-κB p65, and IκBα in the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, the results showed that FOL induced apoptosis in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells at the level of 80%-90%, and significantly increased the protein expression levels of the pro-apoptotic Bax and cleaved-caspase-3. In LPS-induced ALI mice, FOL administration showed inhibition of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and decreased protein expression levels of PI3K, AKT, NF-κB p50, and NF-κB p65, and elevated protein expression levels of Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 significantly. These results suggest that FOL may exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote apoptosis and leading to attenuated activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Injury-induced inflammatory signaling and hematopoiesis in Drosophila</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35286208/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explore mechanisms by which stress caused by acute injury affects blood cell development and inflammatory response in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;. Similar to their mammalian myeloid counterparts, these cells are predisposed to sense and react to sterile injury at distant sites. Upon sterile injury, a breach of epidermis sets up a reactive oxygen species-based signal that bypasses the pathogen-sensing apparatus of septic immune challenge, but merges downstream to activate Toll. A number of autonomous and nonautonomous signaling pathways follow in a sequence and are mapped temporally by the appearance of their corresponding molecular phenotypes. A cell-type that fights deposited parasitic wasp eggs appears with sterile injury without the immune challenge, perhaps in anticipation, because in nature injury is usually followed by infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory response in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; to sterile (axenic) injury in embryos and adults has received some attention in recent years, and most concentrate on the events at the injury site. Here we focus on the effect sterile injury has on the hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, and the circulating blood cells in the larva, the developmental stage at which major events of hematopoiesis are evident. In mammals, injury activates Toll-like receptor/NF-κB signaling in macrophages, which then express and secrete secondary, proinflammatory cytokines. In &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; larvae, distal puncture injury of the body wall epidermis causes a rapid activation of Toll and Jun kinase (JNK) signaling throughout the hematopoietic system and the differentiation of a unique blood cell type, the lamellocyte. Furthermore, we find that Toll and JNK signaling are coupled in their activation. Secondary to this Toll/JNK response, a cytokine, Upd3, is induced as a Toll pathway transcriptional target, which then promotes JAK/STAT signaling within the blood cells. Toll and JAK/STAT signaling are required for the emergence of the injury-induced lamellocytes. This is akin to the derivation of specialized macrophages in mammalian systems. Upstream, at the injury site, a Duox- and peroxide-dependent signal causes the activation of the proteases Grass and SPE, needed for the activation of the Toll-ligand Spz, but microbial sensors or the proteases most closely associated with them during septic injury are not involved in the axenic inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The arginine methyltransferase PRMT7 promotes extravasation of monocytes resulting in tissue injury in COPD</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35288557/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extravasation of monocytes into tissue and to the site of injury is a fundamental immunological process, which requires rapid responses via post translational modifications (PTM) of proteins. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) is an epigenetic factor that has the capacity to mono-methylate histones on arginine residues. Here we show that in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, PRMT7 expression is elevated in the lung tissue and localized to the macrophages. In mouse models of COPD, lung fibrosis and skin injury, reduced expression of PRMT7 associates with decreased recruitment of monocytes to the site of injury and hence less severe symptoms. Mechanistically, activation of NF-κB/RelA in monocytes induces PRMT7 transcription and consequential mono-methylation of histones at the regulatory elements of RAP1A, which leads to increased transcription of this gene that is responsible for adhesion and migration of monocytes. Persistent monocyte-derived macrophage accumulation leads to ALOX5 over-expression and accumulation of its metabolite LTB4, which triggers expression of ACSL4 a ferroptosis promoting gene in lung epithelial cells. Conclusively, inhibition of arginine mono-methylation might offer targeted intervention in monocyte-driven inflammatory conditions that lead to extensive tissue damage if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Actin-related protein 2/3 complex regulates neutrophil extracellular trap expulsion and lung damage in abdominal sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35272488/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is a key feature in sepsis. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of the actin cytoskeleton in regulating the expulsion of NETs. Actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp 2/3) complex is an important regulator of F-actin polymerization. Coincubation with CK666, a specific Arp 2/3 inhibitor, decreased 12-phorbol 13-myristate acetate-induced NET formation in vitro. CK666 not only abolished F-actin polymerization but also caused intracellular retention of NETs. Inhibition of Arp 2/3 reduced NET formation on circulating neutrophils and in the bronchoalveolar space in mice undergoing cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Notably, treatment with CK666 attenuated CLP-induced neutrophil recruitment, edema formation, and tissue damage in the lungs. Moreover, Arp 2/3 inhibition decreased levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL-1) and interleukin-6 in the lung and plasma of septic animals. Taken together, this study shows that expulsion of NETs is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton and that inhibition of Arp 2/3-dependent F-actin polymerization not only decreases NET formation but also protects against pathological inflammation and tissue damage in septic lung injury. Thus, we suggest that targeting NET release is a novel and useful way to ameliorate lung damage in abdominal sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitination is an important reversible post-translational modification. Many viruses hijack the host ubiquitin system to enhance self-replication. In the present study, we found that Avibirnavirus VP3 protein was ubiquitinated during infection and supported virus replication by ubiquitination. Mass spectrometry and mutation analysis showed that VP3 was ubiquitinated at residues K73, K135, K158, K193, and K219. Virus rescue showed that ubiquitination at sites K73, K193, and K219 on VP3 could enhance the replication abilities of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), and that K135 was essential for virus survival. Binding of the zinc finger domain of TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor 6) to VP3 mediated K11- and K33-linked ubiquitination of VP3, which promoted its nuclear accumulation to facilitate virus replication. Additionally, VP3 could inhibit TRAF6-mediated NFKB/NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) activation and IFNB/IFN-β (interferon beta) production to evade host innate immunity by inducing TRAF6 autophagic degradation in an SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1)-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrated a macroautophagic/autophagic mechanism by which Avibirnavirus protein VP3 blocked NFKB-mediated IFNB production by targeting TRAF6 during virus infection, and provided a potential drug target for virus infection control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) are heterogeneous intestinal diseases that threaten the health of an increasing number of individuals as their lifestyles become westernized. New insights have been discovered with the development of various omics techniques, revealing that gut-microbiota-derived metabolites play important roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and modulating the progression of intestinal diseases from both metabolic and immunological perspectives. Clinical metagenomic and metabolomic studies have revealed links between microbial bile acid (BA) metabolism and IBD and CRC progression. Several BA-derived metabolites were recently been demonstrated to play a role in intestinal immunity, providing fresh insights into how BAs affect the course of IBD and CRC. In this review, we discuss recent studies on the involvement of gut microbiota-derived BAs in intestinal immunity, inflammation, and tumorigenesis along with human omics data to provide prospective insights into future prevention and treatment of IBD and CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL10 trains macrophage profibrotic function after lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35107021/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cx3cr1+ monocyte-derived macrophages (moMacs) are recruited to tissues after injury and are known to have profibrotic effects, but the cell-cell interactions and specific pathways that regulate this polarization and function are incompletely understood. Here we investigate the role of moMac-derived &lt;em&gt;Pdgfa&lt;/em&gt; in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Deletion of Pdgfa with &lt;em&gt;Cx3cr1-CreERT2&lt;/em&gt; decreased bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Among a panel of in vitro macrophage polarizing stimuli, robust induction of Pdgfa was noted with IL10 in both mouse and human moMacs. Likewise, analysis of single-cell data revealed high expression of the receptor &lt;em&gt;IL10RA&lt;/em&gt; in moMacs from human fibrotic lungs. Studies with &lt;em&gt;IL10-GFP&lt;/em&gt; mice revealed that IL10-expressing cells were increased after injury in mice and colocalized with moMacs. Notably, deletion of &lt;em&gt;IL10ra&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Csf1r-Cre:IL10ra&lt;/em&gt; fl/fl mice decreased both &lt;em&gt;Pdgfa&lt;/em&gt; expression in moMacs and lung fibrosis. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel, IL10-dependent mechanism of macrophage polarization leading to fibroblast activation after injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Optimized Two-Herb Chinese Food as Medicine Formula Reduces Cisplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity in the Treatment of Lung Cancer in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35355712/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy is considered a most effective way to treat cancer. However, it is very common that chemotherapy causes unbearable mental and physical side effects to cancer patients, which ultimately reduces the patients&amp;rsquo; confidence of overcoming diseases and compromises the treatment of chemotherapy. Cisplatin (DDP), a widely used anticancer agent for various types of cancers, also damages nontumor cells and tissues, which are mostly related to the activation of the inflammation pathway. Previously, we have discovered a few rational formulas of food as medicine materials that reduced systemic inflammation in &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; models. Hence, this study reports the ability of an optimized traditional Chinese anti-inflammatory formulation capable of synergizing the antitumor effect of DDP &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. More significantly, by formulation of two anti-inflammatory herbal medicine, the &lt;em&gt;Chrysanthemum&lt;/em&gt; × &lt;em&gt;morifolium&lt;/em&gt; (Ramat.) Hemsl [Asteraceae] and &lt;em&gt;Lonicera japonica&lt;/em&gt; Thunb [Caprifoliaceae] with a mediator &lt;em&gt;Glycyrrhiza uralensis&lt;/em&gt; Fisch. ex DC [Fabaceae], a best formula relieved the kidney damage imposed by DDP. Treatments of various combinations of major chemical components of the three herbs also exhibited a similar trend for lowering the DDP-induced nephrotoxicity; however, contrary to that of the formula of herbal extracts, all chemical formulas could not recover the body weight and food intake of the tumor-bearing mice treated by DDP. Our findings suggested that the therapeutic index of DDP-based chemotherapy was able to be improved by minimizing toxicities from the two-herb formula to inhibit the inflammation in mouse tumor models and DDP-induced acute kidney injury mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The RNA helicase DHX16 recognizes specific viral RNA to trigger RIG-I-dependent innate antiviral immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35263596/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An unanchored ubiquitin-binding screen links DHX16 to innate immune recognition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DHX16 amplifies RIG-I-dependent innate antiviral immune responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TRIM6 promotes association of unanchored K48-poly-Ub with DHX16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DHX16 acts as a pattern recognition receptor sensing splicing signals in vRNA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferons (IFN-I) are essential to establish antiviral innate immunity. Unanchored (or free) polyubiquitin (poly-Ub) has been shown to regulate IFN-I responses. However, few unanchored poly-Ub interactors are known. To identify factors regulated by unanchored poly-Ub in a physiological setting, we developed an approach to isolate unanchored poly-Ub from lung tissue. We identified the RNA helicase DHX16 as a potential pattern recognition receptor (PRR). Silencing of DHX16 in cells and in vivo diminished IFN-I responses against influenza virus. These effects extended to members of other virus families, including Zika and SARS-CoV-2. DHX16-dependent IFN-I production requires RIG-I and unanchored K48-poly-Ub synthesized by the E3-Ub ligase TRIM6. DHX16 recognizes a signal in influenza RNA segments that undergo splicing and requires its RNA helicase motif for direct, high-affinity interactions with specific viral RNAs. Our study establishes DHX16 as a PRR that partners with RIG-I for optimal activation of antiviral immunity requiring unanchored poly-Ub.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The suppressive effects of Mer inhibition on inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis of LPS-induced ALI/ARDS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35258998/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathogenesis of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has not yet been fully elucidated. Growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) has marked effects on hemostasis and reduces inflammation through its interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases of the TAM family: Tyro3, Axl, and Mer. Here, we found that plasma concentrations of Gas6 and soluble Mer were greater in patients with severe sepsis or septic ALI/ARDS compared with those in normal healthy donors. To determine whether the Gas6-Mer axis was critical in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS, we investigated the effects of intravenous administration of the selective Mer inhibitor UNC2250 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mouse models subjected to inhalation of LPS. UNC2250 markedly inhibited the infiltration into the lungs of neutrophils and monocytes with increased amounts of Gas6 and Mer proteins, severe lung damage, and increased amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in LPS-induced ALI in mice. In human pulmonary aortic endothelial cells, LPS induced decreases in the amounts of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, thrombomodulin, and vascular endothelial-cadherin, which was blocked by treatment with UNC2250. UNC2250 also inhibited the LPS-dependent increases in cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, a human neutrophil-like cell line, and RAW264.7 cells, a mouse monocyte/macrophage cell line. These data provide insights into the potential multiple beneficial effects of the Mer inhibitor UNC2250 as a therapeutic reagent to treat inflammatory responses in ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Itaconate inhibits TET DNA dioxygenases to dampen inflammatory responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35256775/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the most induced genes in activated macrophages, immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) encodes a mitochondrial metabolic enzyme catalysing the production of itaconic acid (ITA). Although ITA has an anti-inflammatory property, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we show that ITA is a potent inhibitor of the TET-family DNA dioxygenases. ITA binds to the same site on TET2 as the co-substrate α-ketoglutarate, inhibiting TET2 catalytic activity. Lipopolysaccharide treatment, which induces Irg1 expression and ITA accumulation, inhibits Tet activity in macrophages. Transcriptome analysis reveals that TET2 is a major target of ITA in suppressing lipopolysaccharide-induced genes, including those regulated by the NF-κB and STAT signalling pathways. In vivo, ITA decreases the levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced acute pulmonary oedema as well as lung and liver injury, and protects mice against lethal endotoxaemia, depending on the catalytic activity of Tet2. Our study thus identifies ITA as an immune modulatory metabolite that selectively inhibits TET enzymes to dampen the inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Osteopontin aggravates acute lung injury in influenza virus infection by promoting macrophages necroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35246529/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) can trigger pulmonary inflammation and lung damage. Osteopontin (OPN) is an essential regulator of cell death and immunity. However, the role and underlying mechanism of OPN in cell death in IAV-induced pulmonary injury remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that OPN-deficient (OPN-/-) mice were insensitive to IAV, exhibiting decreased viral loads and attenuated lung injury after IAV infection compared to those in wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, macrophage necroptosis was significantly reduced in OPN-/- mice infected with IAV compared to that in infected WT mice. OPN increased the expression of necroptosis-related genes and exacerbated macrophage necroptosis in IAV-infected THP1 cells. Notably, adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or OPN-/- BMDMs into mice restored resistance to influenza infection, and the rescue effect of OPN-/- BMDMs was better than that of WT BMDMs. Collectively, these results suggest that OPN deficiency in macrophages reduces necroptosis, which leads to a decrease in viral titers and protects against IAV infection. Therefore, OPN is a potential target for the treatment of IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The TRRAP transcription cofactor represses interferon-stimulated genes in colorectal cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35244540/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcription is essential for cells to respond to signaling cues and involves factors with multiple distinct activities. One such factor, TRRAP, functions as part of two large complexes, SAGA and TIP60, which have crucial roles during transcription activation. Structurally, TRRAP belongs to the phosphoinositide 3 kinase-related kinases (PIKK) family but is the only member classified as a pseudokinase. Recent studies established that a dedicated HSP90 co-chaperone, the triple T (TTT) complex, is essential for PIKK stabilization and activity. Here, using endogenous auxin-inducible degron alleles, we show that the TTT subunit TELO2 promotes TRRAP assembly into SAGA and TIP60 in human colorectal cancer cells (CRCs). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that TELO2 contributes to TRRAP regulatory roles in CRC cells, most notably of MYC target genes. Surprisingly, TELO2 and TRRAP depletion also induced the expression of type I interferon genes. Using a combination of nascent RNA, antibody-targeted chromatin profiling (CUT&amp;amp;RUN), ChIP, and kinetic analyses, we propose a model by which TRRAP directly represses the transcription of &lt;em&gt;IRF9&lt;/em&gt;, which encodes a master regulator of interferon-stimulated genes. We have therefore uncovered an unexpected transcriptional repressor role for TRRAP, which we propose contributes to its tumorigenic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acute lung inflammation induced by zinc oxide nanoparticles: Evolution and intervention via NRF2 activator</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) are widely used worldwide. Human inhalation exposure to ZnONPs induces acute lung inflammation (ALI); however, the characteristics and therapeutic targets of ALI are unclear. In this study, female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a single intratracheal instillation of 20 μg of ZnONPs. Increased lung malondialdehyde levels and decreased total antioxidant capacity at 6 h, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at 1 day (d) post treatment were observed. A significant inflammatory response was observed at 3 d and 7 d, as evidenced by increased leukocyte numbers and total protein concentration in BALF, and histological abnormalities. Pulmonary NRF2 signaling was significantly activated at 3 d post treatment. To investigate a protective role of NRF2 activator against ZnONP-induced ALI, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-imidazolide (CDDO-Im) (2 mg/kg) 1 d before and 1 d after ZnONPs treatment. CDDO-Im significantly decreased leukocyte numbers and total protein concentration in BALF and pulmonary inflammatory gene expression, and ameliorated histopathological abnormalities induced by ZnONPs. Collectively, the present study indicates that ZnONPs exposure leads to oxidative stress, cell injury and inflammation in the lung successively. Moreover, the NRF2 activator protects against ZnONPs-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proinflammatory cytokines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and renal carcinoma. However, effective cytokine therapy requires high-dose infusions that can result in antidrug antibodies and/or systemic side effects that limit long-term benefits. To overcome these limitations, we developed a clinically translatable cytokine delivery platform composed of polymer-encapsulated human ARPE-19 (RPE) cells that produce natural cytokines. Tumor-adjacent administration of these capsules demonstrated predictable dose modulation with spatial and temporal control and enabled peritoneal cancer immunotherapy without systemic toxicities. Interleukin-2 (IL2)-producing cytokine factory treatment eradicated peritoneal tumors in ovarian and colorectal mouse models. Furthermore, computational pharmacokinetic modeling predicts clinical translatability to humans. Notably, this platform elicited T cell responses in NHPs, consistent with reported biomarkers of treatment efficacy without toxicity. Combined, our findings demonstrate the safety and efficacy of IL2 cytokine factories in preclinical animal models and provide rationale for future clinical testing in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High Mobility Group Box 1: Biological Functions and Relevance in Oxidative Stress Related Chronic Diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35269471/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1970s, a group of non-histone nuclear proteins with high electrophoretic mobility was discovered and named high-mobility group (HMG) proteins. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is the most studied HMG protein that detects and coordinates cellular stress response. The biological function of HMGB1 depends on its subcellular localization and expression. It plays a critical role in the nucleus and cytoplasm as DNA chaperone, chromosome gatekeeper, autophagy maintainer, and protector from apoptotic cell death. HMGB1 also functions as an extracellular alarmin acting as a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule (DAMP). Recent findings describe HMGB1 as a sophisticated signal of danger, with a pleiotropic function, which is useful as a clinical biomarker for several disorders. HMGB1 has emerged as a mediator in acute and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, HMGB1 targeting can induce beneficial effects on oxidative stress related diseases. This review focus on HMGB1 redox status, localization, mechanisms of release, binding with receptors, and its activities in different oxidative stress-related chronic diseases. Since a growing number of reports show the key role of HMGB1 in socially relevant pathological conditions, to our knowledge, for the first time, here we analyze the scientific literature, evaluating the number of publications focusing on HMGB1 in humans and animal models, per year, from 2006 to 2021 and the number of records published, yearly, per disease and category (studies on humans and animal models).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interferon-γ promotes monocyte-mediated lung injury during influenza infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35235782/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are primary contributors to pathologic IFN-γ response during IAV infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-γ regulates the pathologic phenotype of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes during IAV infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-γ deficiency mitigates IAV-mediated lung injury and improves barrier integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-γ is dispensable to IAV clearance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infection triggers an exuberant host response that promotes acute lung injury. However, the host response factors that promote the development of a pathologic inflammatory response to IAV remain incompletely understood. In this study, we identify an interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-regulated subset of monocytes, CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes, as a driver of lung damage during IAV infection. IFN-γ regulates the recruitment and inflammatory phenotype of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes, and mice deficient in CCR2 (CCR2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) or IFN-γ (IFN-γ&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) exhibit reduced lung inflammation, pathology, and disease severity. Adoptive transfer of wild-type (WT) (IFN-γR1&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;) but not IFN-γR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes restore the WT-like pathological phenotype of lung damage in IAV-infected CCR2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are the main source of IFN-γ in IAV-infected lungs. Collectively, our data highlight the requirement of IFN-γ signaling in the regulation of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocyte-mediated lung pathology during IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a public health emergency of international concerns. Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is a critical clinical symptom of severe COVID-19 patients, and the macrophage is recognized as the direct host cell of SARS-CoV-2 and potential drivers of CSS. In the present study, peramivir was identified to reduce TNF-α by partly intervention of NF-κB activity in LPS-induced macrophage model. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, peramivir reduced the multi-cytokines in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), alleviated the acute lung injury and prolonged the survival time in mice. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs), peramivir could also inhibit the release of TNF-α. Collectively, we proposed that peramivir might be a candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 and other infections related CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An mTOR siRNA-Loaded Spermidine/DNA Tetrahedron Nanoplatform with a Synergistic Anti-Inflammatory Effect on Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35167728/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by severe inflammation and damage to the lung air-blood barrier, resulting in respiratory function damage and life-threatening outcomes. Macrophage polarization plays an essential role in the occurrence, development, and outcome of ALI. As drug carriers, self-assembled DNA nanostructures can potentially overcome the drawbacks and limitations of traditional anti-inflammatory agents owing to their nontoxicity, programmability, and excellent structural control at the nanoscale. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) and drug dual therapy nanoplatform are proposed and constructed here to combat ALI. The nanoplatform consists of a spermidine-assembled DNA tetrahedron and four mammalian target of rapamycin siRNAs. Spermidine serves as a mediator of drug delivery vehicle synthesis and a drug that alters macrophage polarization. Both spermidine and siRNA exert anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo by regulating the macrophage phenotype. More importantly, these factors exhibit a synergistic anti-inflammatory effect by promoting macrophage autophagy. For the first time, an anti-inflammatory dual therapy strategy that uses self-assembled DNA nanostructures as nontoxic, programmable delivery vehicles is proposed and demonstrated through this work. Future work on utilizing DNA nanostructures for the treatment of noncancerous diseases such as ALI is highly promising and desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salt-inducible kinases inhibitor HG-9-91-01 targets RIPK3 kinase activity to alleviate necroptosis-mediated inflammatory injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35217652/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) functions as a central regulator of necroptosis, mediating signaling transduction to activate pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) phosphorylation. Increasing evidences show that RIPK3 contributes to the pathologies of inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis, infection and colitis. Here, we identified a novel small molecular compound Salt-inducible Kinases (SIKs) inhibitor HG-9-91-01 inhibiting necroptosis by targeting RIPK3 kinase activity. We found that SIKs inhibitor HG-9-91-01 could block TNF- or Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-mediated necroptosis independent of SIKs. We revealed that HG-9-91-01 dramatically decreased cellular activation of RIPK3 and MLKL. Meanwhile, HG-9-91-01 inhibited the association of RIPK3 with MLKL and oligomerization of downstream MLKL. Interestingly, we found that HG-9-91-01 also trigger RIPK3-RIPK1-caspase 1-caspase 8-dependent apoptosis, which activated cleavage of GSDME leading to its dependent pyroptosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that SIKs inhibitor HG-9-91-01 directly inhibited RIPK3 kinase activity to block necroptosis and interacted with RIPK3 and recruited RIPK1 to activate caspases leading to cleave GSDME. Importantly, mice pretreated with HG-9-91-01 showed resistance to TNF-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Consistently, HG-9-91-01 treatment protected mice against Staphylococcus aureus-mediated lung damage through targeting RIPK3 kinase activity. Overall, our results revealed that SIKs inhibitor HG-9-91-01 is a novel inhibitor of RIPK3 kinase and a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of necroptosis-mediated inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The long noncoding RNA MIR122HG is a precursor for miR-122-5p and negatively regulates the TAK1-induced innate immune response in teleost fish</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a diverse subset of RNA species of noncoding transcripts that are usually longer than 200 nt. However, the biological role and function of many lncRNAs have not been fully identified. It has been shown that one potential function of lncRNAs is to act as a precursor miRNA and promote the production of multiple miRNAs. However, the function of the miiuy croaker lncRNA MIR122HG has not been explored. In the present study, we show that this differentially expressed teleost fish lncRNA can act as the host gene of miR-122-5p, regulate its expression, and indirectly regulate the expression of potential inflammatory target protein transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1. We show that MIR122HG can negatively regulate the transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1-triggered NF-κB and interferon regulatory factor 3 signaling pathways and subsequently attenuate the innate immune response. In addition, MIR122HG can promote the replication of Siniperca chuatsi rhabdovirus and exacerbate the pathological effects caused by viral infection. We conclude that the study of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction through bioinformatics analysis or experimental-supported analysis can provide information for further elucidation of the functions of fish lncRNAs in innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tunicamycin Protects against LPS-Induced Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pulmonary endothelium is a dynamic semipermeable barrier that orchestrates tissue-fluid homeostasis; regulating physiological and immunological responses. Endothelial abnormalities are caused by inflammatory stimuli interacting with intracellular messengers to remodel cytoskeletal junctions and adhesion proteins. Those phenomena are associated with sepsis, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The molecular processes beyond those responses are the main interest of our group. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a highly conserved molecular pathway resolving protein-folding defects to counteract cellular threats. An emerging body of evidence suggests that UPR is a promising target against lung and cardiovascular disease. In the present study, we reveal that Tunicamycin (TM) (UPR inducer) protects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury. The barrier function of the inflamed endothelium was evaluated in vitro (transendothelial and paracellular permeability); as well as in mice exposed to TM after LPS. Our study demonstrates that TM supports vascular barrier function by modulating actomyosin remodeling. Moreover, it reduces the internalization of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), enhancing endothelial integrity. We suggest that UPR activation may deliver novel therapeutic opportunities in diseases related to endothelial dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phosphoinositide 3 Kinase γ Plays a Critical Role in Acute Kidney Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory cells contribute to the pathogenesis of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). However, the signaling mechanisms underlying the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the kidney are not well understood. In this study, we examined the effects of phosphoinositide 3 kinase γ (PI3Kγ) on inflammatory cells infiltration into the kidney in response to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Compared with wild-type mice, PI3Kγ knockout mice displayed less IRI in the kidney with fewer tubular apoptotic cell. Furthermore, PI3Kγ deficiency decreased the number of infiltrated neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells in the kidney, which was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the kidney. Moreover, wild-type mice treated with AS-605240, a selective PI3Kγ inhibitor, displayed less tubular damage, accumulated fewer inflammatory cells, and expressed less proinflammatory molecules in the kidney following IRI. These results demonstrate that PI3Kγ has a critical role in the pathogenesis of kidney damage in IRI, indicating that PI3Kγ inhibition may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of ischemia-reperfusion-induced kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein-4 promotes renal inflammatory injury in type 2 diabetes mellitus</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35218794/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35218794/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein-4 (RasGRP4) is an activator of Ras protein, which plays significant roles in both the inflammatory response and immune activation. This study determined the role of RasGRP4 in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to establish RasGRP4 knockout (KO) mice. Diabetes was induced by a high-fat diet combined with five consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) in C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice and RasGRP4 KO mice. Hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson&amp;rsquo;s trichrome staining were used to observe the histology of pathological injury. Immunohistochemical staining was used to analyze inflammatory cell infiltration. Quantitative PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of inflammatory mediators and the activation of signaling pathways in renal tissues. In vitro cell co-culture experiments were performed to explore the interactions between peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; RasGRP4 KO mice developed less severe diabetic kidney injury compared to WT mice, exhibiting lower proteinuria, reduced CD3+ T lymphocyte and F4/80+ macrophage infiltration, less inflammatory mediator expression including interleukin 6, tumor necrosis alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and lower expression levels of critical signal transduction molecules in the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 inflammasome and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways in the diabetic kidney. In vitro experiments showed that the adhesion function of PBMCs of RasGRP4 KO mice was reduced compared to that of WT mice. Moreover, the expression of adhesion molecules and critical signal transduction molecules in the NLRP3 inflammasome and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways in GEnCs was stimulated by the supernatant of PBMCs, which were derived from RasGRP4 KO mice treated with high glucose and were also significantly reduced compared to those derived from WT mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; RasGRP4 promotes the inflammatory injury mediated by PBMCs in diabetes, probably by regulating the interaction between PBMCs and GEnCs and further activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interferons (IFNs) are critical soluble factors in the immune system and are composed of three types, (I, II and III) that utilize different receptor complexes IFN-αR1/IFN-αR2, IFN-γR1/IFN-γR2, and IFN-λR1/IL-10R2, respectively. Here we identify IFN-υ from the genomic sequences of vertebrates. The members of class II cytokine receptors, IFN-υR1 and IL-10R2, are identified as the receptor complex of IFN-υ, and are associated with IFN-υ stimulated gene expression and antiviral activity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis). IFN-υ and IFN-υR1 are separately located at unique and highly conserved loci, being distinct from all other three-type IFNs. IFN-υ and IFN-υR1 are phylogenetically clustered with class II cytokines and class II cytokine receptors, respectively. Therefore, the finding of this IFN ligand-receptor system may be considered as a type IV IFN, in addition to the currently recognized three types of IFNs in vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prompt Antiviral Action of Pulmonary CD8&#43; TRM Cells Is Mediated by Rapid IFN-γ Induction and Its Downstream ISGs in the Lung</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35296070/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing lines of evidence supported the importance of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; lung tissue resident memory T (T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;) cells in protection against respiratory viruses, exemplified by influenza A virus. However, the underlying &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; mechanism remains largely undetermined. Here, we used mouse infection models to dissect &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; cross-protective activity of lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells. By simultaneously interrogating transcriptional dynamics in lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells and surrounding tissues during the early course of infection, we demonstrated that lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells react to antigen re-exposure within hours, manifested by IFN-γ upregulation, and a tissue-wide interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) program is subsequently elicited. Using antibody-mediated IFN-γ neutralization and IFN-γ receptor knockout mice, we could show that the induction of several important antiviral ISGs required IFN-γ signaling, so did the suppression of key inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, there were also examples of ISGs unaffected in the absence of IFN-γ activity. Collectively, focusing on &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; characterization of lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells during very early stage of infection, a critical period of host antiviral defense that has been poorly investigated, our studies highlight that these cells, once triggered by antigen re-exposure, are programmed to produce IFN-γ expeditiously to promote a lung-wide antiviral response for effective virus control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sepsis promotes splenic production of a protective platelet pool with high CD40 ligand expression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35192546/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platelets have a wide range of functions including critical roles in hemostasis, thrombosis, and immunity. We hypothesized that during acute inflammation, such as in life-threatening sepsis, there are fundamental changes in the sites of platelet production and phenotypes of resultant platelets. Here, we showed during sepsis that the spleen was a major site of megakaryopoiesis and platelet production. Sepsis provoked an adrenergic-dependent mobilization of megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) from the bone marrow to the spleen, where IL-3 induced their differentiation into megakaryocytes (MKs). In the spleen, immune-skewed MKs produced a CD40 ligandhi platelet population with potent immunomodulatory functions. Transfusions of post-sepsis platelets enriched from splenic production enhanced immune responses and reduced overall mortality in sepsis-challenged animals. These findings identify a spleen-derived protective platelet population that may be broadly immunomodulatory in acute inflammatory states such as sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BCG vaccination provides protection against IAV but not SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35235831/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BCG vaccination provides significant protection against IAV in mice and hamsters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BCG provides no protection against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and hamsters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 induces pulmonary hemorrhage and disseminates to the bone marrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monocytes from BCG-vaccinated humans induce more cytokines to IAV than SARS-CoV-2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the vast majority of species solely rely on innate immunity for host defense, it stands to reason that a critical evolutionary trait like immunological memory evolved in this primitive branch of our immune system. There is ample evidence that vaccines such as bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induce protective innate immune memory responses (trained immunity) against heterologous pathogens. Here we show that while BCG vaccination significantly reduces morbidity and mortality against influenza A virus (IAV), it fails to provide protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In contrast to IAV, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to unique pulmonary vasculature damage facilitating viral dissemination to other organs, including the bone marrow (BM), a central site for BCG-mediated trained immunity. Finally, monocytes from BCG-vaccinated individuals mount an efficient cytokine response to IAV infection, while this response is minimal following SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our data suggest that the protective capacity of BCG vaccination is contingent on viral pathogenesis and tissue tropism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Buformin alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis through an AMPK-dependent pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35132999/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated macrophage pyroptosis plays an important role in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Inhibition of pyroptosis may be a way to alleviate inflammation as well as tissue damage triggered after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The aim of the present study was to explore whether buformin (BF), a hypoglycemic agent, could alleviate sepsis-induced ALI by inhibiting pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Wildtype C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into control group, BF group, LPS group and LPS+BF group. BF group and LPS+BF group were pretreated with BF at a dose of 25 mg/kg, and the changes were observed. In addition, BF was used to interfere with THP-1 cells. The therapeutic effect of BF has been verified by intraperitoneal injection of BF in vivo after LPS stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation and injury was significantly reduced in BF pretreated mice, and the indexes related to pyroptosis were suppressed. The phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in lung tissues of mice in the BF and LPS+BF groups was significantly higher. In THP-1 cells, the AMPK inhibitor, Compound C was added to demonstrate that BF worked via AMPK to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome. It was further demonstrated that BF up-regulated autophagy, which in turn promoted NLRP3 inflammasome degradation. On the other hand, BF decreased NLRP3 mRNA level by increasing nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). And BF showed a therapeutic effect after LPS challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study confirmed that BF inhibited NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in sepsis-induced ALI by up-regulating autophagy and Nrf2 protein level through an AMPK-dependent pathway. This provides a new strategy for clinical mitigation of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insights into peptidylarginine deiminase expression and citrullination pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35197210/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are calcium-dependent enzymes that mediate citrullination, an irreversible post-translational modification (PTM). PAD enzymes have received increasing attention in (patho-)physiology since multi-omics analysis accelerated their expression profiling. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of PAD expression at the RNA and protein levels, and a list of annotated substrates per PAD isozyme. We discuss novel roles of citrullination in cellular growth, epigenetic regulation, tissue remodeling, inflammation, and cancer in mouse models and humans. Additionally, we cluster similar effects of protein deimination to offer a different perspective and improve our understanding of citrullination in health and disease. Citrullination should no longer be considered as a rare PTM, but as an important regulatory mechanism in physiology and pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CRISPR/Cas9-Engineered HLA-Deleted Glomerular Endothelial Cells as a Tool to Predict Pathogenic Non-HLA Antibodies in Kidney Transplant Recipients</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35167486/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; After kidney transplantation, donor-specific antibodies against human leukocyte antigen donor-specific antibodies (HLA-DSAs) drive antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) and are associated with poor transplant outcomes. However, ABMR histology (ABMRh) is increasingly reported in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) without HLA-DSAs, highlighting the emerging role of non-HLA antibodies (Abs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We designed a non-HLA Ab detection immunoassay (NHADIA) using HLA class I and II-deficient glomerular endothelial cells (CiGEnCΔHLA) that had been previously generated through CRISPR/Cas9-induced &lt;em&gt;B2M&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CIITA&lt;/em&gt; gene disruption. Flow cytometry assessed the reactivity to non-HLA antigens of pretransplantation serum samples from 389 consecutive KTRs. The intensity of the signal observed with the NHADIA was associated with post-transplant graft histology assessed in 951 adequate biopsy specimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We sequentially applied CRISPR/Cas9 to delete the &lt;em&gt;B2M&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CIITA&lt;/em&gt; genes to obtain a CiGEnCΔHLA clone. CiGEnCΔHLA cells remained indistinguishable from the parental cell line, CiGEnC, in terms of morphology and phenotype. Previous transplantation was the main determinant of the pretransplantation NHADIA result (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Stratification of 3-month allograft biopsy specimens (n=298) according to pretransplantation NHADIA tertiles demonstrated that higher levels of non-HLA Abs positively correlated with increased glomerulitis (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.002), microvascular inflammation (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.003), and ABMRh (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.03). A pretransplantation NHADIA threshold of 1.87 strongly discriminated the KTRs with the highest risk of ABMRh (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.005, log-rank test). A multivariate Cox model confirmed that NHADIA status and HLA-DSAs were independent, yet synergistic, predictors of ABMRh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The NHADIA identifies non-HLA Abs and strongly predicts graft endothelial injury independent of HLA-DSAs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate whether hUC-MSCs attenuated severe burn-induced ALI and the effects were based on TSG-6 secreted from hUC-MSCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Method:&lt;/em&gt; A rat model was established and evaluated as follows: cytokine expression was measured by ELISA, and both inflammatory cell infiltration and lung injury were assessed by immunohistochemistry assay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, TSG-6 levels in serum from the burn group were significantly increased compared with those from the sham group. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, TSG-6 levels of lung tissues and serum in the burn+hUC-MSC group were significantly increased compared with those in the burn group. Both in lung tissues and in serum, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) were remarkably decreased, but the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased after hUC-MSC administration (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). These significant positive effects after hUC-MSC transplantation did not occur in the burn+siTSG-6 group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The intratracheal implantation of hUC-MSCs has been an effective treatment for severe burn-induced ALI via promoting TSG-6 secretion and inhibiting inflammatory reaction in lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-17 Receptor C Signaling Controls CD4&#43; TH17 Immune Responses and Tissue Injury in Immune-Mediated Kidney Diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35167487/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; IL-17A-producing CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T helper (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17) cells play a critical role in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, such as crescentic GN. The proinflammatory effects of IL-17 are mediated by the activation of the IL-17RA/IL-17RC complex. Although the expression of these receptors on epithelial and endothelial cells is well characterized, the IL-17 receptor expression pattern and function on hematopoietic cells, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell subsets, remains to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Crescentic GN (nephrotoxic nephritis) was induced in IL-17A, IFNγ, and Foxp3 triple-reporter mice for sorting of renal CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell subsets and subsequent single-cell RNA sequencing. Moreover, we generated T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cell-specific IL-17RA and IL-17RC gene-deficient mice and studied the functional role of IL-17 signaling in T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells in crescentic GN, imiquimod-induced psoriasis, and in the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45RB&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; T cell transfer colitis model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We identified a specific expression of the IL-17 receptor A/C complex on CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing of T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells revealed the activation of the IL-17 receptor signaling pathway in experimental crescentic GN. Disruption of the IL-17RC signaling pathway in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and, most importantly, specifically in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells, potentiates the IL-17 cytokine response and results in an accelerated course of experimental crescentic GN. Comparable results were observed in experimental models of psoriasis and colitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings indicate that IL-17 receptor C signaling has a previously unrecognized function in the regulation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells and in the control of organ-specific autoimmunity and might provide new insights into the development of more efficient anti-T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poxviruses and paramyxoviruses use a conserved mechanism of STAT1 antagonism to inhibit interferon signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35182467/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poxvirus protein 018 is a virulence factor that inhibits IFN-induced signaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;018 binds the STAT1 SH2 domain to block its recruitment to the IFNγ receptor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The structure of the 018:STAT1 complex reveals a pTyr-independent binding mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccinia and Nipah viruses acquired a STAT1-binding motif by convergent evolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The induction of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes by STATs is a critical host defense mechanism against virus infection. Here, we report that a highly expressed poxvirus protein, 018, inhibits IFN-induced signaling by binding to the SH2 domain of STAT1, thereby preventing the association of STAT1 with an activated IFN receptor. Despite encoding other inhibitors of IFN-induced signaling, a poxvirus mutant lacking 018 was attenuated in mice. The 2.0 Å crystal structure of the 018:STAT1 complex reveals a phosphotyrosine-independent mode of 018 binding to the SH2 domain of STAT1. Moreover, the STAT1-binding motif of 018 shows similarity to the STAT1-binding proteins from Nipah virus, which, similar to 018, block the association of STAT1 with an IFN receptor. Overall, these results uncover a conserved mechanism of STAT1 antagonism that is employed independently by distinct virus families.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quercetin-3-Rutinoside alleviates radiation-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis via regulation of NF-κB/TGF-β1 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35219007/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation exposure to lungs during nuclear catastrophes or radiotherapy poses long-term side effects and can induce pulmonary injury sufficient for causing death. The strategies for preventing or reversing radiation-induced lung injuries have not been yet developed. Quercetin-3-Rutinoside (Q-3-R), a polyphenolic bioflavonoid, has shown multifaceted pharmacological applications due to its high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; In the current study, the potential of Q-3-R against radiation-induced lung pneumonitis/fibrosis and the possible underlying mechanism was investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study design: To evaluate the effect of Q-3-R against lung damage, C57Bl/6 mice were administered with Q-3-R (10 mg/kg b.wt.) and irradiated with a single dose of gamma radiation (12 Gy) at thoracic region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; 16 weeks after irradiation lung damage was seen by histopathological studies and staining for collagen deposition. Expression of Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Smad3, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), α-smooth muscle actin protein (α-SMA), Aquaporin 5 (AQP 5), Interleukins (IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and caspase-3 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry/western blot/Elisa. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)/ Nitric oxide (NO) scavenging potential of Q-3-R and inhibition of cell death in irradiated lungs were also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Mice showed signs of pneumonitis and fibrotic changes in lungs following radiation treatment. A dramatic increase in inflammatory cells and cytokines contributing to lung disease pathogenesis was observed. Furthermore, expression of NF-κB, TGF-β1, Smad3, ICAM-1, AQP5and α-SMA was found markedly up-regulated. However, pretreatment of Q-3-R significantly attenuated radiation-induced pneumonitis and fibrosis. Histological examination revealed less structural and fibrotic changes with down-regulation of AQP 5, ICAM-1, α-SMA and caspase-3 in Q-3-R pretreated irradiated groups. The formulation significantly relieved lung injury by suppressing inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines such as IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β1 via inhibition of NF-κB. Q-3-R also curtailed radiation-induced ROS/NO generation and minimized DNA damage in the irradiated lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The findings from the current study clearly demonstrate that Q-3-R provides radioprotection to the lungs by regulating NF-κB/TGF-β1 signaling, scavenging free radicals, preventing perivascular infiltration and prolonged inflammatory cascade which could otherwise lead to chronic radiation fibrosis. Q-3-R can be proved as a potential therapeutic agent for alleviating radiation-induced lung injury in case of planned or unplanned radiation exposure scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Korean Red Ginseng, a regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome, in the COVID-19 pandemic</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits various symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia or death. The major features of patients in severe COVID-19 are the dysregulation of cytokine secretion, pneumonia, and acute lung injury. Consequently, it leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multiple organ failure, and death. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of COVID-19, influences nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), the sensor of inflammasomes, directly or indirectly, culminating in the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome and activation of inflammatory caspases, which induce the inflammatory disruption in severe COVID-19. Accordingly, the target therapeutics for inflammasome has attracted attention as a treatment for COVID-19. Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) inhibits several inflammatory responses, including the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. This review discusses the role of KRG in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 based on its anti-NLRP3 inflammasome efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in fine particulate matter-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35182631/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution poses significant health concerns worldwide and can cause respiratory diseases. However, how it causes health problems is still poorly understood. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 is a terminal carboxypeptidase implicated in the functions of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and plays a crucial role in the control of lung inflammation. To investigate whether ACE2 functions in PM2.5-induced lung inflammation, wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice and ACE2 knock-out (KO) mice were intratracheally instilled with PBS or PM2.5 suspension for 3 consecutive days, respectively. The concentrations of cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined by ELISA. The expression of ACE2 and ACE and activation of inflammatory signaling pathways in lung tissues were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting. We found that PM2.5 exposure increased ACE2 expression. Loss of ACE2 significantly elevated the levels of total proteins, total cells, and the concentrations of MCP-1, IL-1β in BALF after PM2.5 challenge. Additionally, loss of ACE2 enhanced lung pathologies, airway resistance, and inflammatory signaling activation. Collectively, loss of ACE2 exacerbates PM2.5-induced acute lung injury in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A cortactin CTTN coding SNP contributes to lung vascular permeability and inflammatory disease severity in African descent subjects</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35181549/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cortactin gene (CTTN), encoding an actin-binding protein critically involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity, contains single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with severe asthma in Black patients. As loss of lung EC integrity is a major driver of mortality in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and the acute chest syndrome (ACS), we speculated CTTN SNPs that alter EC barrier function will associate with clinical outcomes from these types of conditions in Black patients. In case-control studies, evaluation of a nonsynonymous CTTN coding SNP Ser484Asn (rs56162978, G/A) in a severe sepsis cohort (725 Black subjects) revealed significant association with increased risk of sepsis mortality. In a separate cohort of sickle cell disease (SCD) subjects with and without ACS (177 SCD Black subjects), significantly increased risk of ACS and increased ACS severity (need for mechanical ventilation) was observed in carriers of the A allele. Human lung EC expressing the cortactin S484N transgene exhibited: (i) delayed EC barrier recovery following thrombin-induced permeability; (ii) reduced levels of critical Tyr486 cortactin phosphorylation; (iii) inhibited binding to the cytoskeletal regulator, nmMLCK; and (iv) attenuated EC barrier-promoting lamellipodia dynamics and biophysical responses. ARDS-challenged Cttn+/- heterozygous mice exhibited increased lung vascular permeability (compared to wild-type mice) which was significantly attenuated by IV delivery of liposomes encargoed with CTTN WT transgene but not by CTTN S484N transgene. In summary, these studies suggest that the CTTN S484N coding SNP contributes to severity of inflammatory injury in Black patients, potentially via delayed vascular barrier restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Balanced T and B cell responses are required for immune protection against Powassan virus in virus-like particle vaccination</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-borne pathogen for which humans are an incidental host. POWV infection can be fatal or result in long-term neurological sequelae; however, there are no approved vaccinations for POWV. Integral to efficacious vaccine development is the identification of correlates of protection, which we accomplished in this study by utilizing a murine model of POWV infection. Using POWV lethal and sub-lethal challenge models, we show that (1) robust B and T cell responses are necessary for immune protection, (2) POWV lethality can be attributed to both viral- and host-mediated drivers of disease, and (3) knowledge of the immune correlates of protection against POWV can be applied in a virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccination approach that provides protection from lethal POWV challenge. Identification of these immune protection factors is significant as it will aid in the rational design of POWV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular hydrogen exerts biological effects on nearly all organs. It has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging effects and contributes to the regulation of autophagy and cell death. As the primary organ for gas exchange, the lungs are constantly exposed to various harmful environmental irritants. Short- or long-term exposure to these harmful substances often results in lung injury, causing respiratory and lung diseases. Acute and chronic respiratory diseases have high rates of morbidity and mortality and have become a major public health concern worldwide. For example, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic. An increasing number of studies have revealed that hydrogen may protect the lungs from diverse diseases, including acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung cancer, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we highlight the multiple functions of hydrogen and the mechanisms underlying its protective effects in various lung diseases, with a focus on its roles in disease pathogenesis and clinical significance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TBK1 directly phosphorylates METTL3 at serine 67 upon VSV infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TBK1 promotes catalytic activity of METTL3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S67 phosphorylation enhances METTL3 function in promoting translation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mRNA m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification is heavily involved in modulation of immune responses. However, its function in antiviral immunity is controversial, and how immune responses regulate m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification remains elusive. We here find TBK1, a key kinase of antiviral pathways, phosphorylates the core m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methyltransferase METTL3 at serine 67. The phosphorylated METTL3 interacts with the translational complex, which is required for enhancing protein translation, thus facilitating antiviral responses. TBK1 also promotes METTL3 activation and m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification to stabilize IRF3 mRNA. Type I interferon (IFN) induction is severely impaired in METTL3-deficient cells. &lt;em&gt;Mettl3&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;-lyz2-Cre mice are more susceptible to influenza A virus (IAV)-induced lethality than control mice. Consistently, &lt;em&gt;Ythdf1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice show higher mortality than wild-type mice due to decreased IRF3 expression and subsequently attenuated IFN production. Together, we demonstrate that innate signals activate METTL3 via TBK1, and METTL3-mediated m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification secures antiviral immunity by promoting mRNA stability and protein translation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Viral PB1-F2 and host IFN-γ guide ILC2 and T cell activity during influenza virus infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation of functional immune cell plasticity is poorly understood. Host environmental cues are critical, but the possible influence of pathogen-derived virulence factors has not been described. We have used reverse-engineered influenza A viruses that differ in PB1-F2 activity to analyze influenza in mice in the presence or absence of host interferon (IFN)-γ. In the absence of functional PB1-F2 and IFN-γ, lung ILC2s initiated robust IL-5 responses following viral challenge, which led to improved tissue integrity and survival. Conversely, functional PB1-F2 suppressed IL-5&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ILC2 responses and induced a dominant IL-13&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8 T cell response regardless of host IFN-γ. These findings demonstrate the critical interplay between the viral virulence factors and host cytokines in regulating protective pulmonary immunity during influenza virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional plasticity of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and T cells is regulated by host environmental cues, but the influence of pathogen-derived virulence factors has not been described. We now report the interplay between host interferon (IFN)-γ and viral PB1-F2 virulence protein in regulating the functions of ILC2s and T cells that lead to recovery from influenza virus infection of mice. In the absence of IFN-γ, lung ILC2s from mice challenged with the A/California/04/2009 (CA04) H1N1 virus, containing nonfunctional viral PB1-F2, initiated a robust IL-5 response, which also led to improved tissue integrity and increased survival. Conversely, challenge with Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) H1N1 virus expressing fully functional PB1-F2, suppressed IL-5&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ILC2 responses, and induced a dominant IL-13&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8 T cell response, regardless of host IFN-γ expression. IFN-γ–deficient mice had increased survival and improved tissue integrity following challenge with lethal doses of CA04, but not PR8 virus, and increased resistance was dependent on the presence of IFN-γR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ILC2s. Reverse-engineered influenza viruses differing in functional PB1-F2 activity induced ILC2 and T cell phenotypes similar to the PB1-F2 donor strains, demonstrating the potent role of viral PB1-F2 in host resistance. These results show the ability of a pathogen virulence factor together with host IFN-γ to regulate protective pulmonary immunity during influenza infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A therapeutic nanoplatform with ROS-responsiveness was developed for the regulation of inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NPs composed of low Mw of PPADT and high Mw of PTKU were loaded with dexamethasone to obtain a self-adaptive system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dex-loaded NPs significantly decreased lung inflammation, and reduced lung injury and mortality &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with excessive inflammatory response, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) without timely treatment. A fewer effective drugs are available currently to treat the ALI/ARDS. Herein, a therapeutic nanoplatform with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsiveness was developed for the regulation of inflammation. Dexamethasone acetate (Dex) was encapsulated into poly(thioketal) polymers to form polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) (PTKNPs@Dex). The NPs were composed of poly(1,4-phenyleneacetonedimethylene thioketal) (PPADT) and polythioketal urethane (PTKU), in which the thioketal bonds could be cleaved by the high level of ROS at the ALI site. The PTKNPs@Dex could accumulate in the pulmonary inflammatory sites and release the encapsulated payloads rapidly, leading to the decreased ROS level, less generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduced lung injury and mortality of mice. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that the therapeutic efficacy of the NPs was associated with the modulation of many immune and inflammation-linked pathways. These findings provide a newly developed nanoplatform for the efficient treatment of ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An adjuvant strategy enabled by modulation of the physical properties of microbial ligands expands antigen immunogenicity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size and solubility of microbial ligands determine the immune response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fungal mannans are directly drained to the LN to drive cell accrual via interferon release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuning mannan physical properties broadens epitope specificity of SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike antibodies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An adjuvant formulation of mannan/alum induces heterosubtypic immunity against IAV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activation of the innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is key to generate lasting adaptive immunity. PRRs detect unique chemical patterns associated with invading microorganisms, but whether and how the physical properties of PRR ligands influence the development of the immune response remains unknown. Through the study of fungal mannans, we show that the physical form of PRR ligands dictates the immune response. Soluble mannans are immunosilent in the periphery but elicit a potent pro-inflammatory response in the draining lymph node (dLN). By modulating the physical form of mannans, we developed a formulation that targets both the periphery and the dLN. When combined with viral glycoprotein antigens, this mannan formulation broadens epitope recognition, elicits potent antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies, and confers protection against viral infections of the lung. Thus, the physical properties of microbial ligands determine the outcome of the immune response and can be harnessed for vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blocking the human common beta subunit of the GM-CSF, IL-5 and IL-3 receptors markedly reduces hyperinflammation in ARDS models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35145069/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is triggered by various aetiological factors such as trauma, sepsis and respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Immune profiling of severe COVID-19 patients has identified a complex pattern of cytokines including granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-5, which are significant mediators of viral-induced hyperinflammation. This strong response has prompted the development of therapies that block GM-CSF and other cytokines individually to limit inflammation related pathology. The common cytokine binding site of the human common beta (β&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor signals for three inflammatory cytokines: GM-CSF, IL-5 and IL-3. In this study, β&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; was targeted with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) CSL311 in engineered mice devoid of mouse β&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and βIL-3 and expressing human β&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; (hβ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;Tg mice). Direct pulmonary administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused ARDS-like lung injury, and CSL311 markedly reduced lung inflammation and oedema, resulting in improved oxygen saturation levels in hβ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;Tg mice. In a separate model, influenza (HKx31) lung infection caused viral pneumonia associated with a large influx of myeloid cells into the lungs of hβ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;Tg mice. The therapeutic application of CSL311 potently decreased accumulation of monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils without altering lung viral loads. Furthermore, CSL311 treatment did not limit the viral-induced expansion of NK and NKT cells, or the tissue expression of type I/II/III interferons needed for efficient viral clearance. Simultaneously blocking GM-CSF, IL-5 and IL-3 signalling with CSL311 may represent an improved and clinically applicable strategy to reducing hyperinflammation in the ARDS setting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long noncoding RNA Gm31629 protects against mucosal damage in experimental colitis via YB-1/E2F pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mucosal healing is a key treatment goal for inflammatory bowel disease, and adequate epithelial regeneration is required for an intact gut epithelium. However, the underlying mechanism for mucosal healing is unclear. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be involved in the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we report that a lncRNA named Gm31629 decreased in intestinal epithelial cells in response to inflammatory stimulation. Gm31629 deficiency led to exacerbated intestinal inflammation and delayed epithelial regeneration in dextran sulfate sodium-induced (DSS-induced) colitis model. Mechanistically, Gm31629 promoted E2F pathways and cell proliferation by stabilizing Y-box protein 1 (YB-1), thus facilitating epithelial regeneration. Genetic overexpression of Gm31629 protected against DSS-induced colitis in vivo. Theaflavin 3-gallate, a natural compound mimicking Gm31629, alleviated DSS-induced epithelial inflammation and mucosal damage. These results demonstrate an essential role of lncRNA Gm31629 in linking intestinal inflammation and epithelial cell proliferation, providing a potential therapeutic approach to inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time we have defined naïve, central memory, effector memory and differentiated effector porcine CD8 T cells and analyzed their distribution in lymphoid and respiratory tissues after influenza infection or immunization, using peptide-MHC tetramers of three influenza nucleoprotein (NP) epitopes. The hierarchy of response to the three epitopes changes during the response in different tissues. Most NP-specific CD8 T cells in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and lung are tissue resident memory cells (TRM) that express CD69 and downregulate CD45RA and CCR7. NP-specific cells isolated from BAL express genes characteristic of TRM, but gene expression differs at 7, 21 and 63 days post infection. In all tissues the frequency of NP-specific CD8 cells declines over 63 days almost to background levels but is best maintained in BAL. The kinetic of influenza specific memory CD8 T cell in this natural host species differs from that in small animal models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization associates with impaired adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BackgroundAlthough recent epidemiological data suggest that pneumococci may contribute to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 disease, cases of coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during hospitalization have been reported infrequently. This apparent contradiction may be explained by interactions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and pneumococci in the upper airway, resulting in the escape of SARS-CoV-2 from protective host immune responses.MethodsHere, we investigated the relationship of these 2 respiratory pathogens in 2 distinct cohorts of health care workers with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection identified by systematic screening and patients with moderate to severe disease who presented to the hospital. We assessed the effect of coinfection on host antibody, cellular, and inflammatory responses to the virus.ResultsIn both cohorts, pneumococcal colonization was associated with diminished antiviral immune responses, which primarily affected mucosal IgA levels among individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection and cellular memory responses in infected patients.ConclusionOur findings suggest that S. pneumoniae impair host immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and raise the question of whether pneumococcal carriage also enables immune escape of other respiratory viruses and facilitates reinfection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ADAM8 signaling drives neutrophil migration and ARDS severity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) results in catastrophic lung failure and has an urgent, unmet need for improved early recognition and therapeutic development. Neutrophil influx is a hallmark of ARDS and is associated with the release of tissue-destructive immune effectors, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and membrane-anchored metalloproteinase disintegrins (ADAMs). Here, we observed using intravital microscopy that Adam8-/- mice had impaired neutrophil transmigration. In mouse pneumonia models, both genetic deletion and pharmacologic inhibition of ADAM8 attenuated neutrophil infiltration and lung injury while improving bacterial containment. Unexpectedly, the alterations of neutrophil function were not attributable to impaired proteolysis but resulted from reduced intracellular interactions of ADAM8 with the actin-based motor molecule Myosin1f that suppressed neutrophil motility. In 2 ARDS cohorts, we analyzed lung fluid proteolytic signatures and identified that ADAM8 activity was positively correlated with disease severity. We propose that in acute inflammatory lung diseases such as pneumonia and ARDS, ADAM8 inhibition might allow fine-tuning of neutrophil responses for therapeutic gain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute lung injury has few treatment options and a high mortality rate. Upon injury, neutrophils infiltrate the lungs and form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), damaging the lungs and driving an exacerbated immune response. Unfortunately, no drug preventing NET formation has completed clinical development. Here, we report that disulfiram - an FDA-approved drug for alcohol use disorder - dramatically reduced NETs, increased survival, improved blood oxygenation, and reduced lung edema in a transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) mouse model. We then tested whether disulfiram could confer protection in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as NETs are elevated in patients with severe COVID-19. In SARS-CoV-2-infected golden hamsters, disulfiram reduced NETs and perivascular fibrosis in the lungs, and it downregulated innate immune and complement/coagulation pathways, suggesting that it could be beneficial for patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, an existing FDA-approved drug can block NET formation and improve disease course in 2 rodent models of lung injury for which treatment options are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation post-traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) induces microglial activation, which leads to prolonged neurological dysfunction. However, the mechanism underlying microglial activation-induced neuroinflammation remains poorly understood. Ruxolitinib (RUX), a selective inhibitor of JAK1/2, was recently reported to inhibit inflammatory storms caused by SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. However, its role in disrupting inflammation post-SCI has not been confirmed. In this study, microglia were treated with RUX for 24 hours and then activated with interferon-γ for 6 hours. The results showed that interferon-γ-induced phosphorylation of JAK and STAT in microglia was inhibited, and the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and cell proliferation marker Ki67 were reduced. In further in vivo experiments, a mouse model of spinal cord injury was treated intragastrically with RUX for 3 successive days, and the findings suggest that RUX can inhibit microglial proliferation by inhibiting the interferon-γ/JAK/STAT pathway. Moreover, microglia treated with RUX centripetally migrated toward injured foci, remaining limited and compacted within the glial scar, which resulted in axon preservation and less demyelination. Moreover, the protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 were reduced. The neuromotor function of SCI mice also recovered. These findings suggest that RUX can inhibit neuroinflammation through inhibiting the interferon-γ/JAK/STAT pathway, thereby reducing secondary injury after SCI and producing neuroprotective effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferons (IFN-I) exhibit various biological effects during viral infections, and they have been successfully used for clinical treatment of viral diseases. Humans express 12 IFNα subtypes, which strongly differ in their antiviral responses against different viruses. Here we analyzed the antiviral activity of all human IFNα subtypes against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to identify the underlying immune signatures and explore their therapeutic potential. Our data provide a systemic pattern of antiviral host effector responses mediated by high antiviral IFN-I, which could help to identify key cellular effectors targeted in novel therapeutic approaches against SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferons (IFN-I) exert pleiotropic biological effects during viral infections, balancing virus control versus immune-mediated pathologies, and have been successfully employed for the treatment of viral diseases. Humans express 12 IFN-alpha (α) subtypes, which activate downstream signaling cascades and result in distinct patterns of immune responses and differential antiviral responses. Inborn errors in IFN-I immunity and the presence of anti-IFN autoantibodies account for very severe courses of COVID-19; therefore, early administration of IFN-I may be protective against life-threatening disease. Here we comprehensively analyzed the antiviral activity of all IFNα subtypes against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to identify the underlying immune signatures and explore their therapeutic potential. Prophylaxis of primary human airway epithelial cells (hAEC) with different IFNα subtypes during SARS-CoV-2 infection uncovered distinct functional classes with high, intermediate, and low antiviral IFNs. In particular, IFNα5 showed superior antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice in vivo. Dose dependency studies further displayed additive effects upon coadministration with the broad antiviral drug remdesivir in cell culture. Transcriptomic analysis of IFN-treated hAEC revealed different transcriptional signatures, uncovering distinct, intersecting, and prototypical genes of individual IFNα subtypes. Global proteomic analyses systematically assessed the abundance of specific antiviral key effector molecules which are involved in IFN-I signaling pathways, negative regulation of viral processes, and immune effector processes for the potent antiviral IFNα5. Taken together, our data provide a systemic, multimodular definition of antiviral host responses mediated by defined IFN-I. This knowledge will support the development of novel therapeutic approaches against SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GSDMD-miR-223-NLRP3 axis involved in B(a)P-induced inflammatory injury of alveolar epithelial cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35144130/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pyroptosis occurred simultaneously when B(a)P-induced inflammatory injury in alveolar epithelial A549 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NLRP3 and miRNA-223 were inhibited when knockout of GSDMD in B(a)P-induced A549 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NLRP3 were increased when inhibiting miR-223 in B(a)P-induced A549 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GSDMD may regulate NLRP3 inflammasome through miR-223 in B(a)P induced inflammatory damage in A549 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P], a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, causes lung inflammatory damage. Pyroptosis，a new inflammation-dependent programmed cell death, happened when pyroptosis-related GSDMD is activated mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome. microRNA-223 (miRNA-223) is involved in inflammatory diseases by regulating NLRP3. However, whether GSDMD regulate NLRP3 inflammasome through miR-223 in B(a)P induced lung inflammatory injury remain unknown. In this study, alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were stimulated with 0, 2, 4, 8 μM B(a)P for 12 h or 24 h. The inflammatory injury and pyroptosis were determined. And the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and the level of miRNA-223 were detected. Then, the change of inflammatory injury and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in B(a)P-induced A549 cells were detected after inhibiting of GSDMD or miR-223 using siRNA-GSDMD (siGSDMD) or miR-223 inhibitor, respectively. Our results indicated that after B(a)P exposure, TNF-α and IL-6 in the supernatant were increased. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) results showed that A549 cells were obviously swollen and the cell membrane ruptured. Hoechest33342/PI staining showed that pyroptosis occurred. NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18, GSDMD, GSDMD-N, pro caspase-1 and cleaved caspase-1 were significantly increased. Additionally, after transfecting with siGSDMD in B(a)P-induced A549 cells, the expression level of miR-223 was significantly increased. But IL-6 and TNF-α in the supernatant, the expression of NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18 and cleaved caspase-1 protein were also decreased. And after inhibiting miR-223 in B(a)P-induced A549 cells, the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in the supernatant, the protein expression of NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18 and cleaved caspase-1 were increased. In conclusion, GSDMD may regulate NLRP3 inflammasome through miR-223, which is involved in B(a)P induced inflammatory damage in A549 cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dihydroartemisinin attenuates pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in rats by suppressing JAK2/STAT3 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35120332/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has induced a worldwide pandemic since early 2020. COVID-19 causes pulmonary inflammation, secondary pulmonary fibrosis (PF); however, there are still no effective treatments for PF. The present study aimed to explore the inhibitory effect of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) on pulmonary inflammation and PF, and its molecular mechanism. Morphological changes and collagen deposition were analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson staining, and the hydroxyproline content. DHA attenuated early alveolar inflammation and later PF in a bleomycin-induced rat PF model, and inhibited the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 3 (CCL3) in model rat serum. Further molecular analysis revealed that both pulmonary inflammation and PF were associated with increased transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2), and signal transducer and activator 3(STAT3) expression in the lung tissues of model rats. DHA reduced the inflammatory response and PF in the lungs by suppressing TGF-β1, JAK2, phosphorylated (p)-JAK2, STAT3, and p-STAT3. Thus, DHA exerts therapeutic effects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and PF by inhibiting JAK2-STAT3 activation. DHA inhibits alveolar inflammation, and attenuates lung injury and fibrosis, possibly representing a therapeutic candidate to treat PF associated with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knockdown of receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) alleviated lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, apoptosis and permeability in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells by regulating C-terminal binding protein 2 (CTBP2)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35113002/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main pathological feature of acute lung injury (ALI) is pulmonary edema caused by increased permeability of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). LPS was has been confirmed to lead to cell damage and barrier dysfunction in PMVECs. Furthermore, receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) was discovered to be increased in LPS-induced human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), but the mechanism of RIP140 on LPS-induced HPMECs has not been investigated. In this study, an acute lung injury model was constructed in LPS-induced HPMECs. After RIP140 was downregulated, inflammation, apoptosis and cell permeability levels were detected by RT-qPCR, TUNEL staining and FITC-Dextran, respectively. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels of related factors. The binding of RIP140 and C-terminal binding protein 2 (CTBP2) was predicted by database and verified by Co-IP. Subsequently, CTBP2 overexpression was transfected into cells and the above experiments were performed again. The results showed that inflammation, apoptosis and permeability levels of LPS-induced HPMECs were remarkably increased compared to the untreated control group. However, these levels were suppressed after RIP140 was silenced compared to the LPS-induced HPMECs group. Notably, the Co-IP study demonstrated that RIP140 and CTBP2 interacted with each other. Moreover, CTBP2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of RIP140 silencing on LPS-induced inflammation, apoptosis and permeability levels in HPMECs. Together, the study found that interference of RIP140 could alleviate LPS-induced inflammation, apoptosis and permeability in HPMECs by regulating CTBP2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanocurcumin Potently Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Induced Cytokine Storm by Deactivation of MAPK/NF-κB Signaling in Epithelial Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35112841/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interleukin-mediated deep cytokine storm, an aggressive inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in COVID-19 patients, is correlated directly with lung injury, multi-organ failure, and poor prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients. Curcumin (CUR), a phenolic antioxidant compound obtained from turmeric (&lt;em&gt;Curcuma longa L.&lt;/em&gt;), is well-known for its strong anti-inflammatory activity. However, its &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; efficacy is constrained due to poor bioavailability. Herein, we report that CUR-encapsulated polysaccharide nanoparticles (CUR-PS-NPs) potently inhibit the release of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors associated with damage of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (CoV2-SP)-stimulated liver Huh7.5 and lung A549 epithelial cells. Treatment with CUR-PS-NPs effectively attenuated the interaction of ACE2 and CoV2-SP. The effects of CUR-PS-NPs were linked to reduced NF-κB/MAPK signaling which in turn decreased CoV2-SP-mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK, and p65/NF-κB as well as nuclear p65/NF-κB expression. The findings of the study strongly indicate that organic NPs of CUR can be used to control hyper-inflammatory responses and prevent lung and liver injuries associated with CoV2-SP-mediated cytokine storm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of Nutrient-sensing Receptor GPRC6A in Regulating Colonic Group 3 Innate Lymphoid Cells and Inflamed Mucosal Healing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35134872/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Group 3 innate lymphoid cells [ILC3s] sense environmental signals and are critical in gut homeostasis and immune defence. G-protein-coupled receptors [GPCRs] mediate cellular responses to diverse environmental signals. However, the GPCRs&amp;rsquo; regulation mechanisms of ILC3s is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used wild-type [WT] and &lt;em&gt;GPRC6A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice to investigate the role of GPRC6A in the population and the function of ILC3s. We then purified ILC3s from WT and &lt;em&gt;GPRC6A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Colitis was induced in WT mice and &lt;em&gt;GPRC6A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice through dextran sodium sulphate [DSS] administration or &lt;em&gt;C. rodentium&lt;/em&gt; infection. Furthermore L-arginine, a selective GPRC6A agonist, was administered to mice with colitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that colonic ILC3s expressed GPRC6A. The deficiency of GPRC6A decreased ILC3-derived interleukin-22 [IL-22] production and the number of proliferating ILC3s, which led to increased susceptibility to colon injury and pathogen infection and impaired inflamed mucosal healing. Further studies showed that L-arginine, a GPRC6A agonist, promoted colonic ILC3 expansion and function via the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 [mTORC1] signalling &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, L-arginine attenuated DSS-induced colitis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. This was associated with a significant increase in IL-22 secretion by ILC3s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings unveil a role for the nutrient-sensing receptor GPRC6A in colonic ILC3 function and identify a novel ILC3 receptor signalling pathway modulating inflamed mucosal healing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aspirin activates resolution pathways to reprogram T cell and macrophage responses in colitis-associated colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35108049/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is linked with carcinogenesis in many types of cancer including colorectal cancer (CRC). Aspirin is recommended for the prevention of CRC, although the mechanism(s) mediating its immunomodulatory actions remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that aspirin increased concentrations of the immune-regulatory aspirin-triggered specialized proresolving mediators (AT-SPMs), including AT-lipoxin A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and AT-resolvin D1, in colonic tissues during inflammation-associated CRC (I-CRC). Aspirin also down-regulated the expression of the checkpoint protein programmed cell death protein-1 in macrophages and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells from the colonic mucosa. Inhibition of AT-SPM biosynthesis or knockout of the AT-SPM receptor &lt;em&gt;Alx/Fpr2&lt;/em&gt; reversed the immunomodulatory actions of aspirin on macrophages and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and abrogated its protective effects during I-CRC. Furthermore, treatment of mice with AT-SPM recapitulated the immune-directed actions of aspirin during I-CRC. Together, these findings elucidate a central role for AT-SPM in mediating the immune-directed actions of aspirin in regulating I-CRC progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CBASS phage defense and evolution of antiviral nucleotide signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35123147/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling system (CBASS) immunity is a widespread form of antiphage defense in bacteria and archaea. Each CBASS operon encodes a cGAS/DncV-like Nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) enzyme that synthesizes a nucleotide second messenger in response to viral infection. An associated Cap effector protein then binds the nucleotide signal and executes cell death to destroy the host cell and block phage propagation. Here we build upon recent advances to establish rules controlling each step of CBASS activation and antiphage defense. Comparative analysis of CBASS, CRISPR, Pycsar, and cGAS-STING immunity provides insight into the evolution of phage defense and animal innate immunity and highlights new questions emerging in the role of nucleotide second messenger signaling in host-virus interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dipeptidase-1 governs renal inflammation during ischemia reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35108057/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms that drive leukocyte recruitment to the kidney are incompletely understood. Dipeptidase-1 (DPEP1) is a major neutrophil adhesion receptor highly expressed on proximal tubular cells and peritubular capillaries of the kidney. Renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) induces robust neutrophil and monocyte recruitment and causes acute kidney injury (AKI). Renal inflammation and the AKI phenotype were attenuated in &lt;em&gt;Dpep1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice or mice pretreated with DPEP1 antagonists, including the LSALT peptide, a nonenzymatic DPEP1 inhibitor. DPEP1 deficiency or inhibition primarily blocked neutrophil adhesion to peritubular capillaries and reduced inflammatory monocyte recruitment to the kidney after IRI. CD44 but not ICAM-1 blockade also decreased neutrophil recruitment to the kidney during IRI and was additive to DPEP1 effects. DPEP1, CD44, and ICAM-1 all contributed to the recruitment of monocyte/macrophages to the kidney following IRI. These results identify DPEP1 as a major leukocyte adhesion receptor in the kidney and potential therapeutic target for AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KIAA1199 drives immune suppression to promote colorectal cancer liver metastasis by modulating neutrophil infiltration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35108400/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35108400/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer mortality, and colorectal cancer (CRC) frequently metastasizes to the liver. Our previous studies demonstrated the critical role of KIAA1199 in tumor invasion and metastasis in CRC. In the present study, we described an immune regulatory effect of KIAA1199 that creates a permissive environment for metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt; Flow cytometry was used to examine the effects of KIAA1199 on the infiltration of tumor immune cells. Neutrophils and T cells were isolated, stimulated, and/or cultured for in vitro function assays. In the patients with CRC, high expression levels of KIAA1199 were associated with an increased neutrophil infiltration into the liver. This result was further validated in mouse metastasis models. The increased influx of neutrophils contributed to the KIAA1199-driven CRC liver metastasis. Mechanistically, KIAA1199 activated the TGFβ signaling pathway by interacting with the TGFBR1/2 to stimulate CXCL1 and CXCL3 production, thereby driving the aggregation of immunosuppressive neutrophils. Genetic blockade or pharmacologic inhibition of KIAA1199 restored tumor immune infiltration, impeded tumor progression, and potentiated response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings indicated that KIAA1199 could facilitate the liver infiltration of immunosuppressive neutrophils via the TGFβ-chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)3/1-CXCR2 axis, which might be clinically targeted for the treatment of hepatic metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was primarily identified as a novel disease causing acute respiratory syndrome. However, as the pandemic progressed various cases of secondary organ infection and damage by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported, including a breakdown of the vascular barrier. As SARS-CoV-2 gains access to blood circulation through the lungs, the virus is first encountered by the layer of endothelial cells and immune cells that participate in host defense. Here, we developed an approach to study SARS-CoV-2 infection using vasculature-on-a-chip. We first modeled the interaction of virus alone with the endothelialized vasculature-on-a-chip, followed by the studies of the interaction of the virus exposed-endothelial cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In an endothelial model grown on a permeable microfluidic bioscaffold under flow conditions, both human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 presence diminished endothelial barrier function by disrupting VE-cadherin junctions and elevating the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and angiopoietin-2. Inflammatory cytokine markers were markedly more elevated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to HCoV-NL63 infection. Introduction of PBMCs with monocytes into the vasculature-on-a-chip upon SARS-CoV-2 infection further exacerbated cytokine-induced endothelial dysfunction, demonstrating the compounding effects of inter-cellular crosstalk between endothelial cells and monocytes in facilitating the hyperinflammatory state. Considering the harmful effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial cells, even without active virus proliferation inside the cells, a potential therapeutic approach is critical. We identified angiopoietin-1 derived peptide, QHREDGS, as a potential therapeutic capable of profoundly attenuating the inflammatory state of the cells consistent with the levels in non-infected controls, thereby improving the barrier function and endothelial cell survival against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of PBMC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adverse Mechanical Ventilation and Pneumococcal Pneumonia Induce Immune and Mitochondrial Dysfunctions Mitigated by Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Rabbits</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34965287/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Mechanical ventilation for pneumonia may contribute to lung injury due to factors that include mitochondrial dysfunction, and mesenchymal stem cells may attenuate injury. This study hypothesized that mechanical ventilation induces immune and mitochondrial dysfunction, with or without pneumococcal pneumonia, that could be mitigated by mesenchymal stem cells alone or combined with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male rabbits underwent protective mechanical ventilation (8 ml/kg tidal volume, 5 cm H2O end-expiratory pressure) or adverse mechanical ventilation (20 ml/kg tidal-volume, zero end-expiratory pressure) or were allowed to breathe spontaneously. The same settings were then repeated during pneumococcal pneumonia. Finally, infected animals during adverse mechanical ventilation received human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (3 × 106/kg, intravenous) and/or ceftaroline (20 mg/kg, intramuscular) or sodium chloride, 4 h after pneumococcal challenge. Twenty-four-hour survival (primary outcome), lung injury, bacterial burden, immune and mitochondrial dysfunction, and lung transcriptomes (secondary outcomes) were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; High-pressure adverse mechanical ventilation reduced the survival of infected animals (0%; 0 of 7) compared with spontaneous breathing (100%; 7 of 7) and protective mechanical ventilation (86%; 6 of 7; both _P &amp;lt; 0.001), with higher lung pathology scores (median [interquartile ranges], 5.5 [4.5 to 7.0] vs. 12.6 [12.0 to 14.0]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.046), interleukin-8 lung concentrations (106 [54 to 316] vs. 804 [753 to 868] pg/g of lung; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012), and alveolar mitochondrial DNA release (0.33 [0.28 to 0.36] vs. 0.98 [0.76 to 1.21] ng/μl; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with infected spontaneously breathing animals. Survival (0%; 0 of 7; control group) was improved by mesenchymal stem cells (57%; 4 of 7; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001) or ceftaroline alone (57%; 4 of 7; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and improved even more with a combination treatment (86%; 6 of 7; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Mesenchymal stem cells reduced lung pathology score (8.5 [7.0 to 10.5] vs. 12.6 [12.0 to 14.0]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.043) and alveolar mitochondrial DNA release (0.39 (0.34 to 0.65) vs. 0.98 (0.76 to 1.21) ng/μl; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.025). Mesenchymal stem cells combined with ceftaroline reduced interleukin-8 lung concentrations (665 [595 to 795] vs. 804 [753 to 868] pg/g of lung; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007) compared to ceftaroline alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In this preclinical study, mesenchymal stem cells improved the outcome of rabbits with pneumonia and high-pressure mechanical ventilation by correcting immune and mitochondrial dysfunction and when combined with the antibiotic ceftaroline was synergistic in mitigating lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important human pathogen and a paradigm of viral immune evasion, targeting intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immunity. We have employed two orthogonal multiplexed tandem mass tag-based proteomic screens to identify host proteins down-regulated by viral factors expressed during the latest phases of viral infection. This approach revealed that the HIV-1 restriction factor Schlafen-11 (SLFN11) was degraded by the poorly characterized, late-expressed HCMV protein RL1, via recruitment of the Cullin4-RING E3 Ubiquitin Ligase (CRL4) complex. SLFN11 potently restricted HCMV infection, inhibiting the formation and spread of viral plaques. Overall, we show that a restriction factor previously thought only to inhibit RNA viruses additionally restricts HCMV. We define the mechanism of viral antagonism and also describe an important resource for revealing additional molecules of importance in antiviral innate immunity and viral immune evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The volume-regulated anion channel LRRC8C suppresses T cell function by regulating cyclic dinucleotide transport and STING-p53 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35105987/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is formed by LRRC8 proteins and is responsible for the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) after hypotonic cell swelling. Besides chloride, VRAC transports other molecules, for example, immunomodulatory cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) including 2&#39;3&amp;rsquo;cGAMP. Here, we identify LRRC8C as a critical component of VRAC in T cells, where its deletion abolishes VRAC currents and RVD. T cells of &lt;em&gt;Lrrc8c&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice have increased cell cycle progression, proliferation, survival, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and cytokine production-a phenotype associated with downmodulation of p53 signaling. Mechanistically, LRRC8C mediates the transport of 2&#39;3&amp;rsquo;cGAMP in T cells, resulting in STING and p53 activation. Inhibition of STING recapitulates the phenotype of LRRC8C-deficient T cells, whereas overexpression of p53 inhibits their enhanced T cell function. &lt;em&gt;Lrrc8c&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice have exacerbated T cell-dependent immune responses, including immunity to influenza A virus infection and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our results identify cGAMP uptake through LRRC8C and STING-p53 signaling as a new inhibitory signaling pathway in T cells and adaptive immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFNγ and GM-CSF control complementary differentiation programs in the monocyte-to-phagocyte transition during neuroinflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35102344/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During inflammation, Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes are rapidly mobilized from the bone marrow (BM) and are recruited into inflamed tissues, where they undergo monocyte-to-phagocyte transition (MTPT). The in vivo developmental trajectories of the MTPT and the contribution of individual cytokines to this process remain unclear. Here, we used a murine model of neuroinflammation to investigate how granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interferon-γ (IFNγ), two type 1 cytokines, controlled MTPT. Using genetic fate mapping, gene targeting and high-dimensional single-cell multiomics analyses, we found that IFNγ was essential for the gradual acquisition of a mature inflammatory phagocyte phenotype in Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes, while GM-CSF was required to license interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production, phagocytosis and oxidative burst. These results suggest that the proinflammatory cytokine environment guided MTPT trajectories in the inflamed central nervous system (CNS) and indicated that GM-CSF was the most prominent target for the disarming of monocyte progenies during neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>m6A modifications regulate intestinal immunity and rotavirus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35098923/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant mRNA modification and affects many biological processes. However, how m6A levels are regulated during physiological or pathological processes such as virus infections, and the in vivo function of m6A in the intestinal immune defense against virus infections are largely unknown. Here, we uncover a novel antiviral function of m6A modification during rotavirus (RV) infection in small bowel intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). We found that rotavirus infection induced global m6A modifications on mRNA transcripts by down-regulating the m6a eraser ALKBH5. Mice lacking the m6A writer enzymes METTL3 in IECs (&lt;em&gt;Mettl3&lt;/em&gt;ΔIEC) were resistant to RV infection and showed increased expression of interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Using RNA-sequencing and m6A RNA immuno-precipitation (RIP)-sequencing, we identified IRF7, a master regulator of IFN responses, as one of the primary m6A targets during virus infection. In the absence of METTL3, IECs showed increased &lt;em&gt;Irf7&lt;/em&gt; mRNA stability and enhanced type I and III IFN expression. Deficiency in IRF7 attenuated the elevated expression of IFNs and ISGs and restored susceptibility to RV infection in &lt;em&gt;Mettl3&lt;/em&gt;ΔIEC mice. Moreover, the global m6A modification on mRNA transcripts declined with age in mice, with a significant drop from 2 weeks to 3 weeks post birth, which likely has broad implications for the development of intestinal immune system against enteric viruses early in life. Collectively, we demonstrated a novel host m6A-IRF7-IFN antiviral signaling cascade that restricts rotavirus infection &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OTUD7B deubiquitinates SQSTM1/p62 and promotes IRF3 degradation to regulate antiviral immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35100065/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deubiquitination plays an important role in the regulation of the crosstalk between macroautophagy/autophagy and innate immune signaling, yet its regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we identify the deubiquitinase OTUD7B as a negative regulator of antiviral immunity by targeting IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) for selective autophagic degradation. Mechanistically, OTUD7B interacts with IRF3, and activates IRF3-associated cargo receptor SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) by removing its K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains at lysine 7 (K7) to enhance SQSTM1 oligomerization. Moreover, viral infection increased the expression of OTUD7B, which forms a negative feedback loop by promoting IRF3 degradation to balance type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Taken together, our study reveals a specific role of OTUD7B in mediating the activation of cargo receptors in a substrate-dependent manner, which could be a potential target against excessive immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Procalcitonin is expressed in osteoblasts and limits bone resorption through inhibition of macrophage migration during intermittent PTH treatment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermittent injections of parathyroid hormone (iPTH) are applied clinically to stimulate bone formation by osteoblasts, although continuous elevation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) primarily results in increased bone resorption. Here, we identified &lt;em&gt;Calca&lt;/em&gt;, encoding the sepsis biomarker procalcitonin (ProCT), as a novel target gene of PTH in murine osteoblasts that inhibits osteoclast formation. During iPTH treatment, mice lacking ProCT develop increased bone resorption with excessive osteoclast formation in both the long bones and axial skeleton. Mechanistically, ProCT inhibits the expression of key mediators involved in the recruitment of macrophages, representing osteoclast precursors. Accordingly, ProCT arrests macrophage migration and causes inhibition of early but not late osteoclastogenesis. In conclusion, our results reveal a potential role of osteoblast-derived ProCT in the bone microenvironment that is required to limit bone resorption during iPTH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects in vitro and in vivo of hesperidin administration in an experimental model of acute lung inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a tool used in critical patient care. However, it can trigger inflammatory and oxidative processes capable of causing or aggravating lung injuries, which is known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Hesperidin is a flavonoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in various diseases. The role of hesperidin in the process triggered by MV is poorly studied. Thus, we hypothesize hesperidin could protect the lung of mice submitted to mechanical ventilation. For that, we evaluated cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in macrophages using different hesperidin concentrations. We observed hesperidin did not reduce cell viability, however; it attenuated the production of intracellular ROS in cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We further evaluated the effects of hesperidin in vivo in animals submitted to MV. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, there were higher levels of macrophage, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts in animals submitted to MV, indicating an inflammatory process. In the lung tissue, MV induced oxidative damage and increased myeloperoxidase activity, though the antioxidant enzyme activity decreased. MV also induced the production of the inflammatory mediators CCL-2, TNF-α and IL-12. Pretreatment with hesperidin resulted in less recruitment of inflammatory cells to the airways and less oxidative damage. Also, it reduced the formation of CCL-2 and IL-12. Our results show pretreatment with hesperidin can protect the lungs of mice submitted to mechanical ventilation by modulating the inflammatory response and redox imbalance and may act to prevent MV injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-15p-5p Mediates the Coordination of ICAM-1 and FAK to Promote Endothelial Cell Proliferation and Migration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35079920/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in endothelial cells is critical for neutrophil adhesion and transmigration across the endothelium. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which controls the turnover of focal adhesion to regulate cell adhesion and migration, plays a role in the resolution of inflammation. However, the coordinated involvement of ICAM-1 and FAK during endothelial inflammation has yet to be elucidated. This study reports that, as part of an inflammatory response, ICAM-1 controls FAK expression in endothelial cells via the microRNA miR-15b-5p. Induction of lung injury by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in higher levels of FAK expression in inflammatory tissues, while in ICAM-1 knockout mice, FAK expression was reduced in the lungs. FAK expression was also reduced in endothelial cells following ICAM-1 siRNA downregulation. Furthermore, ICAM-1 inhibited miR-15b-5p expression while increasing FAK mRNA and protein expression via binding of miR-15b-5p to the 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated region (UTR) of FAK. ICAM-1 inhibited miR-15b-5p promoter activity and hence reduced miR-15b-5p expression. FAK increased endothelial cell proliferation and migration, whereas miR-15b-5p inhibited cell proliferation and migration. These findings indicate that the inflammatory molecule ICAM-1 regulates FAK expression via miR-15b-5p levels, which in turn controls endothelial cell proliferation and migration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA regulatory molecules that play an important role in the development and function of immune cells. MicroRNA-26a (miR-26a) exhibits anti-inflammatory immune effects on immune cells. However, the exact mechanism by which miR-26a plays an anti-inflammatory role remains unclear. Here, we report that miR-26a reduces inflammatory response via inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by targeting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We found that miR-26a was downregulated in vitro and in vivo. The miR-26a mimic significantly decreased COX-2 protein levels, further inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We predicted that miR-26a could potentially target COX-2 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Computational algorithms showed that the 3&amp;rsquo;-UTR of COX-2 mRNA contains a binding site for miR-26a. This putative targeting relationship between miR-26a and COX-2 was further confirmed by a dual-reporter gene assay. The anti-inflammatory effects of the miR-26a mimic were diminished by PGE2 supplementation. Importantly, miR-26a mimics protected mice from lethal endotoxic shock and attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Collectively, these results suggest that miR-26a may function as a novel feedback negative regulator of the hyperinflammatory response and as a drug target for the progression of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel nordihydroguaiaretic acid analog, compound 3a, alleviates acute lung injury by exerting antiapoptotic and antiinflammatory effects</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a continuum of pulmonary changes caused by various lung insults. Previously, we synthesized a series of nordihydroguaiaretic acid analogs; of these, compound 3a exhibited excellent antioxidant capacity in a murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. However, it remains unclear whether compound 3a can modulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. ALI was induced via tracheal LPS administration, and the pathological changes were assessed. The level of inflammation was verified by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses. Apoptosis was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assays and Western blotting. Changes in the levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway proteins were assessed by immunofluorescence assays and Western blotting. In vitro, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with compound 3a prior to LPS challenge, and the intracellular level of inflammation was assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Relevant proteins were detected via immunofluorescence assays and Western blotting. Mice developed extensive lung inflammation by 24 h after LPS challenge. Histological examination revealed signs typical of ALI. Preadministration of compound 3a markedly ameliorated the histopathological changes and reduced fluid exudation into the alveolar space. Compound 3a also greatly reduced the levels of inflammation and apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, compound 3a markedly reduced phosphorylation of MAPK/NF-κB pathway-related proteins and p65 translocation, consistent with the in vitro observations. In summary, administration of compound 3a prior to LPS suppressed ALI via inhibition of the MAPK/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cell Origin and iNOS Function Are Critical to Macrophage Activation Following Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35145401/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the intratracheal bleomycin (ITB) model of acute lung injury (ALI), macrophages are recruited to the lung and participate in the inflammation and resolution that follows injury. Macrophage origin is influential in determining activation; however, the specific phenotype of recruited and resident macrophages is not known. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALI; however, the effects of its inhibition are mixed. Here we examined how macrophage origin determines the phenotypic response to ALI. Further, we hypothesize cell specific iNOS is key to determining activation and recruitment. Using a chimeric mouse approach, we have identified recruited and resident macrophage populations. We also used the chimeric mouse approach to create either pulmonary or bone marrow NOS2-/- mice and systemically inhibited iNOS via 1400 W. We evaluated macrophage populations at the peak of inflammation (8 days) and the beginning of resolution (15 days) following ITB. These studies demonstrate tissue resident macrophages adopt a M2 phenotype specifically, but monocyte originated macrophages activate along a spectrum. Additionally, we demonstrated that monocyte originating macrophage derived iNOS is responsible for recruitment to the lung during the inflammatory phase. Further, we show that macrophage activation is dependent upon cellular origin. Finally, these studies suggest pulmonary derived iNOS is detrimental to the lung following ITB. In conclusion, macrophage origin is a key determinant in response to ALI and iNOS is central to recruitment and activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 NSP5 and N protein counteract the RIG-I signaling pathway by suppressing the formation of stress granules</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35075101/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a highly pathogenic human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has to counteract an intricate network of antiviral host responses to establish infection and spread. The nucleic acid-induced stress response is an essential component of antiviral defense and is closely related to antiviral innate immunity. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 regulates the stress response pathway to achieve immune evasion remains elusive. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 NSP5 and N protein were found to attenuate antiviral stress granule (avSG) formation. Moreover, NSP5 and N suppressed IFN expression induced by infection of Sendai virus or transfection of a synthetic mimic of dsRNA, poly (I:C), inhibiting TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylation, and restraining the nuclear translocalization of IRF3. Furthermore, HEK293T cells with ectopic expression of NSP5 or N protein were less resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus infection. Mechanistically, NSP5 suppressed avSG formation and disrupted RIG-I-MAVS complex to attenuate the RIG-I-mediated antiviral immunity. In contrast to the multiple targets of NSP5, the N protein specifically targeted cofactors upstream of RIG-I. The N protein interacted with G3BP1 to prevent avSG formation and to keep the cofactors G3BP1 and PACT from activating RIG-I. Additionally, the N protein also affected the recognition of dsRNA by RIG-I. This study revealed the intimate correlation between SARS-CoV-2, the stress response, and innate antiviral immunity, shedding light on the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myeloid mineralocorticoid receptors contribute to skeletal muscle repair in muscular dystrophy and acute muscle injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35044859/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppressing mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activity with MR antagonists is therapeutic for chronic skeletal muscle pathology in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mouse models. Although mechanisms underlying clinical MR antagonist efficacy for DMD cardiomyopathy and other cardiac diseases are defined, mechanisms in skeletal muscles are not fully elucidated. Myofiber MR knockout improves skeletal muscle force and a subset of dystrophic pathology. However, MR signaling in myeloid cells is known to be a major contributor to cardiac efficacy. To define contributions of myeloid MR in skeletal muscle function and disease, we performed parallel assessments of muscle pathology, cytokine levels, and myeloid cell populations resulting from myeloid MR genetic knockout in muscular dystrophy and acute muscle injury. Myeloid MR knockout led to lower levels of C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-expressing macrophages, resulting in sustained myofiber damage after acute injury of normal muscle. In acute injury, myeloid MR knockout also led to increased local muscle levels of the enzyme that produces the endogenous MR agonist aldosterone, further supporting important contributions of MR signaling in normal muscle repair. In muscular dystrophy, myeloid MR knockout altered cytokine levels differentially between quadriceps and diaphragm muscles, which contain different myeloid populations. Myeloid MR knockout led to higher levels of fibrosis in dystrophic diaphragm. These results support important contributions of myeloid MR signaling to skeletal muscle repair in acute and chronic injuries and highlight the useful information gained from cell-specific genetic knockouts to delineate mechanisms of pharmacological efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human Dermcidin Protects Mice Against Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Local and Remote Inflammatory Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35095926/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Hepatic ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury is commonly associated with surgical liver resection or transplantation, and represents a major cause of liver damage and graft failure. Currently, there are no effective therapies to prevent hepatic I/R injury other than ischemic preconditioning and some preventative strategies. Previously, we have revealed the anti-inflammatory activity of a sweat gland-derived peptide, dermcidin (DCD), in macrophage/monocyte cultures. Here, we sought to explore its therapeutic potential and protective mechanisms in a murine model of hepatic I/R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to hepatic ischemia by clamping the hepatic artery and portal vein for 60 min, which was then removed to initiate reperfusion. At the beginning of reperfusion, 0.2 ml saline control or solution of DCD (0.5 mg/kg BW) or DCD-C34S analog (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg BW) containing a Cys (C)→Ser (S) substitution at residue 34 was injected via the internal jugular vein. For survival experiments, mice were subjected to additional resection to remove non-ischemic liver lobes, and animal survival was monitored for 10 days. For mechanistic studies, blood and tissue samples were collected at 24 h after the onset of reperfusion, and subjected to measurements of various markers of inflammation and tissue injury by real-time RT-PCR, immunoassays, and histological analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Recombinant DCD or DCD-C34S analog conferred a significant protection against lethal hepatic I/R when given intravenously at the beginning of reperfusion. This protection was associated with a significant reduction in hepatic injury, neutrophilic CXC chemokine (Mip-2) expression, neutrophil infiltration, and associated inflammation. Furthermore, the administration of DCD also resulted in a significant attenuation of remote lung inflammatory injury. Mechanistically, DCD interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a key regulator of liver inflammation, and significantly inhibited hepatic I/R-induced phosphorylation of EGFR as well as a downstream signaling molecule, protein kinase B (AKT). The suppression of EGFR expression by transducing Egfr-specific shRNA plasmid into macrophages abrogated the DCD-mediated inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production induced by a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), cold-inducible RNA-binding protein, CIRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The present study suggests that human DCD and its analog may be developed as novel therapeutics to attenuate hepatic I/R-induced inflammatory injury possibly by impairing EGFR signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An adapted passive model of anti-MPO dependent crescentic glomerulonephritis reveals matrix dysregulation and is amenable to modulation by CXCR4 inhibition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pathway analysis of the gene profiling microarray data demonstrates distinct activation of ECM-associated pathways in AAV patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We established and characterized an adapted and robust anti-MPO antibody-dependent murine AAV model that progresses from acute injury to glomerular and interstitial scarring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our AAV model presents already at the acute phase immune infiltrates, activation of immune cells, response to cytokine production and matrisomal changes that phenocopy very well the human pathology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We identified CXCR4 as an interesting therapeutical target that decreases the activation of immune cells in the acute phase of AAV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We developed and characterized a murine model of FNGN that recapitulates important clinical, histological and molecular features of human renal AAV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our model is suitable for studying chronic scarring injury and matrix remodeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provide a comprehensive analysis of inflammation and altered matrisome expression occurring early in injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We show that our model can be used for pharmacological studies and highlight CXCR4 as a potential target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are severe inflammatory disorders that often involve focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis (FNGN) and consequent glomerular scarring, interstitial fibrosis, and chronic kidney disease. Robust murine models of scarring in FNGN that may help to further our understanding of deleterious processes are still lacking. Here, we present a murine model of severe FNGN based on combined administration of antibodies against the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), that recapitulates acute injury and was adapted to investigate subsequent glomerular and interstitial scarring. Hematuria without involvement of other organs occurs consistently and rapidly, glomerular necrosis and crescent formation are evident at 12 days, and consequent glomerular and interstitial scarring at 29 days after initial treatment. Using mass-spectrometric proteome analysis, we provide a detailed overview of matrisomal and cellular changes in our model. We observed increased expression of the matrisome including collagens, fibronectin, tenascin-C, in accordance with human AAV as deduced from analysis of gene expression microarrays and tissue staining. Moreover, we observed tissue infiltration by neutrophils, macrophages, T cells and myofibroblasts upon injury. Experimental inhibition of CXCR4 using AMD3100 led to a sustained histological presence of fibrin extravasate, reduced chemokine expression and leukocyte activation, but did not markedly affect ECM composition. Altogether, we demonstrate an adapted FNGN model that enables the study of matrisomal changes both in disease and upon intervention, as exemplified via CXCR4 inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many viral infections including influenza. Therefore, there is a need for therapeutic interventions that dampen and redirect inflammatory responses and, ideally, exert antiviral effects. Itaconate is an immunomodulatory metabolite which also reprograms cell metabolism and inflammatory responses when applied exogenously. We evaluated effects of endogenous itaconate and exogenous application of itaconate and its variants dimethyl- and 4-octyl-itaconate (DI, 4OI) on host responses to influenza A virus (IAV). Infection induced expression of ACOD1, the enzyme catalyzing itaconate synthesis, in monocytes and macrophages, which correlated with viral replication and was abrogated by DI and 4OI treatment. In IAV-infected mice, pulmonary inflammation and weight loss were greater in Acod1-/- than in wild-type mice, and DI treatment reduced pulmonary inflammation and mortality. The compounds reversed infection-triggered interferon responses and modulated inflammation in human cells supporting non-productive and productive infection, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in human lung tissue. All three itaconates reduced ROS levels and STAT1 phosphorylation, whereas AKT phosphorylation was reduced by 4OI and DI but increased by itaconate. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified monocytes as the main target of infection and the exclusive source of ACOD1 mRNA in peripheral blood. DI treatment silenced IFN-responses predominantly in monocytes, but also in lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Ectopic synthesis of itaconate in A549 cells, which do not physiologically express ACOD1, reduced infection-driven inflammation, and DI reduced IAV- and IFNγ-induced CXCL10 expression in murine macrophages independent of the presence of endogenous ACOD1. The compounds differed greatly in their effects on cellular gene homeostasis and released cytokines/chemokines, but all three markedly reduced release of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL2 (MCP-1). Viral replication did not increase under treatment despite the dramatically repressed IFN responses. In fact, 4OI strongly inhibited viral transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the compounds reduced viral titers (4OI&amp;gt;Ita&amp;gt;DI) in A549 cells whereas viral transcription was unaffected. Taken together, these results reveal itaconates as immunomodulatory and antiviral interventions for influenza virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple respiratory viruses can concurrently or sequentially infect the respiratory tract and lead to virus‒virus interactions. Infection by a first virus could enhance or reduce infection and replication of a second virus, resulting in positive (additive or synergistic) or negative (antagonistic) interaction. The concept of viral interference has been demonstrated at the cellular, host, and population levels. The mechanisms involved in viral interference have been evaluated in differentiated airway epithelial cells and in animal models susceptible to the respiratory viruses of interest. A likely mechanism is the interferon response that could confer a temporary nonspecific immunity to the host. During the coronavirus disease pandemic, nonpharmacologic interventions have prevented the circulation of most respiratory viruses. Once the sanitary restrictions are lifted, circulation of seasonal respiratory viruses is expected to resume and will offer the opportunity to study their interactions, notably with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether berberine mediates its anti-inflammatory and blood sugar and lipid-lowering effects solely by adjusting the structure of the gut microbiota or by first directly regulating the expression of host pro-inflammatory proteins and activation of macrophages and subsequently acting on gut microbiota, is currently unclear. To clarify the mechanism of berberine-mediated regulation of metabolism, we constructed an obese mouse model using SPF-grade C57BL/6J male mice and conducted a systematic study of liver tissue pathology, inflammatory factor expression, and gut microbiota structure. We screened the gut microbiota targets of berberine and showed that the molecular mechanism of berberine-mediated treatment of metabolic syndrome involves the regulation of gut microbiota structure and the expression of inflammatory factors. Our results revealed that a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly changed mice gut microbiota, thereby probably increasing the level of toxins in the intestine, and triggered the host inflammatory response. The HFD also reduced the proportion of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing genes, thereby hindering mucosal immunity and cell nutrition, and increased the host inflammatory response and liver fat metabolism disorders. Further, berberine could improve the chronic HFD-induced inflammatory metabolic syndrome to some extent and effectively improved the metabolism of high-fat foods in mice, which correlated with the gut microbiota composition. Taken together, our study may improve our understanding of host-microbe interactions during the treatment of metabolic diseases and provide useful insights into the action mechanism of berberine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMPK/NFκB and NLRP3 interplay is a new therapeutic target in inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dapagliflozin mitigated lipopolysaccharide-mediated lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dapagliflozin anti-inflammatory effects were mediated through AMPK/NFĸB regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dapagliflozin inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is one the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. In this study, we examined for first time the role of dapagliflozin (DPGZ) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in rats and determined the underlying molecular mechanisms by evaluating the effects of DPGZ on adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK), nuclear transcription factor kappa B, nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor 3 inflammasome activation. Treatment of acute lung injured rats with either low dose (5 mg/kg) or high dose (10 mg/kg) DPGZ significantly decreased oxidative stress by decreasing malondialdehyde and nitric oxide tissue levels with a significant increase in spectrophotometric measurements of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and reduced glutathione levels. DPGZ treatment resulted in a significant anti-inflammatory effect as indicated by suppression in myeloperoxidase activity, MCP-1, IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α levels. DPGZ treatment also increased p-AMPK/t-AMPK with a significant reduction in NF-kB P65 binding activity and NFĸB p65 (pSer536) levels. These effects of DPGZ were accompanied by a significant reduction in NLRP3 levels and NLRP3 gene expression and a significant decrease in caspase-1 activity, which were also confirmed by histopathological examinations. We conclude that DPGZ antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity may occur through regulation of AMPK/NFĸB pathway and inhibition of NLRP3 activation. These results suggest that DPGZ represents a promising intervention for the treatment of ALI, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) has resulted in the global spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and an increase in complications including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Due to the lack of therapeutic options for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, recent attention has focused on differentiating hyper- and hypo-inflammatory phenotypes of ARDS to help define effective therapeutic strategies. Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has a role in neutrophil activation and has been identified within the pathogenesis and progression of this disease. The aim of this review is to highlight the role of IL-8 as a biomarker and prognostic factor in modulating the hyperinflammatory response in ARDS. The crucial role of IL-8 in lung inflammation and disease pathogenesis might suggest IL-8 as a possible new therapeutic target to efficiently modulate the hyperinflammatory response in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conformation of HIV-1 Envelope Governs Rhesus CD4 Usage and Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Virus Replication</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35012342/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infection of rhesus macaques with simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) is the preferred model system for vaccine development because SHIVs encode human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins (Envs)-a key target of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. Since the goal of vaccines is to prevent new infections, SHIVs encoding circulating HIV-1 Env are desired as challenge viruses. Development of such biologically relevant SHIVs has been challenging, as they fail to infect rhesus macaques, mainly because most circulating HIV-1 Envs do not use rhesus CD4 (rhCD4) receptor for viral entry. Most primary HIV-1 Envs exist in a closed conformation and occasionally transit to a downstream, open conformation through an obligate intermediate conformation. Here, we provide genetic evidence that open Env conformations can overcome the rhCD4 entry barrier and increase replication of SHIVs in rhesus lymphocytes. Consistent with prior studies, we found that circulating HIV-1 Envs do not use rhCD4 efficiently for viral entry. However, by using HIV-1 Envs with single amino acid substitutions that alter their conformational state, we found that transitions to intermediate and open Env conformations allow usage of physiological levels of rhCD4 for viral entry. We engineered these single amino acid substitutions in the transmitted/founder HIV-1BG505 Envs encoded by SHIV-BG505 and found that open Env conformation enhances SHIV replication in rhesus lymphocytes. Lastly, CD4-mediated SHIV pulldown, sensitivity to soluble CD4, and fusogenicity assays indicated that open Env conformation promotes efficient rhCD4 binding and viral-host membrane fusion. These findings identify the conformational state of HIV-1 Env as a major determinant for rhCD4 usage, viral fusion, and SHIV replication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhesus macaques are a critical animal model for preclinical testing of HIV-1 vaccine and prevention approaches. However, HIV-1 does not replicate in rhesus macaques, and thus, chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs), which encode HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), are used as surrogate challenge viruses to infect rhesus macaques for modeling HIV-1 infection. Development of SHIVs encoding Envs from clinically relevant, circulating HIV-1 variants has been extremely challenging, as such SHIVs replicate poorly, if at all, in rhesus lymphocytes. This is most probably because many circulating HIV-1 Envs do not use rhesus CD4 efficiently for viral entry. In this study, we identified conformational state of HIV-1 envelope as a key determinant for rhesus CD4 usage, viral-host membrane fusion, and SHIV replication in rhesus lymphocytes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomes derived from adipose-derived stem cells alleviate cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammation and injury by inhibiting alveolar macrophages pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35016678/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a frequently encountered disease condition in clinical practice mainly caused by cigarette smoke (CS). The aim of this study was to investigate the protective roles of human adipose-derived stem cells-derived exosomes (ADSCs-Exo) in CS-induced lung inflammation and injury and explore the underlying mechanism by discovering the effects of ADSCs-Exo on alveolar macrophages (AMs) pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; ADSCs were isolated from human adipose tissues harvested from three healthy donors, and then ADSCs-Exo were isolated. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, 24 age-matched male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to CS for 4 weeks, followed by intratracheal administration of ADSCs-Exo or phosphate buffered saline. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, MH-S cells, derived from mouse AMs, were stimulated by 2% CS extract (CSE) for 24 h, followed by the treatment of ADSCs-Exo or phosphate buffered saline. Pulmonary inflammation was analyzed by detecting pro-inflammatory cells and mediators in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Lung histology was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Mucus production was determined by Alcian blue-periodic acid-Schiff staining. The profile of AMs pyroptosis was evaluated by detecting the levels of pyroptosis-indicated proteins. The inflammatory response in AMs and the phagocytic activity of AMs were also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In mice exposed to CS, the levels of pro-inflammatory cells and mediators were significantly increased, mucus production was markedly increased and lung architecture was obviously disrupted. AMs pyroptosis was elevated and AMs phagocytosis was inhibited. However, the administration of ADSCs-Exo greatly reversed these alterations caused by CS exposure. Consistently, in MH-S cells with CSE-induced properties modelling those found in COPD, the cellular inflammatory response was elevated, the pyroptotic activity was upregulated while the phagocytosis was decreased. Nonetheless, these abnormalities were remarkably alleviated by the treatment of ADSCs-Exo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; ADSCs-Exo effectively attenuate CS-induced airway mucus overproduction, lung inflammation and injury by inhibiting AMs pyroptosis. Therefore, hADSCs-Exo may be a promising cell-free therapeutic candidate for CS-induced lung inflammation and injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrative omics analysis identifies biomarkers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial lung disease characterized by chronic progressive pulmonary fibrosis and a poor prognosis. Genetic studies, including transcriptomic and proteomics, have provided new insight into revealing mechanisms of IPF. Herein we provided a novel strategy to identify biomarkers by integrative analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of IPF patients. We examined the landscape of IPF patients&amp;rsquo; gene expression in the transcription and translation phases and investigated the expression and functions of two new potential biomarkers. Differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs were mainly enriched in pathways associated with immune system activities and inflammatory responses, while DE proteins are related to extracellular matrix production and wound repair. The upregulated genes in both phases are associated with wound repair and cell differentiation, while the downregulated genes in both phases are associated with reduced immune activities and the damage of the alveolar tissues. On this basis, we identified thirteen potential marker genes. Among them, we validated the expression changes of butyrophilin-like 9 (BTNL9) and plasmolipin (PLLP) and investigated their functional pathways in the IPF mechanism. Both genes are downregulated in the tissues of IPF patients and Bleomycin-induced mice, and co-expression analysis indicates that they have a protective effect by inhibiting extracellular matrix production and promoting wound repair in alveolar epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MRSA-induced endothelial permeability and acute lung injury are attenuated by FTY720 S-phosphonate</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35015568/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disruption of the lung endothelial barrier is a hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which no effective pharmacologic treatments exist. Prior work has demonstrated that FTY720 S-phosphonate (Tys), an analog of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and FTY720, exhibits potent endothelial cell (EC) barrier protective properties. In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of Tys against methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA), a frequent bacterial cause of ARDS. Tys-protected human lung EC from barrier disruption induced by heat-killed MRSA (HK-MRSA) or staphylococcal α-toxin and attenuated MRSA-induced cytoskeletal changes associated with barrier disruption, including actin stress fiber formation and loss of peripheral VE-cadherin and cortactin. Tys-inhibited Rho and myosin light chain (MLC) activation after MRSA and blocked MRSA-induced NF-κB activation and release of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8. In vivo, intratracheal administration of live MRSA in mice caused significant vascular leakage and leukocyte infiltration into the alveolar space. Pre- or posttreatment with Tys attenuated MRSA-induced lung permeability and levels of alveolar neutrophils. Posttreatment with Tys significantly reduced levels of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) VCAM-1 and plasma IL-6 and KC induced by MRSA. Dynamic intravital imaging of mouse lungs demonstrated Tys attenuation of HK-MRSA-induced interstitial edema and neutrophil infiltration into lung tissue. Tys did not directly inhibit MRSA growth or viability in vitro. In conclusion, Tys inhibits lung EC barrier disruption and proinflammatory signaling induced by MRSA in vitro and attenuates acute lung injury induced by MRSA in vivo. These results support the potential utility of Tys as a novel ARDS therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Citrulline depletion by ASS1 is required for proinflammatory macrophage activation and immune responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35016033/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrulline can be converted into argininosuccinate by argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) in the urea cycle and the citrulline-nitric oxide cycle. However, the regulation and biological function of citrulline metabolism remain obscure in the immune system. Unexpectedly, we found that macrophage citrulline declines rapidly after interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, which is required for efficient proinflammatory signaling activation. Mechanistically, IFN-γ and/or LPS stimulation promotes signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1)-mediated ASS1 transcription and Janus kinase2 (JAK2)-mediated phosphorylation of ASS1 at tyrosine 87, thereby leading to citrulline depletion. Reciprocally, increased citrulline directly binds to JAK2 and inhibits JAK2-STAT1 signaling. Blockage of ASS1-mediated citrulline depletion suppresses the host defense against bacterial infection in vivo. We therefore define a central role for ASS1 in controlling inflammatory macrophage activation and antibacterial defense through depletion of cellular citrulline and, further, identify citrulline as an innate immune-signaling metabolite that engages a metabolic checkpoint for proinflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) represents a frequent sepsis-induced inflammatory disorder. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) elicit anti-inflammatory effects in sepsis. This study investigated the mechanism of exosomes from adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) in sepsis-induced ALI. The IL-27r&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; (WSX-1 knockout) or wild-type mouse model of sepsis was established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The model mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages were treated with ADMSC-exosomes. The content of Dil-labeled exosomes in pulmonary macrophages, macrophages CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in whole lung tissues, and IL-27 content in macrophages were detected. The mRNA expression and protein level of IL27 subunits P28 and EBI3 in lung tissue and the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β were measured. The pulmonary edema, tissue injury, and pulmonary vascular leakage were measured. In vitro, macrophages internalized ADMSC-exosomes, and ADMSC-exosomes inhibited IL-27 secretion in LPS-induced macrophages. In vivo, IL-27 knockout attenuated CLP-induced ALI. ADMSC-exosomes suppressed macrophage aggregation in lung tissues and inhibited IL-27 secretion. ADMSC-exosomes decreased the contents of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, reduced pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular leakage, and improved the survival rate of mice. Injection of recombinant IL-27 reversed the protective effect of ADMSC-exosomes on sepsis mice. Collectively, ADMSC-exosomes inhibited IL-27 secretion in macrophages and alleviated sepsis-induced ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PGC-1α inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome via preserving mitochondrial viability to protect kidney fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35013155/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by mitochondrial damage and contributes to kidney fibrosis. However, it is unknown whether PGC-1α, a key mitochondrial biogenesis regulator, modulates NLRP3 inflammasome in kidney injury. Primary renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) were isolated from C57BL/6 mice. The NLRP3 inflammasome, mitochondrial dynamics and morphology, oxidative stress, and cell injury markers were examined in RTECs treated by TGF-β1 with or without Ppargc1a plasmid, PGC-1α activator (metformin), and siPGC-1α. In vivo, adenine-fed and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice were treated with metformin. In vitro, TGF-β1 treatment to RTECs suppressed the expressions of PGC-1α and mitochondrial dynamic-related genes. The NLRP3 inflammasome was also activated and the expression of fibrotic and cell injury markers was increased. PGC-1α induction with the plasmid and metformin improved mitochondrial dynamics and morphology and attenuated the NLRP3 inflammasome and cell injury. The opposite changes were observed by siPGC-1α. The oxidative stress levels, which are inducers of the NLRP3 inflammasome, were increased and the expression of TNFAIP3, a negative regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome regulated by PGC-1α, was decreased by TGF-β1 and siPGC-1α. However, PGC-1α restoration reversed these alterations. In vivo, adenine-fed and UUO mice models showed suppression of PGC-1α and TNFAIP3 and dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics. Moreover, the activation of oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome, and kidney fibrosis were increased in these mice. However, these changes were significantly reversed by metformin. This study demonstrated that kidney injury was ameliorated by PGC-1α-induced inactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via modulation of mitochondrial viability and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound 270, a self-developed NF-κB inhibitor, possess anti-inflammation activity in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NF-κB inhibitor 270 has protective effects against LPS-induced septic AKI and ALI in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NF-κB inhibitor 270 is a potential candidate medicine in the treatment of AKI and ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NF-κB inhibitor 270 could be used in inflammatory associated diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute lung injury (ALI) have high morbidity and mortality, with no effective clinically available drugs. Anti-inflammation is effective strategy in the therapy of AKI and ALI. NF-κB is a target for the development of anti‑inflammatory agents. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of 270, self-developed NF-κB inhibitor, in LPS-induced AKI and ALI. LPS-induced macrophages were used to examine the anti-inflammation activity of 270 in vitro. Sepsis-induced AKI and ALI mice models were established by intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10 mg/kg) for 24 h. Oral administration 270 for 14 days before LPS stimulation. Plasma, kidney and lung tissues were collected and used for histopathology, biochemical assay, ELISA, RT-PCR, and western blot analyses. In vitro, we showed that 270 suppressed the inflammation response in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages and bone marrow derived macrophages. In vivo, we found that 270 ameliorated LPS-induced AKI and ALI, as evidenced by improving various pathological changes, reducing the expression of pro-inflammation genes, blocking the activation of NF-κB and JNK pathways, attenuating the elevated myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, ameliorating the activated ER stress, reversing the inhibition effect on autophagy in kidney and lung tissues, and alleviating the enhanced plasma level of creatinine (Crea), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and pro-inflammation cytokines. Our investigations provides evidence that NF-κB inhibitor 270 is a potential drug that against LPS-induced AKI and ALI in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STAT6/VDR Axis Mitigates Lung Inflammatory Injury by Promoting Nrf2 Signaling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35047105/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung inflammatory injury is a global public health concern. It is characterized by infiltration of diverse inflammatory cells and thickening of pulmonary septum along with oxidative stress to airway epithelial cells. STAT6 is a nuclear transcription factor that plays a crucial role in orchestrating the immune response, but its function in tissue inflammatory injury has not been comprehensively studied. Here, we demonstrated that STAT6 activation can protect against particle-induced lung inflammatory injury by resisting oxidative stress. Specifically, genetic ablation of STAT6 was observed to worsen particle-induced lung injury mainly by disrupting the lungs&amp;rsquo; antioxidant capacity, as reflected by the downregulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, an increase in malondialdehyde levels, and a decrease in glutathione levels. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been previously proved to positively regulate Nrf2 signals. In this study, silencing VDR expression in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells consistently suppressed autophagy-mediated activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, thereby aggravating particle-induced cell damage. Mechanically, STAT6 activation promoted the nuclear translocation of VDR, which increased the transcription of autophagy-related genes and induced Nrf2 signals, and silencing VDR abolished these effects. Our research provides important insights into the role of STAT6 in oxidative damage and reveals its potential underlying mechanism. This information not only deepens the appreciation of STAT6 but also opens new avenues for the discovery of therapies for inflammatory respiratory system disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diverse facets of MDSC in different phases of chronic HBV infection: Impact on HBV-specific T-cell response and homing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35000202/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic HBV infection (CHI) is associated with a diverse natural history that includes immune-tolerant (IT), HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) (EP-CHB), inactive carrier, and HBeAg-negative CHB (EN-CHB) phases. A hallmark of CHI is impairment of HBV-specific T-cell response. Recently, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have emerged as key regulator of T cells, and their properties are sculpted by their microenvironment. Here, we investigated the distinctive features of MDSCs during CHI, identified factors responsible for their functional discrepancies, and studied their impact on HBV-specific T-cell response and homing. Influence of antiviral therapy on MDSC profile and T-cell response was also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt; Flow cytometric analysis indicated that MDSCs in EP-CHB/EN-CHB patients had profound suppressive ability, expressing arginase 1 (Arg1)/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4)/CD40 at significantly greater levels relative to healthy controls (HC). However, in IT, only Arg1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MDSCs and in inactive carrier, iNOS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and PD-L1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MDSCs were higher than HC. In vitro assays demonstrated that high HBsAg titer in IT/CHB induced Arg1+ MDSC. Furthermore, elevated serum TNF-α and IL-4 in CHB potentiated Arg1/PD-L1/CD40/CTLA-4 expression, whereas increased IL-1β in CHB/IC triggered the expansion of PD-L1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MDSCs and iNOS+ MDSCs. MDSCs, sorted from CHB/IC, greatly attenuated IL-2/interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production by HBV-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, the effect being more pronounced in CHB. However, MDSCs of IT minimally affected the cytokine production by T cells. Adding Arg1-/iNOS-inhibitor restored only IFN-γ production, while neutralizing PD-L1 recovered both IL-2 and IFN-γ secretion by T cells. Moreover, MDSCs from IT/CHB disrupted virus-specific T-cell trafficking by down-regulating chemokine receptor type 5 on them via TGF-β signaling. One year of tenofovir therapy failed to normalize MDSC phenotype and HBV-specific T-cell response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Diversity of MDSCs during CHI affects HBV-specific T-cell response and homing. Hence, therapeutic targeting of MDSCs could boost anti-HBV immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MCMV-based vaccine vectors expressing full-length viral proteins provide long-term humoral immune protection upon a single-shot vaccination</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34992275/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global pandemics caused by influenza or coronaviruses cause severe disruptions to public health and lead to high morbidity and mortality. There remains a medical need for vaccines against these pathogens. CMV (cytomegalovirus) is a β-herpesvirus that induces uniquely robust immune responses in which remarkably large populations of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are maintained for a lifetime. Hence, CMV has been proposed and investigated as a novel vaccine vector for expressing antigenic peptides or proteins to elicit protective cellular immune responses against numerous pathogens. We generated two recombinant murine CMV (MCMV) vaccine vectors expressing hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus (MCMVHA) or the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (MCMVS). A single injection of MCMVs expressing either viral protein induced potent neutralizing antibody responses, which strengthened over time. Importantly, MCMVHA-vaccinated mice were protected from illness following challenge with the influenza virus, and we excluded that this protection was due to the effects of memory T cells. Conclusively, we show here that MCMV vectors induce not only long-term cellular immunity but also humoral responses that provide long-term immune protection against clinically relevant respiratory pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibrotic lung disease inhibits immune responses to staphylococcal pneumonia via impaired neutrophil and macrophage function</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34990413/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease characterized by collagen deposition within the lung interstitium. Bacterial infection is associated with increased morbidity and more rapid mortality in IPF patient populations, and pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are commonly isolated from the lungs of hospitalized patients with IPF. Despite this, the effects of fibrotic lung injury on critical immune responses to infection remain unknown. In the present study, we show that, like humans with IPF, fibrotic mice infected with MRSA exhibit increased morbidity and mortality compared with uninfected fibrotic mice. We determine that fibrosis conferred a defect in MRSA clearance compared with nonfibrotic mice, resulting from blunted innate immune responses. We show that fibrosis inhibited neutrophil intracellular killing of MRSA through impaired neutrophil elastase release and oxidative radical production. Additionally, we demonstrate that lung macrophages from fibrotic mice have impaired phagocytosis of MRSA. Our study describes potentially novel impairments of antimicrobial responses upon pulmonary fibrosis development, and our findings suggest a possible mechanism for why patients with IPF are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality related to infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A purine metabolic checkpoint that prevents autoimmunity and autoinflammation</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A FAMIN-enabled purine metabolon in dendritic cells restrains T cell priming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FAMIN prevents cytoplasmic NADH/NAD+ reductive stress that enhances priming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inosine generated from hypoxanthine by FAMIN inhibits T cell priming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FAMIN ameliorates immunopathology in influenza but dampens tumor surveillance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still&amp;rsquo;s disease, the paradigm of autoinflammation-cum-autoimmunity, predisposes for a cytokine storm with excessive T lymphocyte activation upon viral infection. Loss of function of the purine nucleoside enzyme FAMIN is the sole known cause for monogenic Still&amp;rsquo;s disease. Here we discovered that a FAMIN-enabled purine metabolon in dendritic cells (DCs) restrains CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell priming. DCs with absent FAMIN activity prime for enhanced antigen-specific cytotoxicity, IFNγ secretion, and T cell expansion, resulting in excessive influenza A virus-specific responses. Enhanced priming is already manifest with hypomorphic FAMIN-I254V, for which ∼6% of mankind is homozygous. FAMIN controls membrane trafficking and restrains antigen presentation in an NADH/NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner by balancing flux through adenine-guanine nucleotide interconversion cycles. FAMIN additionally converts hypoxanthine into inosine, which DCs release to dampen T cell activation. Compromised FAMIN consequently enhances immunosurveillance of syngeneic tumors. FAMIN is a biochemical checkpoint that protects against excessive antiviral T cell responses, autoimmunity, and autoinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WC-Co exposure induces inflammatory response and apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WC-Co stimulation increases PTX3 expression in vivo and the trend is paralleled with the lung inflammation severity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apoptotic cells exhibited higher levels of PTX3 on the surface of the membrane after WC-Co treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PTX3 on the surface of apoptotic cells membrane efficiently facilitates efferocytosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged exposure to hard metal dust results in hard metal lung disease (HMLD) characterized by respiratory symptoms. Understanding the pathogenesis and pathological process of HMLD would be helpful for its early diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we established a mouse model of hard metal-induced acute lung injury through one-time intratracheal instillation of WC-Co dust suspension. We found that WC-Co treatment damaged the lungs of mice, leading to increased production of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-18, inflammatory cells infiltration and apoptosis. In vitro, WC-Co induced cytotoxicity, inflammatory response and apoptosis in macrophages (PMA-treated THP-1) and epithelial cells (A549) in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, RNA-sequence and validation experiments verified that Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), an important mediator in the regulation of inflammation, was elevated both in vivo and in vitro induced by WC-Co. Functional experiments confirmed the PTX3, which was located on the membrane of apoptotic cells, promoted macrophage efferocytosis efficiently. This progress could help block the lung inflammation and contribute to the rapid recovery of WC-Co-induced acute lung injury. These observations provide a further understanding of the molecular mechanism of WC-Co-induced pulmonary injury and disclose PTX3 as a new potential therapeutic approach to relieve WC-Co-induced acute lung injury via efferocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trained immunity induction by the inactivated mucosal vaccine MV130 protects against experimental viral respiratory infections</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MV130 is an inactivated polybacterial mucosal vaccine that confers protection to patients against recurrent respiratory infections, including those of viral etiology. However, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we find that intranasal prophylaxis with MV130 modulates the lung immune landscape and provides long-term heterologous protection against viral respiratory infections in mice. Intranasal administration of MV130 provides protection against systemic candidiasis in wild-type and Rag1-deficient mice lacking functional lymphocytes, indicative of innate immune-mediated protection. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of trained immunity with metformin abrogates the protection conferred by MV130 against influenza A virus respiratory infection. MV130 induces reprogramming of both mouse bone marrow progenitor cells and in vitro human monocytes, promoting an enhanced cytokine production that relies on a metabolic shift. Our results unveil that the mucosal administration of a fully inactivated bacterial vaccine provides protection against viral infections by a mechanism associated with the induction of trained immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phospholipase A2 inhibitor and LY6/PLAUR domain-containing protein PINLYP regulates type I interferon innate immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34969857/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses serve as the first line of the host innate immune defense against viral infection. Here we identify a previously uncharacterized protein designated phospholipase A2 inhibitor and LY6/PLAUR domain-containing protein (PINLYP), which is essential for embryonic development and plays an important role in type I IFN against pathogen infection. PINLYP deficiency impairs type I IFN production and dampens in vivo host defense against DNA and RNA virus infection. We unravel a unique actor in the type I IFN innate immunity and a potential target for the antiviral therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferons (IFNs) are the first frontline of the host innate immune response against invading pathogens. Herein, we characterized an unknown protein encoded by phospholipase A2 inhibitor and LY6/PLAUR domain-containing (PINLYP) gene that interacted with TBK1 and induced type I IFN in a TBK1- and IRF3-dependent manner. Loss of PINLYP impaired the activation of IRF3 and production of IFN-β induced by DNA virus, RNA virus, and various Toll-like receptor ligands in multiple cell types. Because PINLYP deficiency in mice engendered an early embryonic lethality in mice, we generated a conditional mouse in which PINLYP was depleted in dendritic cells. Mice lacking PINLYP in dendritic cells were defective in type I IFN induction and more susceptible to lethal virus infection. Thus, PINLYP is a positive regulator of type I IFN innate immunity and important for effective host defense against viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Renal and Cerebral Hypoxia and Inflammation During Cardiopulmonary Bypass</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury and brain injury remain common despite ongoing efforts to improve both the equipment and procedures deployed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The pathophysiology of injury of the kidney and brain during CPB is not completely understood. Nevertheless, renal (particularly in the medulla) and cerebral hypoxia and inflammation likely play critical roles. Multiple practical factors, including depth and mode of anesthesia, hemodilution, pump flow, and arterial pressure can influence oxygenation of the brain and kidney during CPB. Critically, these factors may have differential effects on these two vital organs. Systemic inflammatory pathways are activated during CPB through activation of the complement system, coagulation pathways, leukocytes, and the release of inflammatory cytokines. Local inflammation in the brain and kidney may be aggravated by ischemia (and thus hypoxia) and reperfusion (and thus oxidative stress) and activation of resident and infiltrating inflammatory cells. Various strategies, including manipulating perfusion conditions and administration of pharmacotherapies, could potentially be deployed to avoid or attenuate hypoxia and inflammation during CPB. Regarding manipulating perfusion conditions, based on experimental and clinical data, increasing standard pump flow and arterial pressure during CPB appears to offer the best hope to avoid hypoxia and injury, at least in the kidney. Pharmacological approaches, including use of anti-inflammatory agents such as dexmedetomidine and erythropoietin, have shown promise in preclinical models but have not been adequately tested in human trials. However, evidence for beneficial effects of corticosteroids on renal and neurological outcomes is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TNF-α Induces Neutrophil Apoptosis Delay and Promotes Intestinal Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Lung Injury through Activating JNK/FoxO3a Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35003520/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Intestinal ischemia is a common clinical critical illness. Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IIR) leads to acute lung injury (ALI), but the causative factors of ALI are unknown. The aim of this study was to reveal the causative factors and mechanisms of IIR-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A mouse model of IIR was developed using C57BL/6 mice, followed by detection of lung injury status and plasma levels of inflammatory factors in sham-operated mice and model mice. Some model mice were treated with a tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor lenalidomide (10 mg/kg), followed by observation of lung injury status through hematoxylin and eosin staining and detection of neutrophil infiltration levels through naphthol esterase and Ly6G immunohistochemical staining. Additionally, peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were cultured &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and then stimulated by TNF-α to mimic &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; inflammatory stimuli; this TNF-α stimulation was also performed on PMNs after knockdown of FoxO3a or treatment with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. PMN apoptosis after stimulation was detected using flow cytometry. Finally, the role of PMN apoptosis in IIR-induced lung injury was evaluated in vivo by detecting the ALI status in the model mice administered with ABT-199, a Bcl-2 inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; IIR led to pulmonary histopathological injury and increased lung water content, which were accompanied by increased plasma levels of inflammatory factors, with the TNF-α plasma level showing the most pronounced increase. Inhibition of TNF-α led to effective reduction of lung tissue injury, especially that of the damaging infiltration of PMNs in the lung. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; knockdown of FoxO3a or inhibition of JNK activity could inhibit TNF-α-induced PMN apoptosis. Further &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments revealed that ABT-199 effectively alleviated lung injury and decreased inflammation levels by promoting PMN apoptosis during IIR-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; TNF-α activates the JNK/FoxO3a pathway to induce a delay in PMN apoptosis, which promotes IIR-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory infected by COVID-19 represents a major global health problem at moment even after recovery from virus corona. Since, the lung lesions for infected patients are still sufferings from acute respiratory distress syndrome including alveolar septal edema, pneumonia, hyperplasia, and hyaline membranes Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify additional candidates having ability to overcome inflammatory process and can enhance efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. The polypenolic extracts were integrated into moeties of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then were coated by chitosan as a mucoadhesion polymer. The results of interleukin-6, and c-reactive protein showed significant reduction in group treated by Encap. SIL + CUR (64 ± 0.8 Pg/μL &amp;amp; 6 ± 0.5 μg/μL) compared to group treated by Cham. + CUR (102 ± 0.8 Pg/μL &amp;amp; 7 ± 0.5 μg/μL) respectively and free capsules (with no any drug inside) (148 ± 0.6 Pg/μL &amp;amp; 10 ± 0.6 μg/μL) respectively. Histopathology profile was improved completely. Additionally, encapsulating silymarin showed anti-viral activity in vitro COVID-19 experiment. It can be summarized that muco-inhalable delivery system (MIDS) loaded by silymarin can be used to overcome inflammation induced by oleic acid and to overcome COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astragaloside IV pre-treatment attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats: Impact on autophagy, apoptosis and inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35026504/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35026504/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autophagy flux inhibition is a critical mechanism of PM2.5-induced lung toxicity in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 triggered pulmonary inflammation by tipping the balance between autophagy and apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV increased autophagic flux and inhibited apoptosis and inflammation by activation of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in a PM2.5-induced rat lung toxicity model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm, exerts serious lung toxicity. At present, effective prevention measures and treatment modalities for pulmonary toxicity caused by PM2.5 are lacking. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is a natural product that has received increasing attention from researchers for its unique biological functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate the protective effects of AS-IV on PM2.5-induced pulmonary toxicity and identify its potential mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The rat model of PM2.5-induced lung toxicity was created by intratracheal instillation of PM2.5 dust suspension. The investigation was performed with AS-IV or in combination with autophagic flux inhibitor (Chloroquine) or AMP-sensitive protein kinase (AMPK)-specific inhibitor (Compound C). Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxy-nucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and western blotting. Autophagy was detected by immunofluorescence staining, autophagic flux measurement, western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy. The AMPK/mTOR pathway was analyzed by western blotting. Inflammation was analyzed by western blotting and suspension array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; AS-IV prevented histopathological injury, inflammation, autophagy dysfunction, apoptosis, and changes in AMPK levels induced by PM2.5. AS-IV increased autophagic flux and inhibited apoptosis and inflammation by activating the AMPK/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. However, AS-IV had no protective effect on PM2.5-induced lung injury following treatment with Compound C or Chloroquine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; AS-IV prevented PM2.5-induced lung toxicity by restoring the balance among autophagy, apoptosis, and inflammation in rats by activating the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free fatty acids-induced neutrophil extracellular traps lead to dendritic cells activation and T cell differentiation in acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34959222/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate whether free fatty acids (FFAs) could induce the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), as well as the mechanism of FFAs-induced NETs in acute lung injury (ALI). FFAs were used to induce NETs production. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was detected after FFA and NADPH oxidase inhibitor treatments. The association between FFAs-induced NETs and the activation of p38, ERK, and JNK pathways was investigated. The effect of FFAs-induced NETs on the dendritic cells (DCs) activation and T cell differentiation was investigated. FFAs could induce neutrophils to produce NETs. FFAs significantly promoted ROS production and increased the expression of ERK, p38 and JNK, and treatment of the inhibitors of NAPDH oxidase (DPI), p38 (SB202190), ERK1/2 (U0126) and JNK (SP600125) inhibited FAAs-induced NETs production. FFAs induced NETs could promote DCs activation and consequently led to the differentiation of primary CD4+ T cells into Th1 and Th17 cells and the release of IL-1β, IL-12 and TNF-α. FFAs are capable of inducing NETs via NOX, ERK, p38 and JNK pathways. FFA-induced NETs further lead to DCs activation and T cell differentiation, which can well explain the mechanism of ALI caused by FFAs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self-Delivery Janus-Prodrug for Precise Immuno-Chemotherapy of Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34958191/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromatized thioketal (ATK) linked the immunoregulatory molecule (budesonide, Bud) and the cytotoxic molecule (gemcitabine, Gem) to construct a ROS-activated Janus-prodrug, termed as BAG. Benefiting from the hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and other intermolecular interactions, BAG could self-assemble into nanoaggregates (BAG NA) with a well-defined spherical shape and uniform size distribution. Compared to the carrier-based drug delivery system, BAG NA have ultrahigh drug loading content and ROS concentration-dependent drug release. Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) is a typical disease in which chronic inflammation transforms into tumors. BAG NA can be internalized by colon cancer C26 cells and then triggered by excessive intracellular ROS to release nearly 100% of the drugs. Based on this, BAG NA showed a stronger pro-apoptotic effect than free Bud combined with free Gem. What is gratifying is that orally administered BAG NA can precisely accumulate in the diseased colon tissues of CAC mice induced by AOM/DSS and simultaneously release Bud and Gem. Bud can regulate the tumor immune microenvironment to restore and enhance the cytotoxicity of Gem. Therefore, BAG NA maximizes the synergistic therapeutic effect through co-delivery of Bud and Gem. This work provided a cutting-edge method for constructing self-delivery Janus-prodrug based on ATK and confirmed its potential application in inflammation-related carcinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disulfiram attenuates MCMV-Induced pneumonia by inhibition of NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway in immunocompromised mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34959186/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disulfiram (DSF) attenuated MCMV-infected pneumonia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSF suppressed NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway in MCMV-infected mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSF inhibited inflammatory response in MCMV-infected BMDMs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSF reduced viral loads in MCMV-infected mice and BMDMs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals is associated with damaging hyperinflammation and leads to high morbidity and mortality. It is urgently needed to develop new strategies to treat CMV-induced pneumonia. As disulfiram (DSF) reportedly inhibits inflammatory responses in different disease models, its therapeutic effects in CMV-induced pneumonia are proposed. In this study, we demonstrated that DSF effectively attenuated pulmonary injury and improved survival in murine CMV (MCMV) pneumonia model. DSF treatment inhibited lung inflammatory responses, e.g. reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokine, and lowering the accumulation of leukocytes in the lung. Similar to the in vivo results, DSF attenuated inflammatory responses and modulated NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in MCMV-infected BMDMs. Furthermore, DSF reduced pulmonary fibrosis and viral loads in MCMV pneumonia mice and BMDMs. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory effects of DSF may due to its regulating NF-κB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Collectively, our results suggest that DSF-mediated anti-hyperinflammatory effects have potentials for therapy of human CMV pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DDR1 contributes to kidney inflammation and fibrosis by promoting the phosphorylation of BCR and STAT3</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34941574/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by collagen, contributes to chronic kidney disease. However, its role in acute kidney injury and subsequent development of kidney fibrosis is not clear. Thus, we performed a model of severe ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury that progressed to kidney fibrosis in WT and Ddr1-null mice. We showed that Ddr1-null mice had reduced acute tubular injury, inflammation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis with overall decreased renal monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) levels and STAT3 activation. We identified breakpoint cluster region (BCR) protein as a phosphorylated target of DDR1 that controls MCP-1 production in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. DDR1-induced BCR phosphorylation or BCR downregulation increased MCP-1 secretion, suggesting that BCR negatively regulates the levels of MCP-1. Mechanistically, phosphorylation or downregulation of BCR increased β-catenin activity and in turn MCP-1 production. Finally, we showed that DDR1-mediated STAT3 activation was required to stimulate the secretion of TGF-β. Thus, DDR1 contributes to acute and chronic kidney injury by regulating BCR and STAT3 phosphorylation and in turn the production of MCP-1 and TGF-β. These findings identify DDR1 an attractive therapeutic target for ameliorating both proinflammatory and profibrotic signaling in kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anoikis is a programmed cell death occurring upon cell detachment from the correct extracellular matrix, thus disrupting integrin ligation. It is a critical mechanism in preventing dysplastic cell growth or attachment to an inappropriate matrix. Anoikis prevents detached epithelial cells from colonizing elsewhere and is thus essential for tissue homeostasis and development. As anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, two features associated with anoikis resistance, are crucial steps during tumour progression and metastatic spreading of cancer cells, anoikis deregulation has now evoked particular attention from the scientific community. The aim of this review is to analyse the molecular mechanisms governing both anoikis and anoikis resistance, focusing on their regulation in physiological processes, as well as in several diseases, including metastatic cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance:&lt;/em&gt; Peucedanum praeruptorum seed root is a common medicinal herb with antipyretic, expectorant, antitussive, and therapeutic effects against bronchitis and furuncle. The roots of this herb contain many coumarin compounds, including pteryxin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim of this study:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate whether pteryxin can alleviate the LPS-induced lung injury and the mechanism involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Material and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male BALB/C mice were orally given sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na) (0.5%, 1mL/100g) and pteryxin (suspended in CMC-Na; 0.5%) at 5, 10, 25 mg/kg once daily for 7 days. Subsequently, the mice received a single intratracheal instillation of 5 mg/kg LPS or saline as the control. After 8 hours, the mice were sacrificed to collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues. These samples were used to determine the lung W/D (wet/dry) weight ratio, total protein (TP) levels, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) and expression of protein involved in MAPK/NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome. H&amp;amp;E staining was carried out on tissue sections to explore the pathological alterations induced by LPS. The protein expression of F4/80 and NLRP3 in lung tissues was analyzed using immunohistochemical staining. The binding of pteryxin to target proteins (MAPK, NF-κB and NLRP3) was determined based on molecular docking tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Treatment with pteryxin reduced the lung W/D weight ratio, total protein (TP) level and levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1 β) significantly. Therefore, it ameliorated LPS-induced inflammatory response in BALB/C mice. Moreover, pteryxin suppressed LPS-induced upregulation of proteins involved in MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The expression level of F4/80 and NLRP3 was also downregulated by pteryxin pretreatment in lung tissues. Docking analysis revealed that pteryxin bound to target proteins (MAPK, NF- κB and NLRP3) with a fit-well pattern .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Pteryxin may attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury by dampening MAPK/NF-κB signaling and NLRP 3 inflammasome activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STING-Mediated Interferon Induction by Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Requires the Protein Tyrosine Kinase Syk</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34933455/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature and the intensity of innate immune response to virus infection determine the course of pathogenesis in the host. Among the many pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors, STING, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein, plays a pivotal role in triggering responses to microbial or cellular cytoplasmic DNA. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a common human pathogen, activates STING signaling, and the resultant induction of type I interferon causes inhibition of virus replication. In this context, we have observed that phosphorylation of Tyr245 of STING by epidermal growth factor receptor kinase is necessary for interferon induction. Here, we report that phosphorylation of Tyr240 by the tyrosine kinase Syk is essential for all signaling activities of STING. Our analysis showed that upon ligand-binding, STING dimerizes and interacts with membrane-bound EGFR, which autophosphorylates and provides the platform for the recruitment of cytoplasmic Syk to the signaling complex and its activation. Activated Syk phosphorylates Tyr240 of STING, followed by phosphorylation of Tyr245 by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Pharmacological or genetic ablation of Syk activity resulted in an arrest of STING in the ER compartment and a complete block of gene induction. Consequently, in the absence of Syk, HSV-1 could not induce interferon, and it replicated more robustly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune response to virus infection leads to interferon production and inhibition of viral replication. STING, an ER-bound protein, mediates such a response to cytoplasmic cellular or microbial DNA. HSV-1, a DNA virus, activates STING, and it replicates more efficiently in the absence of STING signaling. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tyr240 of STING by the protein tyrosine kinase Syk is essential for STING-mediated gene induction. To signal, ligand-activated STING recruits two kinases, Syk and EGFR, which phosphorylate Tyr240 and Tyr245, respectively. The dependence of STING signaling on Syk has broad significance, because STING plays a major role in many microbial, mitochondrial, and autoimmune diseases as well as in cancer development and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A detrimental role of NLRP6 in host iron metabolism during Salmonella infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34942528/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining host iron homeostasis is an essential component of nutritional immunity responsible for sequestrating iron from pathogens and controlling infection. Nucleotide-oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) contribute to cytoplasmic sensing and antimicrobial response orchestration. However, it remains unknown whether and how NLRs may regulate host iron metabolism, an important component of nutritional immunity. Here, we demonstrated that NLRP6, a member of the NLR family, has an unconventional role in regulating host iron metabolism that perturbs host resistance to bacterial infection. NLRP6 deficiency is advantageous for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis in both macrophages and enterocytes through increasing the unique iron exporter ferroportin-mediated iron efflux in a nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-dependent manner. Additional studies uncovered a novel mechanism underlying NRF2 regulation and operating through NLRP6/AKT interaction and that causes a decrease in AKT phosphorylation, which in turn reduces NRF2 nuclear translocation. In the absence of NLRP6, increased AKT activation promotes NRF2/KEAP1 dissociation via increasing mTOR-mediated p62 phosphorylation and downregulates KEAP1 transcription by promoting FOXO3A phosphorylation. Together, our observations provide new insights into the mechanism of nutritional immunity by revealing a novel function of NLRP6 in regulating iron metabolism, and suggest NLRP6 as a therapeutic target for limiting bacterial iron acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RBC-hitchhiking chitosan nanoparticles loading methylprednisolone for lung-targeting delivery</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34933051/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyper-inflammation associated with cytokine storm syndrome causes high mortality in patients with COVID-19. Glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS), effectively inhibit this inflammatory response. However, frequent and chronic administration of glucocorticoids at high doses leads to hormone dependence and serious side effects. The aim of the present study was to combine nanoparticles with erythrocytes for the targeted delivery of MPSS to the lungs. Chitosan nanoparticles loading MPSS (MPSS-CSNPs) were prepared and adsorbed on the surface of red blood cells (RBC-MPSS-CSNPs) by non-covalent interaction. In vivo pharmacokinetic study indicated that RBC-hitchhiking could significantly reduce the plasma concentration of the drug and prolong the circulation time. The mean residence time (MRT) and area under the curve (AUC) of the RBC-MPSS-CSNPs group were significantly higher than those of the MPSS-CSNPs group and the MPSS injection group. Moreover, in vivo imaging and tissue distribution indicated that RBC-hitchhiking facilitated the accumulation of nanoparticles loading fluorescein in the lung, preventing uptake of these nanoparticles by the liver. Furthermore, compared with the MPSS-CSNPs and MPSS treatment groups, treatment with RBC-MPSS-CSNPs considerably inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, and consequently attenuated lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide in rats. Therefore, RBC-hitchhiking is a potentially effective strategy for the delivery of nanoparticles to the lungs for the treatment of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell death forms an essential component of the antiviral immune response. Viral infection elicits different forms of host cell death, including the lytic and inflammatory cell death modes necroptosis or pyroptosis. The induction of both types of cell death not only eliminates virus-infected cells but also contributes to the development of innate and adaptive immunity through the release of inflammatory mediators. The importance of necroptosis and pyroptosis in host defence is evident from the numerous viral evasion mechanisms that suppress these cell death pathways. Here, we review the emerging principles by which viruses antagonise host cell necroptosis and pyroptosis to promote their spread and block host immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection results in impaired interferon response in patients with severe COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 interferes with host immune responses is incompletely understood. Here, we sequence small RNAs from SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells and identify a microRNA (miRNA) derived from a recently evolved region of the viral genome. We show that the virus-derived miRNA produces two miRNA isoforms in infected cells by the enzyme Dicer, which are loaded into Argonaute proteins. Moreover, the predominant miRNA isoform targets the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR of interferon-stimulated genes and represses their expression in a miRNA-like fashion. Finally, the two viral miRNA isoforms were detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 can potentially employ a virus-derived miRNA to hijack the host miRNA machinery, which could help to evade the interferon-mediated immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bioinspired design of mannose-decorated globular lysine dendrimers promotes diabetic wound healing by orchestrating appropriate macrophage polarization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of cytokines or growth factors have been used in the treatment of inflammation. However, they are highly dependent on an optimal delivery system with sufficient loading efficiency and protection of growth factors from proteolytic degradation. To develop the immunotherapy capacity of peptide dendrimers themselves, inspired by the structure and immunoregulatory functions of mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), we thus propose a hypothesis that mannose-decorated globular lysine dendrimers (MGLDs) with precise molecular design can elicit anti-inflammatory activity through targeting and reprogramming macrophages to M2 phenotype. To achieve this, a series of mannose-decorated globular lysine dendrimers (MGLDs) was developed. Size-controlled MGLDs obtained were spherical with positive surface charges. The mean size ranged from 50-200 nm in varying generations and modification degrees. The initial screening study revealed that MGLDs have superior biocompatibility. When cocultured with MGLDs, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) acquired an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype characterized by significant mannose receptor (MR) clustering on the cell surface and the elongated shape, an increased production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, a downregulated secretory of IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and increased ability to induce fibroblast proliferation. Then in vivo studies further demonstrated that topical administration of optimized MGLDs accelerates wound repair of full-thickness cutaneous defects in type 2 diabetic mice via M2 macrophage polarization. Mechanistically, MGLDs treatment showed an enhanced closure rate, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis, along with mitigated inflammation modulated by a suppressed secretory of pro-inflammation cytokines, and increased production of TGF-β1. These findings provide the first evidence that the bioinspired design of MGLDs can direct M2 macrophage polarization, which may be beneficial in the therapy of injuries and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is a common reaction product during heat processing and the preparation of many types of foods and Traditional Chinese Medicine formulations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of 5-HMF on endotoxin-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the underlying mechanisms. Our findings indicate that 5-HMF attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice by mitigating alveolar destruction, neutrophil infiltration and the release of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the activation of macrophages and human monocytes in response to LPS was remarkably suppressed by 5-HMF in vitro through inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The inhibitory effect of 5-HMF on NLRP3 inflammasome was reversed by overexpressing ATF4 or CHOP, indicating the involvement of ER stress in the negative regulation of 5-HMF on NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation. Consistent with this, the ameliorative effect of 5-HMF on in vivo pulmonary dysfunction were reversed by the ER stress inducer tunicamycin. In conclusion, our findings elucidate the anti-inflammatory and protective efficacy of 5-HMF in LPS-induced acute lung injury, and also demonstrate the key mechanism of its action against NLRP3 inflammasome-related inflammatory disorders via the inhibition of ER stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dimethyl fumarate attenuates LPS induced septic acute kidney injury by suppression of NFκB p65 phosphorylation and macrophage activation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Septic acute kidney injury (AKI) always accounts for high mortality of septic patients in ICU. Due to its not well understood mechanism for infection and immune-regulation in kidney dysfunction, there is a lack of effective therapy without side effects. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) as an immunomodulatory molecule has been approved for treatment to multiple sclerosis. However, the therapeutic effect and immunomodulatory role underlying DMF action in septic AKI is unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of DMF in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic AKI involving macrophage regulation. In current study, we administered DMF by oral gavage to mice with LPS-induced AKI, then harvested serum and kidney at three different time points. We further isolated Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from mice and stimulated them with LPS followed by DMF treatment. To explore immunomodulatory role of DMF in macrophages, we depleted macrophages in mice using liposomal clodronate after DMF treatment upon LPS-induced septic AKI. Then we observed that DMF attenuated renal dysfunction and murine pathological kidney injury after LPS injection. DMF could inhibit translocation of phosphorylated NF-κB p65 and suppress macrophage activation in LPS-induced AKI. DMF reduced the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 whereas increased the secretion of IL-10 and Arg-1 in BMDMs after LPS stimulation. DMF also inhibited NF-κB p65 phosphorylation in BMDMs after LPS stimulation. Importantly, the effect of DMF against LPS-induced AKI, macrophage activation, and translocation of phosphorylated NF-κB p65 was impaired upon macrophage depletion. Thus, DMF could attenuate LPS-induced septic AKI by suppression of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and macrophage activation. This work suggested the potential therapeutic role of DMF for patients in ICU threatened by septic AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus nsp4 positively regulates cellular cholesterol to inhibit type I interferon production</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellular cholesterol plays an important role in the life cycles of enveloped viruses. Previous studies by our group and other groups have demonstrated that the depletion of cellular cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) reduces the proliferation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a porcine Arterivirus that has been devastating the swine industry worldwide for over two decades. However, how PRRSV infection regulates cholesterol synthesis is not fully understood. In this study, we showed that PRRSV infection upregulated the activity of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), which subsequently activated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, to increase the levels of cellular cholesterol. By screening the PRRSV-encoded proteins, we showed that nsp4 dominated the upregulation of cellular cholesterol, independently of the 3C-like protease activity of nsp4. A mutation analysis showed that domain I (amino acids 1-80) of PRRSV nsp4 interacted with PR65 alpha (PR65α), the structural subunit, and PP2Ac, the catalytic subunit, of PP2A. Importantly, domain I of nsp4 inhibited Sendai virus-induced interferon β production, and this inhibitory effect was eliminated by Lovastatin, an HMGCR inhibitor, indicating that the upregulation of cellular cholesterol by nsp4 is a strategy used by PRRSV to suppress the antiviral innate immunity of its host. Collectively, we here demonstrated the mechanism by which PRRSV regulates cellular cholesterol synthesis and reported a novel strategy by which PRRSV evades its host&amp;rsquo;s antiviral innate immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3)-mediated ubiquitination and deubiquitinase (DUB)-mediated deubiquitination processes are closely associated with the occurrence and development of colonic inflammation. Ovarian tumor deubiquitinase 1 (OTUD1) is involved in immunoregulatory functions linked to infectious diseases. However, the effect of OTUD1 on intestinal immune responses during colonic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unclear. Here, we show that loss of OTUD1 in mice contributes to the pathogenesis of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis via excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that OTUD1 in hematopoietic cells plays a dominant role in protection against colitis. Mechanistically, OTUD1 physically interacts with receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and selectively cleaves K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIPK1 to inhibit the recruitment of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO). Moreover, the expression of OTUD1 in mucosa samples from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients was lower than that in mucosa samples from healthy controls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the UC-associated OTUD1 G430V mutation abolishes the ability of OTUD1 to inhibit RIPK1-mediated NF-κB activation and intestinal inflammation. Taken together, our study unveils a previously unexplored role of OTUD1 in moderating intestinal inflammation by inhibiting RIPK1-mediated NF-κB activation, suggesting that the OTUD1-RIPK1 axis could be a potential target for the treatment of IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fe-Curcumin Nanozyme-Mediated Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging and Anti-Inflammation for Acute Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumonia, such as acute lung injury (ALI), has been a type of lethal disease that is generally caused by uncontrolled inflammatory response and excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, we report Fe-curcumin-based nanoparticles (Fe-Cur NPs) with nanozyme functionalities in guiding the intracellular ROS scavenging and meanwhile exhibiting anti-inflammation efficacy for curing ALI. The nanoparticles are noncytotoxic when directing these biological activities. Mechanism studies for the anti-inflammation aspects of Fe-Cur NPs were systematically carried out, in which the infected cells and tissues were alleviated through downregulating levels of several important inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), decreasing the intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasomes, and suppressing NF-κB signaling pathways. In addition, we performed both the intratracheal and intravenous injection of Fe-Cur NPs in mice experiencing ALI and, importantly, found that the accumulation of such nanozymes was enhanced in lung tissue (better than free curcumin drugs), demonstrating its promising therapeutic efficiency in two different administration methods. We showed that the inflammation reduction of Fe-Cur NPs was effective in animal experiments and that ROS scavenging was also effectively achieved in lung tissue. Finally, we revealed that Fe-Cur NPs can decrease the level of macrophage cells (CD11b&lt;sup&gt;lo&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;) and CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in mice, which could help suppress the inflammation cytokine storm caused by ALI. Overall, this work has developed the strategy of using Fe-Cur NPs as nanozymes to scavenge intracellular ROS and as an anti-inflammation nanodrugs to synergistically cure ALI, which may serve as a promising therapeutic agent in the clinical treatment of this deadly disease. Fe-Cur NP nanozymes were designed to attenuate ALI by clearing intracellular ROS and alleviating inflammation synergistically. Relevant cytokines, inflammasomes, and signaling pathways were studied.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NLRP3 cages revealed by full-length mouse NLRP3 structure control pathway activation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NACHT-, leucine-rich-repeat- (LRR), and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is emerging to be a critical intracellular inflammasome sensor of membrane integrity and a highly important clinical target against chronic inflammation. Here, we report that an endogenous, stimulus-responsive form of full-length mouse NLRP3 is a 12- to 16-mer double-ring cage held together by LRR-LRR interactions with the pyrin domains shielded within the assembly to avoid premature activation. Surprisingly, this NLRP3 form is predominantly membrane localized, which is consistent with previously noted localization of NLRP3 at various membrane organelles. Structure-guided mutagenesis reveals that trans-Golgi network dispersion into vesicles, an early event observed for many NLRP3-activating stimuli, requires the double-ring cages of NLRP3. Double-ring-defective NLRP3 mutants abolish inflammasome punctum formation, caspase-1 processing, and cell death. Thus, our data uncover a physiological NLRP3 oligomer on the membrane that is poised to sense diverse signals to induce inflammasome activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19-induced &amp;ldquo;acute respiratory distress syndrome&amp;rdquo; (ARDS) is associated with prolonged respiratory failure and high mortality, but the mechanistic basis of lung injury remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyze pulmonary immune responses and lung pathology in two cohorts of patients with COVID-19 ARDS using functional single-cell genomics, immunohistology, and electron microscopy. We describe an accumulation of CD163-expressing monocyte-derived macrophages that acquired a profibrotic transcriptional phenotype during COVID-19 ARDS. Gene set enrichment and computational data integration revealed a significant similarity between COVID-19-associated macrophages and profibrotic macrophage populations identified in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. COVID-19 ARDS was associated with clinical, radiographic, histopathological, and ultrastructural hallmarks of pulmonary fibrosis. Exposure of human monocytes to SARS-CoV-2, but not influenza A virus or viral RNA analogs, was sufficient to induce a similar profibrotic phenotype in vitro. In conclusion, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 triggers profibrotic macrophage responses and pronounced fibroproliferative ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TRAF6 prevents fatal inflammation by homeostatic suppression of MALT1 protease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balanced control of T cell signaling is critical for adaptive immunity and protection from autoimmunity. By combining genetically engineered mouse models, biochemical analyses and pharmacological interventions, we describe an unexpected dual role of the tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6) E3 ligase as both a positive and negative regulator of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) paracaspase. Although MALT1-TRAF6 recruitment is indispensable for nuclear factor κB signaling in activated T cells, TRAF6 counteracts basal MALT1 protease activity in resting T cells. In mice, loss of TRAF6-mediated homeostatic suppression of MALT1 protease leads to severe autoimmune inflammation, which is completely reverted by genetic or therapeutic inactivation of MALT1 protease function. Thus, TRAF6 functions as a molecular brake for MALT1 protease in resting T cells and a signaling accelerator for MALT1 scaffolding in activated T cells, revealing that TRAF6 controls T cell activation in a switch-like manner. Our findings have important implications for development and treatment of autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NAMPT-derived NAD&#43; fuels PARP1 to promote skin inflammation through parthanatos cell death</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several studies have revealed a correlation between chronic inflammation and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism, but the precise mechanism involved is unknown. Here, we report that the genetic and pharmacological inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD+ biosynthesis, reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and keratinocyte DNA damage, hyperproliferation, and cell death in zebrafish models of chronic skin inflammation, while all these effects were reversed by NAD+ supplementation. Similarly, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase 1 (Parp1), overexpression of PAR glycohydrolase, inhibition of apoptosis-inducing factor 1, inhibition of NADPH oxidases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging all phenocopied the effects of Nampt inhibition. Pharmacological inhibition of NADPH oxidases/NAMPT/PARP/AIFM1 axis decreased the expression of pathology-associated genes in human organotypic 3D skin models of psoriasis. Consistently, an aberrant induction of NAMPT and PARP activity, together with AIFM1 nuclear translocation, was observed in lesional skin from psoriasis patients. In conclusion, hyperactivation of PARP1 in response to ROS-induced DNA damage, fueled by NAMPT-derived NAD+, mediates skin inflammation through parthanatos cell death.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Highway to heal: Influence of altered extracellular matrix on infiltrating immune cells during acute and chronic lung diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental insults including respiratory infections, in combination with genetic predisposition, may lead to lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung fibrosis, asthma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Common characteristics of these diseases are infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells and abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, leading to tissue damage and impairments in lung function. The ECM provides three-dimensional (3D) architectural support to the lung and crucial biochemical and biophysical cues to the cells, directing cellular processes. As immune cells travel to reach any site of injury, they encounter the composition and various mechanical features of the ECM. Emerging evidence demonstrates the crucial role played by the local environment in recruiting immune cells and their function in lung diseases. Moreover, recent developments in the field have elucidated considerable differences in responses of immune cells in two-dimensional versus 3D modeling systems. Examining the effect of individual parameters of the ECM to study their effect independently and collectively in a 3D microenvironment will help in better understanding disease pathobiology. In this article, we discuss the importance of investigating cellular migration and recent advances in this field. Moreover, we summarize changes in the ECM in lung diseases and the potential impacts on infiltrating immune cell migration in these diseases. There has been compelling progress in this field that encourages further developments, such as advanced in vitro 3D modeling using native ECM-based models, patient-derived materials, and bioprinting. We conclude with an overview of these state-of-the-art methodologies, followed by a discussion on developing novel and innovative models and the practical challenges envisaged in implementing and utilizing these systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is an essential transductor for initiation of many immune responses. Here, we show that lncRNA-ISIR directly binds IRF3 to promote its phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation, along with enhanced target gene productions. In vivo lncRNA-ISIR deficiency results in reduced IFN production, uncontrolled viral replication, and increased mortality. The human homolog, AK131315, also binds IRF3 and promotes its activation. More important, AK131315 expression is positively correlated with type I interferon (IFN-I) level and severity in patients with lupus. Mechanistically, in resting cells, IRF3 is bound to suppressor protein Flightless-1 (Fli-1), which keeps its inactive state. Upon infection, IFN-I-induced lncRNA-ISIR binds IRF3 at DNA-binding domain in cytoplasm and removes Fli-1&amp;rsquo;s association from IRF3, consequently facilitating IRF3 activation. Our results demonstrate that IFN-I-inducible lncRNA-ISIR feedback strengthens IRF3 activation by removing suppressive Fli-1 in immune responses, revealing a method of lncRNA-mediated modulation of transcription factor (TF) activation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytokine immunotherapy represents an attractive strategy to stimulate robust immune responses for renal injury repair in ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI). However, its clinical application is hindered by its nonspecificity to kidney, short circulation half-life, and severe side effects. An ideal cytokine immunotherapy for AKI requires preferential delivery of cytokines with accurate dosage to the kidney and sustained-release of cytokines to stimulate the immune responses. Herein, we developed a DNA nanoraft cytokine by precisely arranging interleukin-33 (IL-33) nanoarray on rectangle DNA origami, through which IL-33 can be preferentially delivered to the kidney for alleviation of AKI. A nanoraft carrying precisely quantified IL-33 predominantly accumulated in the kidney for up to 48 h. Long-term sustained-release of IL-33 from nanoraft induced rapid expansion of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC 2s) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and achieved better treatment efficiency compared to free IL-33 treatment. Thus, our study demonstrates that a nanoraft can serve as a structurally well-defined delivery platform for cytokine immunotherapy in ischemic AKI and other renal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NLRC4 inflammasome-dependent cell death occurs by a complementary series of three death pathways and determines lethality in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34678072/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammasome is an innate immune defense mechanism, but its overactivation can lead to host death. Here, we show that cell death dictates mouse death caused by NLRC4 inflammasome overactivation. To execute NLRC4-dependent cell death, three death paways complement each other in a specific order: Pyroptosis pathway requiring caspase-1 and GSDMD is the default path; impairment of it initiates ASC-mediated caspase-8–dependent apoptosis; when these two pathways are blocked, caspase-1 triggers intrinsthic apoptotic pathway. Blocking one or two of these death pathways inhibits induction of various cytokines and lipid mediators, but mice still succumb, and only genetic deletions that block all death paths prevent NLRC4-mediated cell death, tissue damage, and mice death. In addition, infection of nonpropagative &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt;-caused mice death is attenuated by blocking these death pathways. Thus, to reduce the lethality of infection-related diseases, preventing cell death might be necessary when propagation of infected pathogen was controlled by other means.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggers gasdermin D-independent inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34678046/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOD-like receptor (NLR), family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) assembles a protein complex known as the NLRP3 inflammasome upon sensing certain pathogen products or sterile danger signals. Gain-of-function mutations such as the D301N substitution in NLRP3, which cause its constitutive activation (NLRP3CA) also results in inflammasome assembly. This inflammasome processes pro–interleukin-1 β (pro–IL-1β) and pro–IL-18 into bioactive IL-1β and IL-18, respectively, and cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD). GSDMD amino-terminal fragments form plasma membrane pores that facilitate the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 and lead to the inflammatory cell death pyroptosis. Accordingly, GSDMD inactivation results in negligible spontaneous inflammation in various experimental models such as in &lt;em&gt;Nlrp3&lt;sup&gt;CA/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice lacking GSDMD (&lt;em&gt;Nlrp3&lt;sup&gt;CA/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Gsdmd&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice). Here, we found that &lt;em&gt;Nlrp3&lt;sup&gt;CA/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Gsdmd&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, when challenged with LPS or TNF-α, still secreted IL-1β and IL-18, indicating inflammasome activation independent of GSDMD. Accordingly, &lt;em&gt;Gsdmd&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; macrophages failed to secrete IL-1β and undergo pyroptosis when briefly exposed to NLRP3 inflammasome activators but released these cytokines when persistently activated. Sustained NLRP3 inflammasome induced caspase-8/-3 and GSDME cleavage and IL-1β maturation in vitro in &lt;em&gt;Gsdmd&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; macrophages. Thus, a salvage inflammatory pathway involving caspase-8/-3–GSDME was activated after NLRP3 activation when the canonical NLRP3-GSDMD signaling was blocked. Consistent with genetic data, the active metabolite of FDA-approved disulfiram CuET, which inhibited GSDMD and GSDME cleavage in macrophages, reduced the severe inflammation and tissue damage that occurred in the &lt;em&gt;Nlrp3&lt;sup&gt;CA/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Thus, NLRP3 inflammasome activation overwhelms the protection afforded by GSDMD deficiency, rewiring signaling cascades through mechanisms that include GSDME to propagate inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of a choroid plexus vascular barrier closing during intestinal inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to 40% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease present with psychosocial disturbances. We previously identified a gut vascular barrier that controls the dissemination of bacteria from the intestine to the liver. Here, we describe a vascular barrier in the brain choroid plexus (PVB) that is modulated in response to intestinal inflammation through bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide. The inflammatory response induces PVB closure after gut vascular barrier opening by the up-regulation of the wingless-type, catenin-beta 1 (Wnt/β-catenin) signaling pathway, rendering it inaccessible to large molecules. In a model of genetically driven closure of choroid plexus endothelial cells, we observed a deficit in short-term memory and anxiety-like behavior, suggesting that PVB closure may correlate with mental deficits. Inflammatory bowel disease–related mental symptoms may thus be the consequence of a deregulated gut–brain vascular axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phase separation drives RNA virus-induced activation of the NLRP6 inflammasome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34678144/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dsRNA induces liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of NLRP6 &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and in cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASC solidifies LLPS of NLRP6 and RNA to promote inflammasome activation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poly-Lysine region in NLRP6 is critical for multivalent interaction and LLPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase separation of NLRP6 promotes inflammasome activation in intestine and liver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NLRP6 is important in host defense by inducing functional outcomes including inflammasome activation and interferon production. Here, we show that NLRP6 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon interaction with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and in cells, and an intrinsically disordered poly-lysine sequence (K350-354) of NLRP6 is important for multivalent interactions, phase separation, and inflammasome activation. &lt;em&gt;Nlrp6&lt;/em&gt;-deficient or &lt;em&gt;Nlrp6&lt;sup&gt;K350-354A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mutant mice show reduced inflammasome activation upon mouse hepatitis virus or rotavirus infection, and in steady state stimulated by intestinal microbiota, implicating NLRP6 LLPS in anti-microbial immunity. Recruitment of ASC via helical assembly solidifies NLRP6 condensates, and ASC further recruits and activates caspase-1. Lipoteichoic acid, a known NLRP6 ligand, also promotes NLRP6 LLPS, and DHX15, a helicase in NLRP6-induced interferon signaling, co-forms condensates with NLRP6 and dsRNA. Thus, LLPS of NLRP6 is a common response to ligand stimulation, which serves to direct NLRP6 to distinct functional outcomes depending on the cellular context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cis-acting lnc-Cxcl2 restrains neutrophil-mediated lung inflammation by inhibiting epithelial cell CXCL2 expression in virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34607953/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemokine production by epithelial cells is important for neutrophil recruitment during viral infection, the appropriate regulation of which is critical for restraining inflammation and attenuating subsequent tissue damage. Epithelial cell expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), RNA-binding proteins, and their functional interactions during viral infection and inflammation remain to be fully understood. Here, we identified an inducible lncRNA in the &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; gene locus, lnc-Cxcl2, which could selectively inhibit &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; expression in mouse lung epithelial cells but not in macrophages. lnc-Cxcl2-deficient mice exhibited increased &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; expression, enhanced neutrophils recruitment, and more severe inflammation in the lung after influenza virus infection. Mechanistically, nucleus-localized lnc-Cxcl2 bound to &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; promoter, recruited a ribonucleoprotein La, which inhibited the chromatin accessibility of chemokine promoters, and consequently inhibited &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; transcription in cis However, unlike mouse lnc-Cxcl2, human lnc-CXCL2-4-1 inhibited multiple immune cytokine expressions including chemokines in human lung epithelial cells. Together, our results demonstrate a self-protecting mechanism within epithelial cells to restrain chemokine and neutrophil-mediated inflammation, providing clues for better understanding chemokine regulation and epithelial cell function in lung viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Degradation of WTAP blocks antiviral responses by reducing the m6A levels of IRF3 and IFNAR1 mRNA</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34467630/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) is a chemical modification present in multiple RNA species and is most abundant in mRNAs. Studies on m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A reveal its comprehensive roles in almost every aspect of mRNA metabolism, as well as in a variety of physiological processes. Although some recent discoveries indicate that m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A can affect the life cycles of numerous viruses as well as the cellular antiviral immune response, the roles of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification in type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling are still largely unknown. Here, we reveal that WT1-associated protein (WTAP), one of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A &amp;ldquo;writers&amp;rdquo;, is degraded via the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway upon activation of IFN-I signaling. With the degradation of WTAP, the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and interferon alpha/beta receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) mRNAs are reduced, leading to translational suppression of IRF3 and instability of IFNAR1 mRNA. Thus, the WTAP-IRF3/IFNAR1 axis may serve as negative feedback pathway to fine-tune the activation of IFN-I signaling, which highlights the roles of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A in the antiviral response by dictating the fate of mRNAs associated with IFN-I signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>African Swine Fever Virus E120R Protein Inhibits Interferon Beta Production by Interacting with IRF3 To Block Its Activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34190598/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African swine fever is a devastating disease of swine caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). The pathogenesis of the disease remains largely unknown, leaving the spread of the disease uncontrolled in many countries and regions. Here, we identified E120R, a structural protein of ASFV, as a key virulence factor and late-phase-expressed protein of the virus. E120R revealed an activity to suppress the host antiviral response through blocking beta interferon (IFN-β) production, and the amino acids (aa) at sites 72 and 73 (amino acids 72-73) in the C-terminal domain were essential for this function. E120R interacted with interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and interfered with the recruitment of IRF3 to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which in turn suppressed IRF3 phosphorylation, decreasing interferon production. A recombinant mutant ASFV was further constructed to confirm the claimed mechanism. The ASFV lacking the complete E120R region could not be rescued, whereas the virus could tolerate the deletion of the 72nd and 73rd residues in E120R (ASFV E120R-Δ72-73aa). ASFV E120R with the two-amino-acid deletion failed to interact with IRF3 during ASFV E120R-Δ72-73aa infection, and the viral infection activated IRF3 phosphorylation highly and induced more robust type I interferon production than its parental ASFV. An unbiased transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression also confirmed that considerably more IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were detected in ASFV E120R-Δ72-73aa-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) than in wild-type ASFV-infected PAMs. Together, our findings have identified a novel mechanism evolved by ASFV to inhibit the host antiviral response, and they provide a new target for guiding the development of ASFV live-attenuated vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African swine fever is a highly contagious animal disease affecting the pig industry worldwide, which has brought enormous economic losses. Infection by the causative agent, African swine fever virus (ASFV), causes severe immunosuppression during viral infection, contributing to serious clinical manifestations. Therefore, identification of the viral proteins involved in immunosuppression is critical for ASFV vaccine design and development. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated that E120R protein, a structural protein of ASFV, played an important role in suppression of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and type I interferon production by binding to IRF3 and blocking the recruitment of IRF3 to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Deletion of the crucial binding sites in E120R critically increased the interferon response during ASFV infection. This study explored a novel antagonistic mechanism of ASFV, which is critical for guiding the development of ASFV live-attenuated vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytokine storm induced by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major pathological feature of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a crucial determinant in COVID-19 prognosis. Understanding the mechanism underlying the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm is critical for COVID-19 control. Here, we identify that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and host hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) play key roles in the virus infection and pro-inflammatory responses. RNA sequencing shows that HIF-1α signaling, immune response, and metabolism pathways are dysregulated in COVID-19 patients. Clinical analyses indicate that HIF-1α production, inflammatory responses, and high mortalities occurr in elderly patients. HIF-1α and pro-inflammatory cytokines are elicited in patients and infected cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces mitochondrial damage and Mito-ROS production to promote HIF-1α expression, which subsequently facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokines production. Notably, HIF-1α also broadly promotes the infection of other viruses. Collectively, during SARS-CoV-2 infection, ORF3a induces HIF-1α, which in turn aggravates viral infection and inflammatory responses. Therefore, HIF-1α plays an important role in promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection and inducing pro-inflammatory responses to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammatory responses induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with severe symptoms of COVID-19. Inflammasomes activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are also associated with COVID-19 severity. Here, we show a distinct mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation to induce hyperinflammation. N protein facilitates maturation of proinflammatory cytokines and induces proinflammatory responses in cultured cells and mice. Mechanistically, N protein interacts directly with NLRP3 protein, promotes the binding of NLRP3 with ASC, and facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. More importantly, N protein aggravates lung injury, accelerates death in sepsis and acute inflammation mouse models, and promotes IL-1β and IL-6 activation in mice. Notably, N-induced lung injury and cytokine production are blocked by MCC950 (a specific inhibitor of NLRP3) and Ac-YVAD-cmk (an inhibitor of caspase-1). Therefore, this study reveals a distinct mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and induces excessive inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Control of gasdermin D oligomerization and pyroptosis by the Ragulator-Rag-mTORC1 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34289345/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of pyroptosis is mediated by inflammasomes and a downstream effector known as gasdermin D (GSDMD). Upon cleavage by inflammasome-associated caspases, the N-terminal domain of GSDMD forms membrane pores that promote cytolysis. Numerous proteins promote GSDMD cleavage, but none are known to be required for pore formation after GSDMD cleavage. Herein, we report a forward genetic screen that identified the Ragulator-Rag complex as being necessary for GSDMD pore formation and pyroptosis in macrophages. Mechanistic analysis revealed that Ragulator-Rag is not required for GSDMD cleavage upon inflammasome activation but rather promotes GSDMD oligomerization in the plasma membrane. Defects in GSDMD oligomerization and pore formation can be rescued by mitochondrial poisons that stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and ROS modulation impacts the ability of inflammasome pathways to promote pore formation downstream of GSDMD cleavage. These findings reveal an unexpected link between key regulators of immunity (inflammasome-GSDMD) and metabolism (Ragulator-Rag).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a core kinase of antiviral immunity, the activity and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is tightly controlled by multiple post-translational modifications. Although it has been demonstrated that TBK1 stability can be regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway, it is unclear whether another important protein degradation pathway, autophagosome pathway, can specifically affect TBK1 degradation by cargo receptors. Here we report that E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 functions as a negative regulator of type I interferon (IFN) signaling by targeting TBK1 for degradation at the late stage of viral infection, to prevent the host from excessive immune response. Mechanically NEDD4 catalyzes the K27-linked poly-ubiquitination of TBK1 at K344, which serves as a recognition signal for cargo receptor NDP52-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Taken together, our study reveals the regulatory role of NEDD4 in balancing TBK1-centered type I IFN activation and provides insights into the crosstalk between selective autophagy and antiviral signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification and Characterization of Robust Hepatocellular Carcinoma Prognostic Subtypes Based on an Integrative Metabolite-Protein Interaction Network</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolite-protein interactions (MPIs) play key roles in cancer metabolism. However, our current knowledge about MPIs in cancers remains limited due to the complexity of cancer cells. Herein, the authors construct an integrative MPI network and propose a MPI network based hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subtyping and mechanism exploration workflow. Based on the expressions of hub proteins on the MPI network, two prognosis-distinctive HCC subtypes are identified. Meanwhile, multiple interdependent features of the poor prognostic subtype are observed, including hypoxia, DNA hypermethylation of metabolic pathways, fatty acid accumulation, immune pathway up-regulation, and exhausted T-cell infiltration. Notably, the immune pathway up-regulation is probably induced by accumulated unsaturated fatty acids which are predicted to interact with multiple immune regulators like SRC and TGFB1. Moreover, based on tumor microenvironment compositions, the poor prognostic subtype is further divided into two sub-populations showing remarkable differences in metabolism. The subtyping shows a strong consistency across multiple HCC cohorts including early-stage HCC. Overall, the authors redefine robust HCC prognosis subtypes and identify potential MPIs linking metabolism to immune regulations, thus promoting understanding and clinical applications about HCC metabolism heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global crisis and is more devastating than any other previous infectious disease. It has affected a significant proportion of the global population both physically and mentally, and destroyed businesses and societies. Current evidence suggested that immunopathology may be responsible for COVID-19 pathogenesis, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, dysregulation of monocytes and macrophages, reduced or delayed type I interferon (IFN-I) response, antibody-dependent enhancement, and especially, cytokine storm (CS). The CS is characterized by hyperproduction of an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines and is closely associated with poor prognosis. These excessively secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines initiate different inflammatory signaling pathways via their receptors on immune and tissue cells, resulting in complicated medical symptoms including fever, capillary leak syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure, ultimately leading to death in the most severe cases. Therefore, it is clinically important to understand the initiation and signaling pathways of CS to develop more effective treatment strategies for COVID-19. Herein, we discuss the latest developments in the immunopathological characteristics of COVID-19 and focus on CS including the current research status of the different cytokines involved. We also discuss the induction, function, downstream signaling, and existing and potential interventions for targeting these cytokines or related signal pathways. We believe that a comprehensive understanding of CS in COVID-19 will help to develop better strategies to effectively control immunopathology in this disease and other infectious and inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interplay between EBV infection and acquired genetic alterations during nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) development remains vague. Here we report a comprehensive genomic analysis of 70 NPCs, combining whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of microdissected tumor cells with EBV oncogene expression to reveal multiple aspects of cellular-viral co-operation in tumorigenesis. Genomic aberrations along with EBV-encoded LMP1 expression underpin constitutive NF-κB activation in 90% of NPCs. A similar spectrum of somatic aberrations and viral gene expression undermine innate immunity in 79% of cases and adaptive immunity in 47% of cases; mechanisms by which NPC may evade immune surveillance despite its pro-inflammatory phenotype. Additionally, genomic changes impairing TGFBR2 promote oncogenesis and stabilize EBV infection in tumor cells. Fine-mapping of CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletion breakpoints reveals homozygous MTAP deletions in 32-34% of NPCs that confer marked sensitivity to MAT2A inhibition. Our work concludes that NPC is a homogeneously NF-κB-driven and immune-protected, yet potentially druggable, cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemokine receptor CCR5 plays a vital role in immune surveillance and inflammation. However, molecular details that govern its endogenous chemokine recognition and receptor activation remain elusive. Here we report three cryo-electron microscopy structures of G&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt; protein-coupled CCR5 in a ligand-free state and in complex with the chemokine MIP-1α or RANTES, as well as the crystal structure of MIP-1α-bound CCR5. These structures reveal distinct binding modes of the two chemokines and a specific accommodate pattern of the chemokine for the distal N terminus of CCR5. Together with functional data, the structures demonstrate that chemokine-induced rearrangement of toggle switch and plasticity of the receptor extracellular region are critical for receptor activation, while a conserved tryptophan residue in helix II acts as a trigger of receptor constitutive activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicle- and particle-mediated communication shapes innate and adaptive immune responses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercellular communication among immune cells is vital for the coordination of proper immune responses. Extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) act as messengers in intercellular communication, with important consequences for target cell and organ physiology in both health and disease. Under normal physiological conditions, immune cell-derived EVPs participate in immune responses by regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. EVPs play a major role in antigen presentation and immune activation. On the other hand, immune cell-derived EVPs exert immunosuppressive and regulatory effects. Consequently, EVPs may contribute to pathological conditions, such as autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, graft rejection, and cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we provide an overview of the role of EVPs in immune homeostasis and pathophysiology, with a particular focus on their contribution to innate and adaptive immunity and their potential use for immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Arginine monomethylation by PRMT7 controls MAVS-mediated antiviral innate immunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate control of innate immune responses is required to eliminate invading pathogens and simultaneously avoid autoinflammation and autoimmune diseases. Here, we demonstrate that arginine monomethylation precisely regulates the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated antiviral response. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) forms aggregates to catalyze MAVS monomethylation at arginine residue 52 (R52), attenuating its binding to TRIM31 and RIG-I, which leads to the suppression of MAVS aggregation and subsequent activation. Upon virus infection, aggregated PRMT7 is disabled in a timely manner due to automethylation at arginine residue 32 (R32), and SMURF1 is recruited to PRMT7 by MAVS to induce proteasomal degradation of PRMT7, resulting in the relief of PRMT7 suppression of MAVS activation. Therefore, we not only reveal that arginine monomethylation by PRMT7 negatively regulates MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling in vitro and in vivo but also uncover a mechanism by which PRMT7 is tightly controlled to ensure the timely activation of antiviral defense.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbiota plays a fundamental role in regulating host immunity. However, the processes involved in the initiation and regulation of immunity to the microbiota remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the skin microbiota promotes the discrete expression of defined endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Keratinocyte-intrinsic responses to ERVs depended on cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) signaling and promoted the induction of commensal-specific T cells. Inhibition of ERV reverse transcription significantly impacted these responses, resulting in impaired immunity to the microbiota and its associated tissue repair function. Conversely, a lipid-enriched diet primed the skin for heightened ERV- expression in response to commensal colonization, leading to increased immune responses and tissue inflammation. Together, our results support the idea that the host may have co-opted its endogenous virome as a means to communicate with the exogenous microbiota, resulting in a multi-kingdom dialog that controls both tissue homeostasis and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RNA-binding protein RBM47 stabilizes IFNAR1 mRNA to potentiate host antiviral activity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34160127/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-α/β)-mediated immune response is the first line of host defense against invading viruses. IFN-α/β binds to IFN-α/β receptors (IFNARs) and triggers the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Thus, stabilization of IFNARs is important for prolonging antiviral activity. Here, we report the induction of an RNA-binding motif-containing protein, RBM47, upon viral infection or interferon stimulation. Using multiple virus infection models, we demonstrate that RBM47 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. RBM47 has no noticeable impact on IFN production, but significantly activates the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and enhances the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Mechanistically, RBM47 binds to the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR of IFNAR1 mRNA, increases mRNA stability, and retards the degradation of IFNAR1. In summary, this study suggests that RBM47 is an interferon-inducible RNA-binding protein that plays an essential role in enhancing host IFN downstream signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA helicases play critical roles in various biological processes, including serving as viral RNA sensors in innate immunity. Here, we find that RNA helicase DEAH-box helicase 15 (DHX15) is essential for type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-β), type III IFN (IFN-λ3), and inflammasome-derived cytokine IL-18 production by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in response to poly I:C and RNA viruses with preference of enteric RNA viruses, but not DNA virus. Importantly, we generate IEC-specific Dhx15-knockout mice and demonstrate that DHX15 is required for controlling intestinal inflammation induced by enteric RNA virus rotavirus in suckling mice and reovirus in adult mice in vivo, which owes to impaired IFN-β, IFN-λ3, and IL-18 production in IECs from Dhx15-deficient mice. Mechanistically, DHX15 interacts with NLRP6 to trigger NLRP6 inflammasome assembly and activation for inducing IL-18 secretion in IECs. Collectively, our report reveals critical roles for DHX15 in sensing enteric RNA viruses in IECs and controlling intestinal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Direct activation of the proton channel by albumin leads to human sperm capacitation and sustained release of inflammatory mediators by neutrophils</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human voltage-gated proton channels (hHv1) extrude protons from cells to compensate for charge and osmotic imbalances due metabolism, normalizing intracellular pH and regulating protein function. Human albumin (Alb), present at various levels throughout the body, regulates oncotic pressure and transports ligands. Here, we report Alb is required to activate hHv1 in sperm and neutrophils. Dose-response studies reveal the concentration of Alb in semen is too low to activate hHv1 in sperm whereas the higher level in uterine fluid yields proton efflux, allowing capacitation, the acrosomal reaction, and oocyte fertilization. Likewise, Alb activation of hHv1 in neutrophils is required to sustain production and release of reactive oxygen species during the immune respiratory burst. One Alb binds to both voltage sensor domains (VSDs) in hHv1, enhancing open probability and increasing proton current. A computational model of the Alb-hHv1 complex, validated by experiments, identifies two sites in Alb domain II that interact with the VSDs, suggesting an electrostatic gating modification mechanism favoring the active &amp;ldquo;up&amp;rdquo; sensor conformation. This report shows how sperm are triggered to fertilize, resolving how hHv1 opens at negative membrane potentials in sperm, and describes a role for Alb in physiology that will operate in the many tissues expressing hHv1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular cytokines are enriched in the tumor microenvironment and regulate various important properties of cancers, including autophagy. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the link between autophagy and extracellular cytokines remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that IL-6 activates autophagy through the IL-6/JAK2/BECN1 pathway and promotes chemotherapy resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC). Mechanistically, IL-6 triggers the interaction between JAK2 and BECN1, where JAK2 phosphorylates BECN1 at Y333. We demonstrate that BECN1 Y333 phosphorylation is crucial for BECN1 activation and IL-6-induced autophagy by regulating PI3KC3 complex formation. Furthermore, we investigate BECN1 Y333 phosphorylation as a predictive marker for poor CRC prognosis and chemotherapy resistance. Combination treatment with autophagy inhibitors or pharmacological agents targeting the IL-6/JAK2/BECN1 signaling pathway may represent a potential strategy for CRC cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Early-Life Microbial Restitution Reduces Colitis Risk Promoted by Antibiotic-Induced Gut Dysbiosis in Interleukin 10-/- Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34111469/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Perturbations in the early-life gut microbiome are associated with increased risk for complex immune disorders like inflammatory bowel diseases. We previously showed that maternal antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis vertically transmitted to offspring increases experimental colitis risk in interleukin (IL) 10 gene deficient (IL10-/-) mice, a finding that may result from the loss/lack of essential microbes needed for appropriate immunologic education early in life. Here, we aimed to identify key microbes required for proper development of the early-life gut microbiome that decrease colitis risk in genetically susceptible animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Metagenomic sequencing followed by reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes was performed on fecal samples of IL10-/- mice with and without antibiotic-induced dysbiosis to identify potential missing microbial members needed for immunologic education. One high-value target strain was then engrafted early and/or late into the gut microbiomes of IL10-/- mice with antibiotic-induced dysbiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Early-, but not late-, life engraftment of a single dominant Bacteroides strain of non-antibiotic-treated IL10-/- mice was sufficient to restore the development of the gut microbiome, promote immune tolerance, and prevent colitis in IL10-/- mice that had antibiotic-induced dysbiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Restitution of a keystone microbial strain missing in the early-life antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis results in recovery of the microbiome, proper development of immune tolerance, and reduced risk for colitis in genetically prone hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An infectivity-enhancing site on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein targeted by antibodies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the effects of antibodies against other spike protein domains are largely unknown. Here, we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) induced the open conformation of RBD and thus enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2 and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis revealed that all of the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the NTD. Structural analysis demonstrated that all infectivity-enhancing antibodies bound to NTD in a similar manner. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected at high levels in severe patients. Moreover, we identified antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site in uninfected donors, albeit at a lower frequency. These findings demonstrate that not only neutralizing antibodies but also enhancing antibodies are produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>YAP promotes the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome via blocking K27-linked polyubiquitination of NLRP3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transcription coactivator YAP plays a vital role in Hippo pathway for organ-size control and tissue homeostasis. Recent studies have demonstrated YAP is closely related to immune disorders and inflammatory diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain less defined. Here, we find that YAP promotes the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, an intracellular multi-protein complex that orchestrates host immune responses to infections or sterile injuries. YAP deficiency in myeloid cells significantly attenuates LPS-induced systemic inflammation and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals-induced peritonitis. Mechanistically, YAP physically interacts with NLRP3 and maintains the stability of NLRP3 through blocking the association between NLRP3 and the E3 ligase β-TrCP1, the latter increases the proteasomal degradation of NLRP3 via K27-linked ubiquitination at lys380. Together, these findings establish a role of YAP in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, and provide potential therapeutic target to treat the NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Channelling inflammation: gasdermins in physiology and disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasdermins were recently identified as the mediators of pyroptosis - inflammatory cell death triggered by cytosolic sensing of invasive infection and danger signals. Upon activation, gasdermins form cell membrane pores, which release pro-inflammatory cytokines and alarmins and damage the integrity of the cell membrane. Roles for gasdermins in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, deafness and cancer are emerging, revealing potential novel therapeutic avenues. Here, we review current knowledge of the family of gasdermins, focusing on their mechanisms of action and roles in normal physiology and disease. Efforts to develop drugs to modulate gasdermin activity to reduce inflammation or activate more potent immune responses are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cancer-derived exosomal miR-138-5p modulates polarization of tumor-associated macrophages through inhibition of KDM6B</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34093857/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34093857/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Differential activation of macrophages correlates closely with tumor progression, and the epigenetic factor lysine demethylase 6B (KDM6B, previously named JMJD3) mediates the regulation of macrophage polarization through an unknown mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We developed a suspension coculture system comprising breast cancer cells and macrophages and used RT-qPCR and western blotting to measure &lt;em&gt;KDM6B&lt;/em&gt; expression. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays were used to identify candidate microRNAs of cancer cells responsible for the downregulation of KDM6B. To determine if exosomes mediated the transfer of miR-138-5p between cancer cells to macrophages, we treated macrophages with exosomes collected from the conditioned medium of cancer cells. The effects of exosomal miR-138-5p on macrophage polarization were measured using RT-qPCR, flow cytometry, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We employed a mouse model of breast cancer, metastatic to the lung, to evaluate the effects on tumor metastasis of macrophages treated with miR-138-5p-enriched exosomes. To develop a diagnostic evaluation index, the levels of exosomal miR-138-5p in samples from patients with breast cancer were compared to those of controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Coculture of breast cancer cells led to downregulation of &lt;em&gt;KDM6B&lt;/em&gt; expression in macrophages. Cancer cell-derived exosomal miR-138-5p inhibited M1 polarization and promoted M2 polarization through inhibition of &lt;em&gt;KDM6B&lt;/em&gt; expression in macrophages. Macrophages treated with exosomal miR-138-5p promoted lung metastasis, and the level of circulating exosomal miR-138-5p positively correlated with the progression of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our data suggest that miR-138-5p was delivered from breast cancer cells to tumor-associated macrophages via exosomes to downregulate &lt;em&gt;KDM6B&lt;/em&gt; expression, inhibit M1 polarization, and stimulate M2 polarization. Therefore, exosomal miR-138-5p represents a promising prognostic marker and target for the treatment of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblasts as immune regulators in infection, inflammation and cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chronic infection, inflammation and cancer, the tissue microenvironment controls how local immune cells behave, with tissue-resident fibroblasts emerging as a key cell type in regulating activation or suppression of an immune response. Fibroblasts are heterogeneous cells, encompassing functionally distinct populations, the phenotypes of which differ according to their tissue of origin and type of inciting disease. Their immunological properties are also diverse, ranging from the maintenance of a potent inflammatory environment in chronic inflammation to promoting immunosuppression in malignancy, and encapsulating and incarcerating infectious agents within tissues. In this Review, we compare the mechanisms by which fibroblasts control local immune responses, as well as the factors regulating their inflammatory and suppressive profiles, in different tissues and pathological settings. This cross-disease perspective highlights the importance of tissue context in determining fibroblast-immune cell interactions, as well as potential therapeutic avenues to exploit this knowledge for the benefit of patients with chronic infection, inflammation and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gasdermin E permits interleukin-1 beta release in distinct sublytic and pyroptotic phases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflammasome activation in the absence of gasdermin D activates gasdermin E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gasdermin E permits IL-1β release independent of cell death in a sublytic phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lysis depends on substantial gasdermin E oligomerization and pore formation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellular inflammasome activation causes caspase-1 cleavage of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) with subsequent pyroptotic cell death and cytokine release. Here, we clarify the ambiguous role of the related family member gasdermin E (GSDME) in this process. Inflammasome stimulation in GSDMD-deficient cells led to apoptotic caspase cleavage of GSDME. Endogenous GSDME activation permitted sublytic, continuous interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release and membrane leakage, even in GSDMD-sufficient cells, whereas ectopic expression led to pyroptosis with GSDME oligomerization and complete liberation of IL-1β akin to GSDMD pyroptosis. We find that NLRP3 and NLRP1 inflammasomes ultimately rely concurrently on both gasdermins for IL-1β processing and release separately from their ability to induce cell lysis. Our study thus identifies GSDME as a conduit for IL-1β release independent of its ability to cause cell death.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but efficacy remains limited in most clinical settings. Cancer is a systemic disease that induces many functional and compositional changes to the immune system as a whole. Immunity is regulated by interactions of diverse cell lineages across tissues. Therefore, an improved understanding of tumour immunology must assess the systemic immune landscape beyond the tumour microenvironment (TME). Importantly, the peripheral immune system is required to drive effective natural and therapeutically induced antitumour immune responses. In fact, emerging evidence suggests that immunotherapy drives new immune responses rather than the reinvigoration of pre-existing immune responses. However, new immune responses in individuals burdened with tumours are compromised even beyond the TME. Herein, we aim to comprehensively outline the current knowledge of systemic immunity in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The cGAS-STING pathway as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/33833439/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cGAS-STING signalling pathway has emerged as a key mediator of inflammation in the settings of infection, cellular stress and tissue damage. Underlying this broad involvement of the cGAS-STING pathway is its capacity to sense and regulate the cellular response towards microbial and host-derived DNAs, which serve as ubiquitous danger-associated molecules. Insights into the structural and molecular biology of the cGAS-STING pathway have enabled the development of selective small-molecule inhibitors with the potential to target the cGAS-STING axis in a number of inflammatory diseases in humans. Here, we outline the principal elements of the cGAS-STING signalling cascade and discuss the general mechanisms underlying the association of cGAS-STING activity with various autoinflammatory, autoimmune and degenerative diseases. Finally, we outline the chemical nature of recently developed cGAS and STING antagonists and summarize their potential clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Serine metabolism antagonizes antiviral innate immunity by preventing ATP6V0d2-mediated YAP lysosomal degradation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serine metabolism promotes tumor oncogenesis and regulates immune cell functions, but whether it also contributes to antiviral innate immunity is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that virus-infected macrophages display decreased expression of serine synthesis pathway (SSP) enzymes. Suppressing the SSP key enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) by genetic approaches or by treatment with the pharmaceutical inhibitor CBR-5884 and by exogenous serine restriction enhanced IFN-β-mediated antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic experiments showed that virus infection or serine metabolism deficiency increased the expression of the V-ATPase subunit ATP6V0d2 by inhibiting S-adenosyl methionine-dependent H3K27me3 occupancy at the promoter. ATP6V0d2 promoted YAP lysosomal degradation to relieve YAP-mediated blockade of the TBK1-IRF3 axis and, thus, enhance IFN-β production. These findings implicate critical functions of PHGDH and the key immunometabolite serine in blunting antiviral innate immunity and also suggest manipulation of serine metabolism as a therapeutic strategy against virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently affecting millions of lives worldwide. Large retrospective studies indicate that an elevated level of inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors are associated with both increased disease severity and mortality. Here, using multidimensional epigenetic, transcriptional, &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; analyses, we report that topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibition suppresses lethal inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic treatment with two doses of topotecan (TPT), an FDA-approved TOP1 inhibitor, suppresses infection-induced inflammation in hamsters. TPT treatment as late as 4 days post-infection reduces morbidity and rescues mortality in a transgenic mouse model. These results support the potential of TOP1 inhibition as an effective host-directed therapy against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. TPT and its derivatives are inexpensive clinical-grade inhibitors available in most countries. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of repurposing TOP1 inhibitors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The subcellular redistribution of NLRC5 promotes angiogenesis via interacting with STAT3 in endothelial cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33754073/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angiogenesis is a critical step in repair of tissue injury. The pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) during injury and achieve host defense directly. However, the role of NLR family CARD domain containing 5 (NLRC5), an important member of PPRs, beyond host defense in angiogenesis during tissue repair remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, western blot and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were used to detect the expression of NLRC5 in endothelial cells (ECs). Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to reveal the subcellular location of NLRC5 in ECs. Cell proliferation, wound healing, tube formation assays of ECs were performed to study the role of NLRC5 in angiogenesis. By using Tie2Cre-NLRC5&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt; mice and bone marrow transplantation studies, we defined an EC-specific role for NLRC5 in angiogenesis. Mechanistically, co-immunoprecipitation studies and RNA sequencing indicated that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was the target of NLRC5 in the nucleus. And Co-IP was used to verify the specific domain of NLRC5 binding with STAT3. ChIP assay determined the genes regulated by interaction of STAT3 and NLRC5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knockdown of NLRC5 in vitro or in vivo inhibited pathological angiogenesis, but had no effect on physiological angiogenesis. NLRC5 was also identified to bind to STAT3 in the nucleus required the integrated death-domain and nucleotide-binding domain (DD+NACHT domain) of NLRC5. And the interaction of STAT3 and NLRC5 could enhance the transcription of angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) to participate in angiogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ischemic microenvironment, NLRC5 protein accumulates in the nucleus of ECs and enhances STAT3 transcriptional activity for angiogenesis. These findings establish NLRC5 as a novel modulator of VEGFA signaling, providing a new target for angiogenic therapy to foster tissue&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of NLRC4 promotes inflammasome activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33664876/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;S. typhimurium&lt;/em&gt;) infection of macrophage induces NLRC4 inflammasome-mediated production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β. Post-translational modifications on NLRC4 are critical for its activation. Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) is the most thoroughly studied mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) -dependent deacetylase. We wondered whether SIRT3 mediated-deacetylation could take part in NLRC4 inflammasome activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; We initially tested IL-1β production and pyroptosis after cytosolic transfection of flagellin or &lt;em&gt;S. typhimurium&lt;/em&gt; infection in wild type and SIRT3-deficient primary peritoneal macrophages via immunoblotting and ELISA assay. These results were confirmed in SIRT3-deficient immortalized bone marrow derived macrophages (iBMDMs) which were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology. In addition, in vivo experiments were conducted to confirm the role of SIRT3 in &lt;em&gt;S. typhimurium&lt;/em&gt;-induced cytokines production. Then NLRC4 assembly was analyzed by immune-fluorescence assay and ASC oligomerization assay. Immunoblotting, ELISA and flow cytometry were performed to clarify the role of SIRT3 in NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes activation. To further investigate the mechanism of SIRT3 in NLRC4 activation, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), we did immunoblot, cellular fractionation and in-vitro deacetylation assay. Finally, to clarify the acetylation sites of NLRC4, we performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and immunoblotting analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; SIRT3 deficiency led to significantly impaired NLRC4 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Furthermore, SIRT3 promotes NLRC4 inflammasome assembly by inducing more ASC speck formation and ASC oligomerization. However, SIRT3 is dispensable for NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome activation. Moreover, SIRT3 interacts with and deacetylates NLRC4 to promote its activation. Finally, we proved that deacetylation of NLRC4 at Lys71 or Lys272 could promote its activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Our study reveals that SIRT3 mediated-deacetylation of NLRC4 is pivotal for NLRC4 activation and the acetylation switch of NLRC4 may aid the clearance of &lt;em&gt;S. typhimurium&lt;/em&gt; infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heparin prevents caspase-11-dependent septic lethality independent of anticoagulant properties</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33561388/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heparin, a mammalian polysaccharide, is a widely used anticoagulant medicine to treat thrombotic disorders. It is also known to improve outcomes in sepsis, a leading cause of mortality resulted from infection-induced immune dysfunction. Whereas it is relatively clear how heparin exerts its anticoagulant effect, the immunomodulatory mechanisms enabled by heparin remain enigmatic. Here, we show that heparin prevented caspase-11-dependent immune responses and lethality in sepsis independent of its anticoagulant properties. Heparin or a chemically modified form of heparin without anticoagulant function inhibited the alarmin HMGB1-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interaction and prevented the macrophage glycocalyx degradation by heparanase. These events blocked the cytosolic delivery of LPS in macrophages and the activation of caspase-11, a cytosolic LPS receptor that mediates lethality in sepsis. Survival was higher in septic patients treated with heparin than those without heparin treatment. The identification of this previously unrecognized heparin function establishes a link between innate immune responses and coagulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UFMylation inhibits the proinflammatory capacity of interferon-γ-activated macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33372156/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophages activated with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in combination with other proinflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), respond with transcriptional and cellular changes that enhance clearance of intracellular pathogens at the risk of damaging tissues. IFN-γ effects must therefore be carefully balanced with inhibitory mechanisms to prevent immunopathology. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in a macrophage cell line to identify negative regulators of IFN-γ responses. We discovered an unexpected role of the ubiquitin-fold modifier (Ufm1) conjugation system (herein UFMylation) in inhibiting responses to IFN-γ and lipopolysaccharide. Enhanced IFN-γ activation in UFMylation-deficient cells resulted in increased transcriptional responses to IFN-γ in a manner dependent on endoplasmic reticulum stress responses involving Ern1 and Xbp1. Furthermore, UFMylation in myeloid cells is required for resistance to influenza infection in mice, indicating that this pathway modulates in vivo responses to infection. These findings provide a genetic roadmap for the regulation of responses to a key mediator of cellular immunity and identify a molecular link between the UFMylation pathway and immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intracellular immune sensing promotes inflammation via gasdermin D-driven release of a lectin alarmin</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33398185/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory caspase sensing of cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers pyroptosis and the concurrent release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Collectively, DAMPs are key determinants that shape the aftermath of inflammatory cell death. However, the identity and function of the individual DAMPs released are poorly defined. Our proteomics study revealed that cytosolic LPS sensing triggered the release of galectin-1, a β-galactoside-binding lectin. Galectin-1 release is a common feature of inflammatory cell death, including necroptosis. In vivo studies using galectin-1-deficient mice, recombinant galectin-1 and galectin-1-neutralizing antibody showed that galectin-1 promotes inflammation and plays a detrimental role in LPS-induced lethality. Mechanistically, galectin-1 inhibition of CD45 (&lt;em&gt;Ptprc&lt;/em&gt;) underlies its unfavorable role in endotoxin shock. Finally, we found increased galectin-1 in sera from human patients with sepsis. Overall, we uncovered galectin-1 as a bona fide DAMP released as a consequence of cytosolic LPS sensing, identifying a new outcome of inflammatory cell death.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decreased Expression of the Host Long-Noncoding RNA-GM Facilitates Viral Escape by Inhibiting the Kinase activity TBK1 via S-glutathionylation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade elimination by the immune system. Here we examined the contribution of host long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in viral immune evasion. By functional screening of lncRNAs whose expression decreased upon viral infection of macrophages, we identified a lncRNA (lncRNA-GM, Gene Symbol: AK189470.1) that promoted type I interferon (IFN-I) production and inhibited viral replication. Deficiency of lncRNA-GM in mice increased susceptibility to viral infection and impaired IFN-I production. Mechanistically, lncRNA-GM bound to glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and blocked GSTM1 interaction with the kinase TBK1, reducing GSTM1-mediated S-glutathionylation of TBK1. Decreased S-glutathionylation enhanced TBK1 activity and downstream production of antiviral mediators. Viral infection reprogrammed intracellular glutathione metabolism and furthermore, an oxidized glutathione mimetic could inhibit TBK1 activity and promote viral replication. Our findings reveal regulation of TBK1 by S-glutathionylation and provide insight into the viral mediated metabolic changes that impact innate immunity and viral evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heat Shock Factor 1-dependent extracellular matrix remodeling mediates the transition from chronic intestinal inflammation to colon cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the colon, long-term exposure to chronic inflammation drives colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. While the causal and clinical links are well established, molecular understanding of how chronic inflammation leads to the development of colon cancer is lacking. Here we deconstruct the evolving microenvironment of CAC by measuring proteomic changes and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization over time in a mouse model of CAC. We detect early changes in ECM structure and composition, and report a crucial role for the transcriptional regulator heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in orchestrating these events. Loss of HSF1 abrogates ECM assembly by colon fibroblasts in cell-culture, prevents inflammation-induced ECM remodeling in mice and inhibits progression to CAC. Establishing relevance to human disease, we find high activation of stromal HSF1 in CAC patients, and detect the HSF1-dependent proteomic ECM signature in human colorectal cancer. Thus, HSF1-dependent ECM remodeling plays a crucial role in mediating inflammation-driven colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commensal microbiota has been implicated in the regulation of a diverse array of physiological processes, both within the gastrointestinal tract and at distant tissue sites. Cancer is no exception, and distinct aspects of the microbiota have been reported to have either pro- or anti-tumor effects. The functional role of the microbiota in regulating not only mucosal but also systemic immune responses has led to investigations into the impact on cancer immunotherapies, particularly with agents targeting the immunologic checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4. Microbial sequencing and reconstitution of germ-free mice have indicated both positive and negative regulatory bacteria likely exist, which either promote or interfere with immunotherapy efficacy. These collective findings have led to the development of clinical trials pursuing microbiome-based therapeutic interventions, with the hope of expanding immunotherapy efficacy. This review summarizes recent knowledge about the relationship between the host microbiota and cancer and anti-tumor immune response, with implications for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TLR signaling adapter BCAP regulates inflammatory to reparatory macrophage transition by promoting histone lactylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33199625/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophages respond to microbial ligands and various noxious cues by initiating an inflammatory response aimed at eliminating the original pathogenic insult. Transition of macrophages from a proinflammatory state to a reparative state, however, is vital for resolution of inflammation and return to homeostasis. The molecular players governing this transition remain poorly defined. Here, we find that the reparative macrophage transition is dictated by B-cell adapter for PI3K (BCAP). Mice harboring a macrophage-specific deletion of BCAP fail to recover from and succumb to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis due to prolonged intestinal inflammation and impaired tissue repair. Following microbial stimulation, gene expression in WT macrophages switches from an early inflammatory signature to a late reparative signature, a process that is hampered in BCAP-deficient macrophages. We find that absence of BCAP hinders inactivation of FOXO1 and GSK3β, which contributes to their enhanced inflammatory state. BCAP deficiency also results in defective aerobic glycolysis and reduced lactate production. This translates into reduced histone lactylation and decreased expression of reparative macrophage genes. Thus, our results reveal BCAP to be a critical cell-intrinsic switch that regulates transition of inflammatory macrophages to reparative macrophages by imprinting epigenetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophages initiate inflammation to eliminate invading microbes. Following clearance of inflammatory stimuli, macrophages down-regulate inflammatory genes and express repair genes to protect host tissues from damage. Here, we find that the adaptor B-cell adapter for PI3K (BCAP) facilitates this transition of inflammatory macrophages to reparative macrophages. Absence of BCAP in macrophages limits the ability of mice to repair intestinal tissues following inflammatory damage. Following Toll-like receptor stimulation, macrophages undergo aerobic glycolysis that results in lactate production, a process compromised in BCAP-deficient macrophages. This lactate is incorporated into histone tails and is involved in reparative macrophage transition. We find defective lactate production by BCAP-deficient macrophages results in reduced histone lactylation and expression of tissue repair genes, thus blunting their reparative transition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide with limited medications and neuroinflammation was recognized as a critical player in the progression of stroke, but how to control the overactive neuroinflammation is still a long-standing challenge. Here, we designed a novel SIRT6 activator MDL-811 which remarkably inhibited inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and primary mouse microglia, which were abolished by silencing SIRT6. RNA-seq screening identified the forkhead box C1 (Foxc1) is a key gene evoked by MDL-811 stimulation and is required for the anti-inflammatory effects of MDL-811. We found MDL-811-activated SIRT6 directly interacted with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and promoted deacetylation of EZH2 which could bind to the promoter of Foxc1 and upregulate its expression to modulate inflammation. Moreover, our data demonstrated that MDL-811 not only ameliorated sickness behaviors in neuroinflammatory mice induced by LPS, but also markedly reduced the brain injury in ischemic stroke mice in addition to promoting long-term functional recovery. Importantly, MDL-811 also exhibited strong anti-inflammatory effects in human monocytes isolated from ischemic stroke patients, underlying an interesting translational perspective. Taken together, MDL-811 could be an alternative therapeutic candidate for ischemic stroke and other brain disorders associated with neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Complement and tissue factor-enriched neutrophil extracellular traps are key drivers in COVID-19 immunothrombosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging data indicate that complement and neutrophils contribute to the maladaptive immune response that fuels hyperinflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy, thereby increasing coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) mortality. Here, we investigated how complement interacts with the platelet/neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)/thrombin axis, using COVID-19 specimens, cell-based inhibition studies, and NET/human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) cocultures. Increased plasma levels of NETs, tissue factor (TF) activity, and sC5b-9 were detected in patients. Neutrophils of patients yielded high TF expression and released NETs carrying active TF. Treatment of control neutrophils with COVID-19 platelet-rich plasma generated TF-bearing NETs that induced thrombotic activity of HAECs. Thrombin or NETosis inhibition or C5aR1 blockade attenuated platelet-mediated NET-driven thrombogenicity. COVID-19 serum induced complement activation in vitro, consistent with high complement activity in clinical samples. Complement C3 inhibition with compstatin Cp40 disrupted TF expression in neutrophils. In conclusion, we provide a mechanistic basis for a pivotal role of complement and NETs in COVID-19 immunothrombosis. This study supports strategies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that exploit complement or NETosis inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USP19 suppresses inflammation and promotes M2-like macrophage polarization by manipulating NLRP3 function via autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33097834/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophage polarization to proinflammatory M1-like or anti-inflammatory M2-like cells is critical to mount a host defense or repair tissue. The exact molecular mechanisms controlling this process are still elusive. Here, we report that ubiquitin-specific protease 19 (USP19) acts as an anti-inflammatory switch that inhibits inflammatory responses and promotes M2-like macrophage polarization. USP19 inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation by increasing autophagy flux and decreasing the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. In addition, USP19 inhibited the proteasomal degradation of inflammasome-independent NLRP3 by cleaving its polyubiquitin chains. USP19-stabilized NLRP3 promoted M2-like macrophage polarization by direct association with interferon regulatory factor 4, thereby preventing its p62-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Consistent with these observations, compared to wild-type mice, Usp19-/- mice had decreased M2-like macrophage polarization and increased interleukin-1β secretion, in response to alum and chitin injections. Thus, we have uncovered an unexpected mechanism by which USP19 switches the proinflammatory function of NLRP3 into an anti-inflammatory function, and suggest that USP19 is a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The function and regulation of TET2 in innate immunity and inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/33085059/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TET2, a member of ten-eleven translocation (TET) family as α-ketoglutarate- and Fe2+-dependent dioxygenase catalyzing the iterative oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), has been widely recognized to be an important regulator for normal hematopoiesis especially myelopoiesis. Mutation and dysregulation of TET2 contribute to the development of multiple hematological malignancies. Recent studies reveal that TET2 also plays an important role in innate immune homeostasis by promoting DNA demethylation or independent of its enzymatic activity. Here, we focus on the functions of TET2 in the initiation and resolution of inflammation through epigenetic regulation and signaling network. In addition, we highlight regulation of TET2 at various molecular levels as well as the correlated inflammatory diseases, which will provide the insight to intervene in the pathological process caused by TET2 dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A STAT3 palmitoylation cycle promotes TH17 differentiation and colitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33029007/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cysteine palmitoylation (S-palmitoylation) is a reversible post-translational modification that is installed by the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases and is reversed by several acyl protein thioesterases. Although thousands of human proteins are known to undergo S-palmitoylation, how this modification is regulated to modulate specific biological functions is poorly understood. Here we report that the key T helper 17 (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17) cell differentiation stimulator, STAT3, is subject to reversible S-palmitoylation on cysteine 108. DHHC7 palmitoylates STAT3 and promotes its membrane recruitment and phosphorylation. Acyl protein thioesterase 2 (APT2, also known as LYPLA2) depalmitoylates phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and enables it to translocate to the nucleus. This palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle enhances STAT3 activation and promotes T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cell differentiation; perturbation of either palmitoylation or depalmitoylation negatively affects T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cell differentiation. Overactivation of T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells is associated with several inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a mouse model, pharmacological inhibition of APT2 or knockout of Zdhhc7-which encodes DHHC7-relieves the symptoms of IBD. Our study reveals not only a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBD but also a model through which S-palmitoylation regulates cell signalling, which might be broadly applicable for understanding the signalling functions of numerous S-palmitoylation events.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal stem cells alleviate LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the proinflammatory function of Ly6C&#43; CD8&#43; T cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33024074/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systemic inflammatory processes, including alveolar injury, cytokine induction, and neutrophil accumulation, play key roles in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury (ALI). The immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can contribute to the treatment of inflammatory disorders. In previous studies, the focus was on innate immune cells and the effects of MSCs on ALI through CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells remain unclear. In the present study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce ALI in mice. ALI mice were treated with MSCs via intratracheal instillation. Survival rate, histopathological changes, protein levels, total cell count, cytokine levels, and chemokine levels in alveolar lavage fluid were used to determine the efficacy of MSCs. Mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were used to characterize the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the lungs. Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are prevalent in normal mice, whereas a specialized effector phenotype expressing a high level of Ly6C is predominant in advanced disease. MSCs significantly mitigated ALI and improved survival. MSCs decreased the infiltration of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, especially Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells into the lungs. Mass cytometry revealed that CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells expressing high Ly6C and CXCR3 levels caused tissue damage in the lungs of ALI mice, which was alleviated by MSCs. The scRNA-seq showed that Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells exhibited a more activated phenotype and decreased expression of proinflammatory factors that were enriched the most in immune chemotaxis after treatment with MSCs. We showed that CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells play an important role in MSC-mediated ALI remission, and both infiltration quantity and proinflammatory function were inhibited by MSCs, indicating a potential mechanism for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TREML4 receptor regulates inflammation and innate immune cell death during polymicrobial sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33020659/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a biphasic disease characterized by an acute inflammatory response, followed by a prolonged immunosuppressive phase. Therapies aimed at controlling inflammation help to reduce the time patients with sepsis spend in intensive care units, but they do not lead to a reduction in overall mortality. Recently, the focus has been on addressing the immunosuppressive phase, often caused by apoptosis of immune cells. However, molecular triggers of these events are not yet known. Using whole-genome CRISPR screening in mice, we identified a triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) family receptor, TREML4, as a key regulator of inflammation and immune cell death in sepsis. Genetic ablation of Treml4 in mice demonstrated that TREML4 regulates calcium homeostasis, the inflammatory cytokine response, myeloperoxidase activation, the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and apoptotic cell death in innate immune cells, leading to an overall increase in survival rate, both during the acute and chronic phases of polymicrobial sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immunosuppressive effects of mesenchymal stem cells on lung B cell gene expression in LPS-induced acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Immune system disorders play important roles in acute lung injury (ALI), and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment can reduce inflammation during ALI. In this study, we compared the changes in lung B cells during MSC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the effects of MSCs on lung B cells in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. MSCs were administered intratracheally 4 h after LPS. As vehicle-treated controls, mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% C57BL/6 (PBS group). Histopathological changes, survival rate, inflammatory factor levels, and the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis was performed to evaluate the transcriptional changes in lung B cells between the PBS, LPS, and LPS/MSC groups on days 3 and 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MSC treatment ameliorated LPS-induced ALI, as indicated by the reductions in mortality, the levels of chemokines and cytokines in BALF, and the severity of lung tissue histopathology in ALI mice. Lung B cells in the PBS group remained undifferentiated and had an inhibitory phenotype. Based on our scRNA-Seq results, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lung B cells in both the PBS group and LPS group were involved in chemotaxis processes and some proinflammatory pathways. MSC treatment inhibited the expression of chemokine genes that were upregulated by LPS and were related to the recruitment of neutrophils into lung tissues. Immunoglobulin-related gene expression was decreased in lung B cells of mice treated with LPS/MSC for 7 days. The DEGs regulated by MSCs were enriched in biological processes, including humoral immune response and apoptotic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Lung B cells played an important role in the effects of treatment of ALI with MSCs. These observations provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of MSC treatment for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HDAC6 mediates an aggresome-like mechanism for NLRP3 and pyrin inflammasome activation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that play key roles in immune surveillance. This is accomplished by the activation of inflammatory caspases, which leads to the proteolytic maturation of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and pyroptosis. Here, we show that nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)- and pyrin-mediated inflammasome assembly, caspase activation, and IL-1β conversion occur at the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). Furthermore, the dynein adapter histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is indispensable for the microtubule transport and assembly of these inflammasomes both in vitro and in mice. Because HDAC6 can transport ubiquitinated pathological aggregates to the MTOC for aggresome formation and autophagosomal degradation, its role in NLRP3 and pyrin inflammasome activation also provides an inherent mechanism for the down-regulation of these inflammasomes by autophagy. This work suggests an unexpected parallel between the formation of physiological and pathological aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Excessive deubiquitination of NLRP3-R779C variant contributes to very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease development</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32941940/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract occurring during infancy or early childhood. NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has emerged as a crucial regulator of intestinal homeostasis; however, whether NLRP3 variants may modify VEOIBD risk is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sought to investigate whether and how a rare NLRP3 variant, found in 3 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, contributes to VEOIBD development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were performed to screen disease-associated NLRP3 variants from a cohort of children with VEOIBD. Inflammasome activation was determined in reconstituted HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells with NLRP3 inflammasome components, doxycycline-inducible NLRP3 macrophages, as well as PBMCs and biopsies from patients with NLRP3 variants. Pathogenesis of the variants was determined using a dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute colitis model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a dominant gain-of-function missense variant of NLRP3, encoded by rs772009059 (R779C), in 3 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Functional analysis revealed that R779C increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in macrophages. This was mediated by enhanced deubiquitination of NLRP3 via binding with deubiquitinases BRCC3 and JOSD2, which are highly expressed in myeloid cells. In a dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute colitis model, NLRP3-R779C in hematopoietic cells resulted in more severe colitis, which can be ameliorated via knockdown of BRCC3 or JOSD2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRCC3 and JOSD2 mediate NLRP3-R779C deubiquitination, which promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the risk of developing VEOIBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lactate modulation of immune responses in inflammatory versus tumour microenvironments</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microenvironment in cancerous tissues is immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic, whereas the microenvironment of tissues affected by chronic inflammatory disease is pro-inflammatory and anti-resolution. Despite these opposing immunological states, the metabolic states in the tissue microenvironments of cancer and inflammatory diseases are similar: both are hypoxic, show elevated levels of lactate and other metabolic by-products and have low levels of nutrients. In this Review, we describe how the bioavailability of lactate differs in the microenvironments of tumours and inflammatory diseases compared with normal tissues, thus contributing to the establishment of specific immunological states in disease. A clear understanding of the metabolic signature of tumours and inflammatory diseases will enable therapeutic intervention aimed at resetting the bioavailability of metabolites and correcting the dysregulated immunological state, triggering beneficial cytotoxic, inflammatory responses in tumours and immunosuppressive responses in chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-1 induces mitochondrial translocation of IRAK2 to suppress oxidative metabolism in adipocytes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is a common feature of obesity, with elevated cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the circulation and tissues. Here, we report an unconventional IL-1R–MyD88–IRAK2–PHB/OPA1 signaling axis that reprograms mitochondrial metabolism in adipocytes to exacerbate obesity. IL-1 induced recruitment of IRAK2 Myddosome to mitochondria outer membranes via recognition by TOM20, followed by TIMM50-guided translocation of IRAK2 into mitochondria inner membranes, to suppress oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, thereby attenuating energy expenditure. Adipocyte-specific MyD88 or IRAK2 deficiency reduced high-fat-diet-induced weight gain, increased energy expenditure and ameliorated insulin resistance, associated with a smaller adipocyte size and increased cristae formation. IRAK2 kinase inactivation also reduced high-fat diet-induced metabolic diseases. Mechanistically, IRAK2 suppressed respiratory super-complex formation via interaction with PHB1 and OPA1 upon stimulation of IL-1. Taken together, our results suggest that the IRAK2 Myddosome functions as a critical link between inflammation and metabolism, representing a novel therapeutic target for patients with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inflammatory Signals Induce AT2 Cell-Derived Damage-Associated Transient Progenitors that Mediate Alveolar Regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32750316/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue regeneration is a multi-step process mediated by diverse cellular hierarchies and states that are also implicated in tissue dysfunction and pathogenesis. Here we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing in combination with in vivo lineage tracing and organoid models to finely map the trajectories of alveolar-lineage cells during injury repair and lung regeneration. We identified a distinct AT2-lineage population, damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs), that arises during alveolar regeneration. We found that interstitial macrophage-derived IL-1β primes a subset of AT2 cells expressing Il1r1 for conversion into DATPs via a HIF1α-mediated glycolysis pathway, which is required for mature AT1 cell differentiation. Importantly, chronic inflammation mediated by IL-1β prevents AT1 differentiation, leading to aberrant accumulation of DATPs and impaired alveolar regeneration. Together, this stepwise mapping to cell fate transitions shows how an inflammatory niche controls alveolar regeneration by controlling stem cell fate and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TRIM24 facilitates antiviral immunity through mediating K63-linked TRAF3 ubiquitination</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32324863/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitination is an essential mechanism in the control of antiviral immunity upon virus infection. Here, we identify a series of ubiquitination-modulating enzymes that are modulated by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Notably, TRIM24 is down-regulated through direct transcriptional suppression induced by VSV-activated IRF3. Reducing or ablating TRIM24 compromises type I IFN (IFN-I) induction upon RNA virus infection and thus renders mice more sensitive to VSV infection. Mechanistically, VSV infection induces abundant TRIM24 translocation to mitochondria, where TRIM24 binds with TRAF3 and directly mediates K63-linked TRAF3 ubiquitination at K429/K436. This modification of TRAF3 enables its association with MAVS and TBK1, which consequently activates downstream antiviral signaling. Together, these findings establish TRIM24 as a critical positive regulator in controlling the activation of antiviral signaling and describe a previously unknown mechanism of TRIM24 function.The predicted 80 open reading frames (ORFs) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) have been intensively studied for decades. Here, we unravel the complete viral transcriptome and translatome during lytic infection with base-pair resolution by computational integration of multi-omics data. We identify a total of 201 transcripts and 284 ORFs including all known and 46 novel large ORFs. This includes a so far unknown ORF in the locus deleted in the FDA-approved oncolytic virus Imlygic. Multiple transcript isoforms expressed from individual gene loci explain translation of the vast majority of ORFs as well as N-terminal extensions (NTEs) and truncations. We show that NTEs with non-canonical start codons govern the subcellular protein localization and packaging of key viral regulators and structural proteins. We extend the current nomenclature to include all viral gene products and provide a genome browser that visualizes all the obtained data from whole genome to single-nucleotide resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decreased Hepatocyte Autophagy Leads to Synergistic IL-1β and TNF Mouse Liver Injury and Inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32108953/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/32108953/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β has been implicated in the pathophysiology of nonalcoholic and alcoholic steatohepatitis. How IL-1β promotes liver injury in these diseases is unclear, as no IL-1β receptor-linked death pathway has been identified. Autophagy functions in hepatocyte resistance to injury and death, and findings of decreased hepatic autophagy in many liver diseases suggest a role for impaired autophagy in disease pathogenesis. Recent findings that autophagy blocks mouse liver injury from lipopolysaccharide led to an examination of autophagy&amp;rsquo;s function in hepatotoxicity from proinflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt; AML12 cells with decreased autophagy from a lentiviral autophagy-related 5 (Atg5) knockdown were resistant to toxicity from TNF, but sensitized to death from IL-1β, which was markedly amplified by TNF co-treatment. IL-1β/TNF death was necrosis by trypan blue and propidium iodide positivity, absence of mitochondrial death pathway and caspase activation, and failure of a caspase inhibitor or necrostatin-1s to prevent death. IL-1β/TNF depleted autophagy-deficient cells of ATP, and ATP depletion and cell death were prevented by supplementation with the energy substrate pyruvate or oleate. Pharmacological inhibitors and genetic knockdown studies demonstrated that IL-1β/TNF-induced necrosis resulted from lysosomal permeabilization and release of cathepsins B and L in autophagy-deficient cells. Mice with a tamoxifen-inducible, hepatocyte-specific Atg5 knockout were similarly sensitized to cathepsin-dependent hepatocellular injury and death from IL-1β/TNF in combination, but neither IL-1β nor TNF alone. Knockout mice had increased hepatic inflammation, and IL-1β/TNF-treated, autophagy-deficient AML12 cells secreted exosomes with proinflammatory damage-associated molecular patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The findings delineate mechanisms by which decreased hepatocyte autophagy promotes IL-1β/TNF-induced necrosis from impaired energy homeostasis and lysosomal permeabilization and inflammation through the secretion of exosomal damage-associated molecular patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nuclear innate sensors for nucleic acids in immunity and inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate sensors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to initiate innate immune response by activating downstream signaling. These evolutionarily conserved innate sensors usually locate in the plasma membrane or cytoplasm. However, the nucleus-localized innate sensors are recently found to detect pathogenic nucleic acids for initiating innate response, demonstrating a complicated crosstalk with cytoplasmic sensors and signaling molecules to form an elaborate tiered innate signaling network between nucleus and cytoplasm. Furthermore, these nuclear innate sensors evolve varied mechanisms for discriminating self from non-self nucleic acids to maintain immune homeostasis and avoid autoinflammatory immune response. In this review, we summarize the recent findings on the identification of nuclear innate sensors for nucleic acids, such as hnRNPA2B1, IFI16, SAFA, and their roles in host defense and inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interferon regulatory factor 1 regulates PANoptosis to prevent colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32554929/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) regulates diverse biological functions, including modulation of cellular responses involved in tumorigenesis. Genetic mutations and altered IRF1 function are associated with several cancers. Although the function of IRF1 in the immunobiology of cancer is emerging, IRF1-specific mechanisms regulating tumorigenesis and tissue homeostasis in vivo are not clear. Here, we found that mice lacking IRF1 were hypersusceptible to colorectal tumorigenesis. IRF1 functions in both the myeloid and epithelial compartments to confer protection against AOM/DSS-induced colorectal tumorigenesis. We further found that IRF1 also prevents tumorigenesis in a spontaneous mouse model of colorectal cancer. The attenuated cell death in the colons of Irf1-/- mice was due to defective pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis). IRF1 does not regulate inflammation and the inflammasome in the colon. Overall, our study identified IRF1 as an upstream regulator of PANoptosis to induce cell death during colitis-associated tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is an essential sensor of cytosolic DNA and critically mediates innate immune responses and autoimmunity. Modulating the activity and stability of cGAS provides potential strategies for treating viral or autoimmune diseases. Here, we report that ubiquitin-specific protease 29 (USP29) deubiquitinates and stabilizes cGAS and promotes cellular antiviral responses and autoimmunity. Knockdown or knockout of USP29 severely impairs Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)- or cytosolic DNA-induced expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. Consistently, Usp29m/m mice produce decreased type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines after HSV-1 infection and are hypersensitive to HSV-1 infection compared to the wild-type littermates. In addition, genetic ablation of USP29 in Trex1-/- mice eliminated the detectable pathological and molecular autoimmune phenotypes. Mechanistically, USP29 constitutively interacts with cGAS, deconjugates K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from cGAS and stabilizes cGAS in uninfected cells or after HSV-1 infection. Reconstitution of cGAS into Usp29-/- cells fully rescues type I IFN induction and cellular antiviral responses after HSV-1 infection. Our findings thus reveal a critical role of USP29 in the innate antiviral responses against DNA viruses and autoimmune diseases and provide insight into the regulation of cGAS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TASL is the SLC15A4-associated adaptor for IRF5 activation by TLR7-9</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have a crucial role in the recognition of pathogens and initiation of immune responses. Here we show that a previously uncharacterized protein encoded by CXorf21-a gene that is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus-interacts with the endolysosomal transporter SLC15A4, an essential but poorly understood component of the endolysosomal TLR machinery also linked to autoimmune disease. Loss of this type-I-interferon-inducible protein, which we refer to as &amp;lsquo;TLR adaptor interacting with SLC15A4 on the lysosome&amp;rsquo; (TASL), abrogated responses to endolysosomal TLR agonists in both primary and transformed human immune cells. Deletion of SLC15A4 or TASL specifically impaired the activation of the IRF pathway without affecting NF-κB and MAPK signalling, which indicates that ligand recognition and TLR engagement in the endolysosome occurred normally. Extensive mutagenesis of TASL demonstrated that its localization and function relies on the interaction with SLC15A4. TASL contains a conserved pLxIS motif (in which p denotes a hydrophilic residue and x denotes any residue) that mediates the recruitment and activation of IRF5. This finding shows that TASL is an innate immune adaptor for TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 signalling, revealing a clear mechanistic analogy with the IRF3 adaptors STING, MAVS and TRIF. The identification of TASL as the component that links endolysosomal TLRs to the IRF5 transcription factor via SLC15A4 provides a mechanistic explanation for the involvement of these proteins in systemic lupus erythematosus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GSDME-Dependent Incomplete Pyroptosis Permits Selective IL-1α Release under Caspase-1 Inhibition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NLRP3 inflammasome induces necrotic cell death in the absence of caspase-1/11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASC initiates GSDME-dependent pyroptosis via caspase-8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-1α, but not IL-1β, is released during Casp1/11-independent pyroptosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 permits IL-1α release during pyroptosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that is characterized by gasdermin processing and increased membrane permeability. Caspase-1 and caspase-11 have been considered to be essential for gasdermin D processing associated with inflammasome activation. In the present study, we found that NLRP3 inflammasome activation induces delayed necrotic cell death via ASC in caspase-1/11-deficient macrophages. Furthermore, ASC-mediated caspase-8 activation and subsequent gasdermin E processing are necessary for caspase-1-independent necrotic cell death. We define this necrotic cell death as incomplete pyroptosis because IL-1β release, a key feature of pyroptosis, is absent, whereas IL-1α release is induced. Notably, unprocessed pro-IL-1β forms a molecular complex to be retained inside pyroptotic cells. Moreover, incomplete pyroptosis accompanied by IL-1α release is observed under the pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 with VX765. These findings suggest that caspase-1 inhibition during NLRP3 inflammasome activation modulates forms of cell death and permits the release of IL-1α from dying cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>O-GlcNAc transferase promotes influenza A virus-induced cytokine storm by targeting interferon regulatory factor-5</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we demonstrated an essential function of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP)-associated O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) signaling in influenza A virus (IAV)-induced cytokine storm. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), a key enzyme for protein O-GlcNAcylation, mediated IAV-induced cytokine production. Upon investigating the mechanisms driving this event, we determined that IAV induced OGT to bind to interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF5), leading to O-GlcNAcylation of IRF5 on serine-430. O-GlcNAcylation of IRF5 is required for K63-linked ubiquitination of IRF5 and subsequent cytokine production. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that IRF5 is O-GlcNAcylated, and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines correlated with higher levels of blood glucose in IAV-infected patients. We identified a molecular mechanism by which HBP-mediated O-GlcNAcylation regulates IRF5 function during IAV infection, highlighting the importance of glucose metabolism in IAV-induced cytokine storm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Glycogen metabolism regulates macrophage-mediated acute inflammatory responses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current understanding of how sugar metabolism affects inflammatory pathways in macrophages is incomplete. Here, we show that glycogen metabolism is an important event that controls macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses. IFN-γ/LPS treatment stimulates macrophages to synthesize glycogen, which is then channeled through glycogenolysis to generate G6P and further through the pentose phosphate pathway to yield abundant NADPH, ensuring high levels of reduced glutathione for inflammatory macrophage survival. Meanwhile, glycogen metabolism also increases UDPG levels and the receptor P2Y&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; in macrophages. The UDPG/P2Y&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; signaling pathway not only upregulates the expression of STAT1 via activating RARβ but also promotes STAT1 phosphorylation by downregulating phosphatase TC45. Blockade of this glycogen metabolic pathway disrupts acute inflammatory responses in multiple mouse models. Glycogen metabolism also regulates inflammatory responses in patients with sepsis. These findings show that glycogen metabolism in macrophages is an important regulator and indicate strategies that might be used to treat acute inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of type 1 interferons in coagulation induced by gram-negative bacteria</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32016282/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infection not only stimulates innate immune responses but also activates coagulation cascades. Overactivation of the coagulation system in bacterial sepsis leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a life-threatening condition. However, the mechanisms by which bacterial infection activates the coagulation cascade are not fully understood. Here we show that type 1 interferons (IFNs), a widely expressed family of cytokines that orchestrate innate antiviral and antibacterial immunity, mediate bacterial infection-induced DIC by amplifying the release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) into the bloodstream. Inhibition of the expression of type 1 IFNs and disruption of their receptor IFN-α/βR or downstream effector (eg, HMGB1) uniformly decreased gram-negative bacteria-induced DIC. Mechanistically, extracellular HMGB1 markedly increased the procoagulant activity of tissue factor by promoting the externalization of phosphatidylserine to the outer cell surface, where phosphatidylserine assembles a complex of cofactor-proteases of the coagulation cascades. These findings not only provide novel insights into the link between innate immune responses and coagulation, but they also open a new avenue for developing novel therapeutic strategies to prevent DIC in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biological function of Z-DNA and Z-RNA, nucleic acid structures with a left-handed double helix, is poorly understood. Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1; also known as DAI or DLM-1) is a nucleic acid sensor that contains two Zα domains that bind Z-DNA and Z-RNA. ZBP1 mediates host defence against some viruses by sensing viral nucleic acids. RIPK1 deficiency, or mutation of its RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM), triggers ZBP1-dependent necroptosis and inflammation in mice. However, the mechanisms that induce ZBP1 activation in the absence of viral infection remain unknown. Here we show that Zα-dependent sensing of endogenous ligands induces ZBP1-mediated perinatal lethality in mice expressing RIPK1 with mutated RHIM (&lt;em&gt;Ripk1&lt;sup&gt;mR/mR&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), skin inflammation in mice with epidermis-specific RIPK1 deficiency (RIPK1&lt;sup&gt;E-KO&lt;/sup&gt;) and colitis in mice with intestinal epithelial-specific FADD deficiency (FADD&lt;sup&gt;IEC-KO&lt;/sup&gt;). Consistently, functional Zα domains were required for ZBP1-induced necroptosis in fibroblasts that were treated with caspase inhibitors or express RIPK1 with mutated RHIM. Inhibition of nuclear export triggered the Zα-dependent activation of RIPK3 in the nucleus resulting in cell death, which suggests that ZBP1 may recognize nuclear Z-form nucleic acids. We found that ZBP1 constitutively bound cellular double-stranded RNA in a Zα-dependent manner. Complementary reads derived from endogenous retroelements were detected in epidermal RNA, which suggests that double-stranded RNA derived from these retroelements may act as a Zα-domain ligand that triggers the activation of ZBP1. Collectively, our results provide evidence that the sensing of endogenous Z-form nucleic acids by ZBP1 triggers RIPK3-dependent necroptosis and inflammation, which could underlie the development of chronic inflammatory conditions-particularly in individuals with mutations in &lt;em&gt;RIPK1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CASP8&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BRD4 inhibition exerts anti-viral activity through DNA damage-dependent innate immune responses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromatin dynamics regulated by epigenetic modification is crucial in genome stability and gene expression. Various epigenetic mechanisms have been identified in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Here, we examined the effects of ten epigenetic agents on pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection by using GFP-reporter assays. Inhibitors of bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4), which receives much more attention in cancer than viral infection, was found to exhibit substantial anti-viral activity against PRV as well as a range of DNA and RNA viruses. We further demonstrated that BRD4 inhibition boosted a robust innate immune response. BRD4 inhibition also de-compacted chromatin structure and induced the DNA damage response, thereby triggering the activation of cGAS-mediated innate immunity and increasing host resistance to viral infection both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effect of BRD4 inhibition on viral infection was mainly attributed to the attenuation of viral attachment. Our findings reveal a unique mechanism through which BRD4 inhibition restrains viral infection and points to its potent therapeutic value for viral infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Caspases in Cell Death, Inflammation, and Pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/32017655/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caspases are a family of conserved cysteine proteases that play key roles in programmed cell death and inflammation. In multicellular organisms, caspases are activated via macromolecular signaling complexes that bring inactive procaspases together and promote their proximity-induced autoactivation and proteolytic processing. Activation of caspases ultimately results in programmed execution of cell death, and the nature of this cell death is determined by the specific caspases involved. Pioneering new research has unraveled distinct roles and cross talk of caspases in the regulation of programmed cell death, inflammation, and innate immune responses. In-depth understanding of these mechanisms is essential to foster the development of precise therapeutic targets to treat autoinflammatory disorders, infectious diseases, and cancer. This review focuses on mechanisms governing caspase activation and programmed cell death with special emphasis on the recent progress in caspase cross talk and caspase-driven gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>lncRNA Sensing of a Viral Suppressor of RNAi Activates Non-canonical Innate Immune Signaling in Drosophila</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiviral immunity in insects is mediated by the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Viruses evade antiviral RNAi by expressing virulence factors known as viral suppressors of RNAi (VSR). Here, we report the identification of VINR, a Drosophila VSR-interacting long non-coding (lnc) RNA that activates non-canonical innate immune signaling upon detection of the dsRNA-binding VSR of Drosophila C virus (DCV). VINR is required for the induction of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes but dispensable for antiviral RNAi. VINR functions by preventing the ubiquitin proteasome-dependent degradation of Cactin, a coiled-coil and arginine-serine-rich domain-containing protein that regulates a non-cannonical antimicrobial pathway for AMP induction. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of VINR in Drosophila cells enhances DCV replication independently of antiviral RNAi, and VINR-knockout adult flies exhibit enhanced disease susceptibility to DCV and bacteria. Our findings reveal a counter counter-defense strategy activated by a lncRNA in response to the viral suppression of the primary antiviral RNAi immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lymphoid cells that produce interleukin (IL)-17 cytokines protect barrier tissues from pathogenic microbes but are also prominent effectors of inflammation and autoimmune disease. T helper 17 (Th17) cells, defined by RORγt-dependent production of IL-17A and IL-17F, exert homeostatic functions in the gut upon microbiota-directed differentiation from naive CD4+ T cells. In the non-pathogenic setting, their cytokine production is regulated by serum amyloid A proteins (SAA1 and SAA2) secreted by adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. However, Th17 cell behaviors vary markedly according to their environment. Here, we show that SAAs additionally direct a pathogenic pro-inflammatory Th17 cell differentiation program, acting directly on T cells in collaboration with STAT3-activating cytokines. Using loss- and gain-of-function mouse models, we show that SAA1, SAA2, and SAA3 have distinct systemic and local functions in promoting Th17-mediated inflammatory diseases. These studies suggest that T cell signaling pathways modulated by the SAAs may be attractive targets for anti-inflammatory therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of diverse biological processes; however, their function in macrophage activation is undefined. We describe a new regulatory mechanism, where an unreported lncRNA, &lt;em&gt;PTPRE-AS1&lt;/em&gt;, targets receptor-type tyrosine protein phosphatase ε (PTPRE) to regulate macrophage activation. &lt;em&gt;PTPRE-AS1&lt;/em&gt; was selectively expressed in IL-4-stimulated macrophages, and its knockdown promoted M2 macrophage activation via MAPK/ERK 1/2 pathway. In vivo, PTPRE-AS1 deficiency enhanced IL-4-mediated M2 macrophage activation and accelerated pulmonary allergic inflammation while reducing chemical-induced colitis. Mechanistically, &lt;em&gt;PTPRE-AS1&lt;/em&gt; bound WDR5 directly, modulating H3K4me3 of the &lt;em&gt;PTPRE&lt;/em&gt; promoter to regulate &lt;em&gt;PTPRE&lt;/em&gt;-dependent signaling during M2 macrophage activation. Further, the expression of &lt;em&gt;PTPRE-AS1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PTPRE&lt;/em&gt; was significantly lower in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with allergic asthma. These results provide evidence supporting the importance of &lt;em&gt;PTPRE-AS1&lt;/em&gt; in controlling macrophage function and the potential utility of &lt;em&gt;PTPRE-AS1&lt;/em&gt; as a target for controlling inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bacterial Endotoxin Activates the Coagulation Cascade through Gasdermin D-Dependent Phosphatidylserine Exposure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deletion of caspase-11 prevents disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in sepsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deletion of GSDMD prevents caspase-11- and TF-mediated DIC in endotoxemia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GSDMD deficiency inhibits endotoxin-induced TF activation by reducing PS exposure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of GSDMD by caspase-11 triggers Ca2+-dependent PS exposure through TMEM16F&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive activation of the coagulation system leads to life-threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Here, we examined the mechanisms underlying the activation of coagulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major cell-wall component of Gram-negative bacteria. We found that caspase-11, a cytosolic LPS receptor, activated the coagulation cascade. Caspase-11 enhanced the activation of tissue factor (TF), an initiator of coagulation, through triggering the formation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores and subsequent phosphatidylserine exposure, in a manner independent of cell death. GSDMD pores mediated calcium influx, which induced phosphatidylserine exposure through transmembrane protein 16F, a calcium-dependent phospholipid scramblase. Deletion of &lt;em&gt;Casp11&lt;/em&gt;, ablation of &lt;em&gt;Gsdmd&lt;/em&gt;, or neutralization of phosphatidylserine or TF prevented LPS-induced DIC. In septic patients, plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1β, biomarkers of GSDMD activation, correlated with phosphatidylserine exposure in peripheral leukocytes and DIC scores. Our findings mechanistically link immune recognition of LPS to coagulation, with implications for the treatment of DIC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Age-Related Dopaminergic Innervation Augments T Helper 2-Type Allergic Inflammation in the Postnatal Lung</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young children are more susceptible to developing allergic asthma than adults. As neural innervation of the peripheral tissue continues to develop after birth, neurons may modulate tissue inflammation in an age-related manner. Here we showed that sympathetic nerves underwent a dopaminergic-to-adrenergic transition during post-natal development of the lung in mice and humans. Dopamine signaled through a specific dopamine receptor (DRD4) to promote T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation. The dopamine-DRD4 pathway acted synergistically with the cytokine IL-4 by upregulating IL-2-STAT5 signaling and reducing inhibitory histone trimethylation at Th2 gene loci. In murine models of allergen exposure, the dopamine-DRD4 pathway augmented Th2 inflammation in the lungs of young mice. However, this pathway operated marginally after sympathetic nerves became adrenergic in the adult lung. Taken together, the communication between dopaminergic nerves and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells provides an age-related mechanism underlying the susceptibility to allergic inflammation in the early lung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activated macrophages switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, similar to the Warburg effect, presenting a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory disease. The endogenous metabolite itaconate has been reported to regulate macrophage function, but its precise mechanism is not clear. Here, we show that 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI, a cell-permeable itaconate derivative) directly alkylates cysteine residue 22 on the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH and decreases its enzyme activity. Glycolytic flux analysis by U13C glucose tracing provides evidence that 4-OI blocks glycolytic flux at GAPDH. 4-OI thereby downregulates aerobic glycolysis in activated macrophages, which is required for its anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory effects of 4-OI are replicated by heptelidic acid, 2-DG and reversed by increasing wild-type (but not C22A mutant) GAPDH expression. 4-OI protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality in vivo and inhibits cytokine release. These findings show that 4-OI has anti-inflammatory effects by targeting GAPDH to decrease aerobic glycolysis in macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DAMP-sensing receptors in sterile inflammation and inflammatory diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune system has the capacity to detect ’non-self’ molecules derived from pathogens, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, via pattern recognition receptors. In addition, an increasing number of endogenous host-derived molecules, termed damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), have been found to be sensed by various innate immune receptors. The recognition of DAMPs, which are produced or released by damaged and dying cells, promotes sterile inflammation, which is important for tissue repair and regeneration, but can also lead to the development of numerous inflammatory diseases, such as metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Here we examine recent discoveries concerning the roles of DAMP-sensing receptors in sterile inflammation and in diseases resulting from dysregulated sterile inflammation, and then discuss insights into the cross-regulation of these receptors and their ligands.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DDX3X acts as a live-or-die checkpoint in stressed cells by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cellular stress response has a vital role in regulating homeostasis by modulating cell survival and death. Stress granules are cytoplasmic compartments that enable cells to survive various stressors. Defects in the assembly and disassembly of stress granules are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, aberrant antiviral responses and cancer. Inflammasomes are multi-protein heteromeric complexes that sense molecular patterns that are associated with damage or intracellular pathogens, and assemble into cytosolic compartments known as ASC specks to facilitate the activation of caspase-1. Activation of inflammasomes induces the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 and drives cell fate towards pyroptosis—a form of programmed inflammatory cell death that has major roles in health and disease. Although both stress granules and inflammasomes can be triggered by the sensing of cellular stress, they drive contrasting cell-fate decisions. The crosstalk between stress granules and inflammasomes and how this informs cell fate has not been well-studied. Here we show that the induction of stress granules specifically inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation, ASC speck formation and pyroptosis. The stress granule protein DDX3X interacts with NLRP3 to drive inflammasome activation. Assembly of stress granules leads to the sequestration of DDX3X, and thereby the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Stress granules and the NLRP3 inflammasome compete for DDX3X molecules to coordinate the activation of innate responses and subsequent cell-fate decisions under stress conditions. Induction of stress granules or loss of DDX3X in the myeloid compartment leads to a decrease in the production of inflammasome-dependent cytokines in vivo. Our findings suggest that macrophages use the availability of DDX3X to interpret stress signals and choose between pro-survival stress granules and pyroptotic ASC specks. Together, our data demonstrate the role of DDX3X in driving NLRP3 inflammasome and stress granule assembly, and suggest a rheostat-like mechanistic paradigm for regulating live-or-die cell-fate decisions under stress conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting Degradation of the Transcription Factor C/EBPβ Reduces Lung Fibrosis by Restoring Activity of the Ubiquitin-Editing Enzyme A20 in Macrophages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although recent progress provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), rare anti-PF therapeutics show definitive promise for treating this disease. Repeated lung epithelial injury results in injury-repairing response and inflammation, which drive the development of PF. Here, we report that chronic lung injury inactivated the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, causing progressive accumulation of the transcription factor C/EBPβ in alveolar macrophages (AMs) from PF patients and mice, which upregulated a number of immunosuppressive and profibrotic factors promoting PF development. In response to chronic lung injury, elevated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) interacted with and phosphorylated A20 to suppress C/EBPβ degradation. Ectopic expression of A20 or pharmacological restoration of A20 activity by disturbing the A20-GSK-3β interaction accelerated C/EBPβ degradation and showed potent therapeutic efficacy against experimental PF. Our study indicates that a regulatory mechanism of the GSK-3β-A20-C/EBPβ axis in AMs may be a potential target for treating PF and fibroproliferative lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Toll-like receptor mediated inflammation requires FASN-dependent MYD88 palmitoylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31427815/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll-like receptor (TLR)/myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MYD88) signaling aggravates sepsis by impairing neutrophil migration to infection sites. However, the role of intracellular fatty acids in TLR/MYD88 signaling is unclear. Here, inhibition of fatty acid synthase by C75 improved neutrophil chemotaxis and increased the survival of mice with sepsis in cecal ligation puncture and lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock models. C75 specifically blocked TLR/MYD88 signaling in neutrophils. Treatment with GSK2194069 that targets a different domain of fatty acid synthase, did not block TLR signaling or MYD88 palmitoylation. De novo fatty acid synthesis and CD36-mediated exogenous fatty acid incorporation contributed to MYD88 palmitoylation. The binding of IRAK4 to the MYD88 intermediate domain and downstream signal activation required MYD88 palmitoylation at cysteine 113. MYD88 was palmitoylated by ZDHHC6, and ZDHHC6 knockdown decreased MYD88 palmitoylation and TLR/MYD88 activation upon lipopolysaccharide stimulus. Thus, intracellular saturated fatty acid-dependent palmitoylation of MYD88 by ZDHHC6 is a therapeutic target of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protection against influenza infection requires early recognition by inflammatory dendritic cells through C-type lectin receptor SIGN-R1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31358982/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early phase of influenza infection occurs in the upper respiratory tract and the trachea, but little is known about the initial events of virus recognition and control of viral dissemination by the immune system. Here, we report that inflammatory dendritic cells (IDCs) are recruited to the trachea shortly after influenza infection through type I interferon-mediated production of the chemokine CCL2. We further show that recruited IDCs express the C-type lectin receptor SIGN-R1, which mediates direct recognition of the virus by interacting with N-linked glycans present in glycoproteins of the virion envelope. Activation of IDCs via SIGN-R1 triggers the production of the chemokines CCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10, which initiate the recruitment of protective natural killer (NK) cells in the infected trachea. In the absence of SIGN-R1, the recruitment and activation of NK cells is impaired, leading to uncontrolled viral proliferation. In sum, our results provide insight into the orchestration of the early cellular and molecular events involved in immune protection against influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-Cell Virus Sequencing of Influenza Infections That Trigger Innate Immunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza virus-infected cells vary widely in their expression of viral genes and only occasionally activate innate immunity. Here, we develop a new method to assess how the genetic variation in viral populations contributes to this heterogeneity. We do this by determining the transcriptome and full-length sequences of all viral genes in single cells infected with a nominally &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; stock of influenza virus. Most cells are infected by virions with defects, some of which increase the frequency of innate-immune activation. These immunostimulatory defects are diverse and include mutations that perturb the function of the viral polymerase protein PB1, large internal deletions in viral genes, and failure to express the virus&amp;rsquo;s interferon antagonist NS1. However, immune activation remains stochastic in cells infected by virions with these defects and occasionally is triggered even by virions that express unmutated copies of all genes. Our work shows that the diverse spectrum of defects in influenza virus populations contributes to-but does not completely explain-the heterogeneity in viral gene expression and immune activation in single infected cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because influenza virus has a high mutation rate, many cells are infected by mutated virions. But so far, it has been impossible to fully characterize the sequence of the virion infecting any given cell, since conventional techniques such as flow cytometry and single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) only detect if a protein or transcript is present, not its sequence. Here we develop a new approach that uses long-read PacBio sequencing to determine the sequences of virions infecting single cells. We show that viral genetic variation explains some but not all of the cell-to-cell variability in viral gene expression and innate immune induction. Overall, our study provides the first complete picture of how viral mutations affect the course of infection in single cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caspases are an evolutionary conserved family of cysteine proteases that are centrally involved in cell death and inflammation responses. A wealth of foundational insight into the molecular mechanisms that control caspase activation has emerged in recent years. Important advancements include the identification of additional inflammasome platforms and pathways that regulate activation of inflammatory caspases; the discovery of gasdermin D as the effector of pyroptosis and interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 secretion; and the existence of substantial crosstalk between inflammatory and apoptotic initiator caspases. A better understanding of the mechanisms regulating caspase activation has supported initial efforts to modulate dysfunctional cell death and inflammation pathways in a suite of communicable, inflammatory, malignant, metabolic, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review current understanding of caspase biology with a prime focus on the inflammatory caspases and outline important topics for future experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we showed that housing Mx1 congenic mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11-deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring of the cytosolic compartment by the innate immune system for pathogen-encoded products or pathogen activities often enables the activation of a subset of caspases. In most cases, the cytosolic surveillance pathways are coupled to activation of caspase-1 via canonical inflammasome complexes. A related set of caspases, caspase-11 in rodents and caspase-4 and caspase-5 in humans, monitors the cytosol for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Direct activation of caspase-11, caspase-4 and caspase-5 by intracellular LPS elicits the lytic cell death called ‘pyroptosis’, which occurs in multiple cell types. The pyroptosis is executed by the pore-forming protein GSDMD, which is activated by cleavage mediated by caspase-11, caspase-4 or caspase-5. In monocytes, formation of GSDMD pores can induce activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome for maturation of the cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Caspase-11-mediated pyroptosis in response to cytosolic LPS is critical for antibacterial defense and septic shock. Here we review the emerging literature on the sensing of cytosolic LPS and its regulation and pathophysiological functions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apoptotic Caspases Suppress Type I Interferon Production via the Cleavage of cGAS, MAVS, and IRF3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral infection triggers host defenses through pattern-recognition receptor-mediated cytokine production, inflammasome activation, and apoptosis of the infected cells. Inflammasome-activated caspases are known to cleave cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Here, we found that apoptotic caspases are critically involved in regulating both DNA and RNA virus-triggered host defenses, in which activated caspase-3 cleaved cGAS, MAVS, and IRF3 to prevent cytokine overproduction. Caspase-3 was exclusively required in human cells, whereas caspase-7 was involved only in murine cells to inactivate cGAS, reflecting distinct regulatory mechanisms in different species. Caspase-mediated cGAS cleavage was enhanced in the presence of dsDNA. Alternative MAVS cleavage sites were used to ensure the inactivation of this critical protein. Elevated type I IFNs were detected in caspase-3-deficient cells without any infection. Casp3-/- mice consistently showed increased resistance to viral infection and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our results demonstrate that apoptotic caspases control innate immunity and maintain immune homeostasis against viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diverging inflammasome signals in tumorigenesis and potential targeting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammasomes are molecular platforms that assemble upon sensing various intracellular stimuli. Inflammasome assembly leads to activation of caspase 1, thereby promoting the secretion of bioactive interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 and inducing an inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis. Effectors of the inflammasome efficiently drive an immune response, primarily providing protection against microbial infections and mediating control over sterile insults. However, aberrant inflammasome signalling is associated with pathogenesis of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration and malignancies. Chronic inflammation perpetuated by inflammasome activation plays a central role in all stages of tumorigenesis, including immunosuppression, proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. Conversely, inflammasome signalling also contributes to tumour suppression by maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, which portrays the diverse roles of inflammasomes in tumorigenesis. Studies have underscored the importance of environmental factors, such as diet and gut microbiota, in inflammasome signalling, which in turn influences tumorigenesis.

      <title>CCR7 Chemokine Receptor-Inducible lnc-Dpf3 Restrains Dendritic Cell Migration by Inhibiting HIF-1α-Mediated Glycolysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CCR7 chemokine receptor stimulation induces rapid but transient dendritic cell (DC) migration toward draining lymph nodes, which is critical for the initiation of protective immunity and maintenance of immune homeostasis. The mechanisms for terminating CCR7-mediated DC migration remain incompletely understood. Here we have identified a long non-coding RNA lnc-Dpf3 whose feedback restrained CCR7-mediated DC migration. CCR7 stimulation upregulated lnc-Dpf3 via removing N6-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) modification to prevent RNA degradation. DC-specific lnc-Dpf3 deficiency increased CCR7-mediated DC migration, leading to exaggerated adaptive immune responses and inflammatory injuries. Mechanistically, CCR7 stimulation activated the HIF-1α transcription factor pathway in DCs, leading to metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis for DC migration. lnc-Dpf3 directly bound to HIF-1α and suppressed HIF-1α-dependent transcription of the glycolytic gene Ldha, thus inhibiting DC glycolytic metabolism and migratory capacity. We demonstrate a critical role for CCR7-inducible lnc-Dpf3 in coupling epigenetic and metabolic pathways to feedback-control DC migration and inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fever Promotes T Lymphocyte Trafficking via a Thermal Sensory Pathway Involving Heat Shock Protein 90 and α4 Integrins</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/30650373/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fever is an evolutionarily conserved response that confers survival benefits during infection. However, the underlying mechanism remains obscure. Here, we report that fever promoted T lymphocyte trafficking through heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)-induced α4 integrin activation and signaling in T cells. By inducing selective binding of Hsp90 to α4 integrins, but not β2 integrins, fever increased α4-integrin-mediated T cell adhesion and transmigration. Mechanistically, Hsp90 bound to the α4 tail and activated α4 integrins via inside-out signaling. Moreover, the N and C termini of one Hsp90 molecule simultaneously bound to two α4 tails, leading to dimerization and clustering of α4 integrins on the cell membrane and subsequent activation of the FAK-RhoA pathway. Abolishment of Hsp90-α4 interaction inhibited fever-induced T cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes and impaired the clearance of bacterial infection. Our findings identify the Hsp90-α4-integrin axis as a thermal sensory pathway that promotes T lymphocyte trafficking and enhances immune surveillance during infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza viruses inhabit a wide range of host environments using a limited repertoire of protein components. Unlike viruses with stereotyped shapes, influenza produces virions with significant morphological variability even within clonal populations. Whether this tendency to form pleiomorphic virions is coupled to compositional heterogeneity and whether it affects replicative fitness remains unclear. Here, we address these questions by developing a strain of influenza A virus amenable to rapid compositional characterization through quantitative, site-specific labeling of viral proteins. Using this strain, we find that influenza A produces virions with broad variations in size and composition from even single infected cells. This phenotypic variability contributes to virus survival during environmental challenges, including exposure to antivirals. Complementing genetic adaptations that act over larger populations and longer times, this “low-fidelity” assembly of influenza A virus allows small populations to survive environments that fluctuate over individual replication cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Endotoxin Delivery Protein HMGB1 Mediates Caspase-11-Dependent Lethality in Sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/30314759/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/30314759/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hepatocyte-released HMGB1 mediates caspase-11-dependent lethality in sepsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HMGB1-LPS complexes are taken up by macrophages and endothelial cells via RAGE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HMGB1 destabilizes phagolysosomes for the transfer of LPS to cytosolic caspase-11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neutralizing extracellular HMGB1 inhibits caspase-11 activation in sepsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caspase-11, a cytosolic endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide: LPS) receptor, mediates pyroptosis, a lytic form of cell death. Caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis mediates lethality in endotoxemia, but it is unclear how LPS is delivered into the cytosol for the activation of caspase-11. Here we discovered that hepatocyte-released high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was required for caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and lethality in endotoxemia and bacterial sepsis. Mechanistically, hepatocyte-released HMGB1 bound LPS and targeted its internalization into the lysosomes of macrophages and endothelial cells via the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). Subsequently, HMGB1 permeabilized the phospholipid bilayer in the acidic environment of lysosomes. This resulted in LPS leakage into the cytosol and caspase-11 activation. Depletion of hepatocyte HMGB1, inhibition of hepatocyte HMGB1 release, neutralizing extracellular HMGB1, or RAGE deficiency prevented caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and death in endotoxemia and bacterial sepsis. These findings indicate that HMGB1 interacts with LPS to mediate caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis in lethal sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phosphorylation-Mediated IFN-γR2 Membrane Translocation Is Required to Activate Macrophage Innate Response</title>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a critical step during innate response, the cytoplasmic β subunit (IFN-γR2) of interferon-γ receptor (IFN-γR) is induced and translocates to plasma membrane to join α subunit to form functional IFN-γR to mediate IFN-γ signaling. However, the mechanism driving membrane translocation and its significance remain largely unknown. We found, unexpectedly, that mice deficient in E-selectin, an endothelial cell-specific adhesion molecule, displayed impaired innate activation of macrophages upon Listeria monocytogenes infection yet had increased circulating IFN-γ. Inflammatory macrophages from E-selectin-deficient mice had less surface IFN-γR2 and impaired IFN-γ signaling. BTK elicited by extrinsic E-selectin engagement phosphorylates cytoplasmic IFN-γR2, facilitating EFhd2 binding and promoting IFN-γR2 trafficking from Golgi to cell membrane. Our findings demonstrate that membrane translocation of cytoplasmic IFN-γR2 is required to activate macrophage innate response against intracellular bacterial infection, identifying the assembly of functional cytokine receptors on cell membrane as an important layer in innate activation and cytokine signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Membrane Potential- and Calpain-Dependent Reversal of Caspase-1 Inhibition Regulates Canonical NLRP3 Inflammasome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/30157429/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NLRP3 inflammasome senses a range of cellular disturbances, although no consensus exists regarding a common mechanism. Canonical NLRP3 activation is blocked by high extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, regardless of the activating signal. We report here that canonical NLRP3 activation leads to Ca2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux and increased calpain activity. Activated calpain releases a pool of Caspase-1 sequestered by the cytoskeleton to regulate NLRP3 activation. Using electrophysiological recording, we found that resting-state eukaryotic membrane potential (MP) is required for this calpain activity, and depolarization by high extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or artificial hyperpolarization results in the inhibition of calpain. Therefore, the MP/Ca2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/calpain/Caspase-1 axis acts as an independent regulatory mechanism for NLRP3 activity. This finding provides mechanistic insight into high K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated inhibition of NLRP3 activation, and it offers an alternative model of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that does not involve K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self-Recognition of an Inducible Host lncRNA by RIG-I Feedback Restricts Innate Immune Response</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate RNA sensor RIG-I is critical in the initiation of antiviral type I interferons (IFNs) production upon recognition of &amp;ldquo;non-self&amp;rdquo; viral RNAs. Here, we identify a host-derived, IFN-inducible long noncoding RNA, lnc-Lsm3b, that can compete with viral RNAs in the binding of RIG-I monomers and feedback inactivate the RIG-I innate function at late stage of innate response. Mechanistically, binding of lnc-Lsm3b restricts RIG-I protein&amp;rsquo;s conformational shift and prevents downstream signaling, thereby terminating type I IFNs production. Multivalent structural motifs and long-stem structure are critical features of lnc-Lsm3b for RIG-I binding and inhibition. These data reveal a non-canonical self-recognition mode in the regulation of immune response and demonstrate an important role of an inducible &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; lncRNA acting as a potent molecular decoy actively saturating RIG-I binding sites to restrict the duration of &amp;ldquo;non-self&amp;rdquo; RNA-induced innate immune response and maintaining immune homeostasis, with potential utility in inflammatory disease management.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino2 mediates priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NLRP3 inflammasome has an important function in inflammation by promoting the processing of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to their mature bioactive forms, and by inducing cell death via pyroptosis. Here we show a critical function of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino2 in facilitating activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Pellino2-deficient mice and myeloid cells have impaired activation of NLRP3 in response to toll-like receptor priming, NLRP3 stimuli and bacterial challenge. These functions of Pellino2 in the NLRP3 pathway are dependent on Pellino2 FHA and RING-like domains, with Pellino2 promoting the ubiquitination of NLRP3 during the priming phase of activation. We also identify a negative function of IRAK1 in the NLRP3 inflammasome, and describe a counter-regulatory relationship between IRAK1 and Pellino2. Our findings reveal a Pellino2-mediated regulatory signaling system that controls activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By exerting pro- and anti-tumorigenic actions, tumor-infiltrating immune cells can profoundly influence tumor progression, as well as the success of anti-cancer therapies. Therefore, the quantification of tumor-infiltrating immune cells holds the promise to unveil the multi-faceted role of the immune system in human cancers and its involvement in tumor escape mechanisms and response to therapy. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can be quantified from RNA sequencing data of human tumors using bioinformatics approaches. In this review, we describe state-of-the-art computational methods for the quantification of immune cells from transcriptomics data and discuss the open challenges that must be addressed to accurately quantify immune infiltrates from RNA sequencing data of human bulk tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting neural reflex circuits in immunity to treat kidney disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/28970585/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural circuits that control immunity and inflammation provide novel targets for the treatment of kidney disease and hypertension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) blocks splenic-dependent systemic inflammation and acute kidney injury (AKI); non-invasive, nonpharmacological approaches to activate the CAP include ultrasound application and vagus nerve stimulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural circuits that directly regulate kidney function or carry sensory feedback from the kidney to the central nervous system could provide additional mechanisms for bidirectional neuroimmunomodulation of kidney disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactions between neural circuits and the immune system have important roles in the pathogenesis of hypertension and renal fibrosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further defining neuroimmunomodulatory pathways in hypertension could enable the development of selective neuronal stimulatory or inhibitory strategies for lowering blood pressure that could potentially be more effective than renal denervation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optogenetic tools provide unprecedented opportunities to dissect the neural pathways that control immunity and inflammation and enable the identification of novel approaches to therapy for kidney diseases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural pathways regulate immunity and inflammation via the inflammatory reflex and specific molecular targets can be modulated by stimulating neurons. Neuroimmunomodulation by nonpharmacological methods is emerging as a novel therapeutic strategy for inflammatory diseases, including kidney diseases and hypertension. Electrical stimulation of vagus neurons or treatment with pulsed ultrasound activates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) and protects mice from acute kidney injury (AKI). Direct innervation of the kidney, by afferent and efferent neurons, might have a role in modulating and responding to inflammation in various diseases, either locally or by providing feedback to regions of the central nervous system that are important in the inflammatory reflex pathway. Increased sympathetic drive to the kidney has a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, and selective modulation of neuroimmune interactions in the kidney could potentially be more effective for lowering blood pressure and treating inflammatory kidney diseases than renal denervation. Use of optogenetic tools for selective stimulation of specific neurons has enabled the identification of neural circuits in the brain that modulate kidney function via activation of the CAP. In this Review we discuss evidence for a role of neural circuits in the control of renal inflammation as well as the therapeutic potential of targeting these circuits in the settings of AKI, kidney fibrosis and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programmed Cell Death and Inflammation: Winter Is Coming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of an organism requires the assistance of an unlikely process: programmed cell death. Both development and the maintenance of homeostasis result in the production of superfluous cells that must eventually be disposed of. Furthermore, programmed cell death can also represent a defense mechanism; for example, by depriving pathogens of a replication niche. The responsibility of handling these dead cells falls on phagocytes of the immune system, which surveil their surroundings for dying or dead cells and efficiently clear them in a quiescent manner. This process, termed efferocytosis, depends on cooperation between the phagocyte and the dying cell. In this review we explore different types of programmed cell death and their impact on innate immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006938&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GP73 represses host innate immune response to promote virus replication by facilitating MAVS and TRAF6 degradation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Golgi protein 73 (GP73) is a serum biomarker for liver diseases and HCC. However, the mechanism underlying GP73 regulates HCV infection is largely unknown. Here, we revealed that GP73 acts as a novel negative regulator of host innate immunity to facilitate HCV infection. GP73 expression is activated and correlated with interferon-beta (IFN-β) production during HCV infection in patients&amp;rsquo; serum, primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and human hepatoma cells through mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular regulated protein kinase (MEK/ERK) pathway. Detailed studies revealed that HCV infection activates MAVS that in turn recruits TRAF6 via TRAF-interacting-motifs (TIMs), and TRAF6 subsequently directly recruits GP73 to MAVS via coiled-coil domain. After binding with MAVS and TRAF6, GP73 promotes MAVS and TRAF6 degradation through proteasome-dependent pathway. Moreover, GP73 attenuates IFN-β promoter, IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) promoter and down-regulates IFN-β, IFN-λ1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56), leading to the repression of host innate immunity. Finally, knock-down of GP73 down-regulates HCV infection and replication in Huh7-MAVSR cells and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), but such repression is rescued by GP73m4 (a mutant GP73 resists to GP73-shRNA#4) in Huh7-MAVSR cells, suggesting that GP73 facilitates HCV infection. Taken together, we demonstrated that GP73 acts as a negative regulator of innate immunity to facilitate HCV infection by interacting with MAVS/TRAF6 and promoting MAVS/TRAF6 degradation. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of HCV infection and pathogenesis, and suggests that GP73 is a new potential antiviral target in the prevention and treatment of HCV associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The transcriptional repressor Hes1 attenuates inflammation by regulating transcription elongation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the known regulatory mechanisms that curb inflammatory gene expression target pre-transcription-initiation steps, and evidence for post-initiation regulation of inflammatory gene expression remains scarce. We found that the transcriptional repressor Hes1 suppressed production of CXCL1, a chemokine that is crucial for recruiting neutrophils. Hes1 negatively regulated neutrophil recruitment in vivo in a manner that was dependent on macrophage-produced CXCL1, and it attenuated the severity of inflammatory arthritis. Mechanistically, inhibition of Cxcl1 expression by Hes1 did not involve modification of transcription initiation. Instead, Hes1 inhibited signal-induced recruitment of the positive transcription-elongation complex P-TEFb and thereby prevented phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II at Ser2 and productive elongation. Thus, our results identify Hes1 as a homeostatic suppressor of inflammatory responses that exerts its suppressive function by regulating transcription elongation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STAT3 signaling in immunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transcriptional regulator STAT3 has key roles in vertebrate development and mature tissue function including control of inflammation and immunity. Mutations in human STAT3 associate with diseases such as immunodeficiency, autoimmunity and cancer. Strikingly, however, either hyperactivation or inactivation of STAT3 results in human disease, indicating tightly regulated STAT3 function is central to health. Here, we attempt to summarize information on the numerous and distinct biological actions of STAT3, and highlight recent discoveries, with a specific focus on STAT3 function in the immune and hematopoietic systems. Our goal is to spur investigation on mechanisms by which aberrant STAT3 function drives human disease and novel approaches that might be used to modulate disease outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Cytomegalovirus Peptide-Specific Antibody Alters Natural Killer Cell Homeostasis and Is Shared in Several Autoimmune Diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human cytomegalovirus (hCMV), a ubiquitous beta-herpesvirus, has been associated with several autoimmune diseases. However, the direct role of hCMV in inducing autoimmune disorders remains unclear. Here we report the identification of an autoantibody that recognizes a group of peptides with a conserved motif matching the Pp150 protein of hCMV (anti-Pp150) and is shared among patients with various autoimmune diseases. Anti-Pp150 also recognizes the single-pass membrane protein CIP2A and induces the death of CD56(bright) NK cells, a natural killer cell subset whose expansion is correlated with autoimmune disease. Consistent with this finding, the percentage of circulating CD56(bright) NK cells is reduced in patients with several autoimmune diseases and negatively correlates with anti-Pp150 concentration. CD56(bright) NK cell death occurs via both antibody- and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Our findings reveal that a shared hCMV-induced autoantibody is involved in the decrease of CD56(bright) NK cells and may thus contribute to the onset of autoimmune disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inflammatory caspases are innate immune receptors for intracellular LPS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The murine caspase-11 non-canonical inflammasome responds to various bacterial infections. Caspase-11 activation-induced pyroptosis, in response to cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is critical for endotoxic shock in mice. The mechanism underlying cytosolic LPS sensing and the responsible pattern recognition receptor are unknown. Here we show that human monocytes, epithelial cells and keratinocytes undergo necrosis upon cytoplasmic delivery of LPS. LPS-induced cytotoxicity was mediated by human caspase-4 that could functionally complement murine caspase-11. Human caspase-4 and the mouse homologue caspase-11 (hereafter referred to as caspase-4/11) and also human caspase-5, directly bound to LPS and lipid A with high specificity and affinity. LPS associated with endogenous caspase-11 in pyroptotic cells. Insect-cell purified caspase-4/11 underwent oligomerization upon LPS binding, resulting in activation of the caspases. Underacylated lipid IVa and lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (LPS-RS) could bind to caspase-4/11 but failed to induce their oligomerization and activation. LPS binding was mediated by the CARD domain of the caspase. Binding-deficient CARD-domain point mutants did not respond to LPS with oligomerization or activation and failed to induce pyroptosis upon LPS electroporation or bacterial infections. The function of caspase-4/5/11 represents a new mode of pattern recognition in immunity and also an unprecedented means of caspase activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung-Targeted Transgene Expression of Nanocomplexed Ad5 Enhances Immune Response in the Presence of Preexisting Immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36714358/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vector has been widely applied in vaccine development targeting infectious diseases, such as Ebola virus disease and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the high prevalence of preexisting anti-vector immunity compromises the immunogenicity of Ad5-based vaccines. Thus, there is a substantial unmet need to minimize preexisting immunity while improving the insert-induced immunity of Ad5 vectors. Herein, we address this need by utilizing biocompatible nanoparticles to modulate Ad5-host interactions. We show that positively charged human serum albumin nanoparticles ((+)HSAnp), which are capable of forming a complex with Ad5, significantly increase the transgene expression of Ad5 in both coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor-positive and -negative cells. Furthermore, in charge- and dose-dependent manners, Ad5/(+)HSAnp complexes achieve robust (up to 227-fold higher) and long-term (up to 60 days) transgene expression in the lungs of mice following intranasal instillation. Importantly, in the presence of preexisting anti-Ad5 immunity, complexed Ad5-based Ebola and COVID-19 vaccines significantly enhance antigen-specific humoral response and mucosal immunity. These findings suggest that viral aggregation and charge modification could be leveraged to engineer enhanced viral vectors for vaccines and gene therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
