      <title>Release of extracellular superoxide dismutase into alveolar fluid protects against acute lung injury and inflammation in Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Oxidative stress and inflammation play crucial role in pathogenesis of ARDS. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is abundant in the lung and is important enzymatic defense against superoxide. Human single nucleotide polymorphism in matrix binding region of EC-SOD leads to substitution of arginine to glycine at position 213 (R213G) and results in release of EC-SOD into alveolar fluid, without affecting enzyme activity. We hypothesized that R213G EC-SOD variant protects against lung injury and inflammation via blockade of neutrophil-recruitment in infectious model of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. After inoculation with MRSA, WT mice had impaired integrity of alveolar-capillary barrier and increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), while infected mice expressing R213G EC-SOD variant maintained the integrity of alveolar-capillary interface and had attenuated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. MRSA-infected mice expressing R213G EC-SOD variant also had attenuated neutrophil numbers in BALF and decreased expression of neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1 by the alveolar epithelial ATII cells, compared to the infected WT group. The decreased neutrophil numbers in R213G mice were not due to increased rate of apoptosis. Mice expressing R213G variant had differential effect on neutrophil functionality, - the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) but not myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were attenuated in comparison to WT controls. Despite having the same bacterial load in the lung as WT controls, mice expressing R213G EC-SOD variant were protected from extrapulmonary dissemination of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microbiota-derived acetate enhances host antiviral response via NLRP3</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36746963/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic viral infections represent a major challenge to human health. Host immune responses to respiratory viruses are closely associated with microbiome and metabolism via the gut-lung axis. It has been known that host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) involves activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, however, mechanisms behind the protective function of NLRP3 are not fully known. Here we show that an isolated bacterial strain, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum NjM1, enriched in the gut microbiota of Nlrp3-/- mice, protects wild-type but not Nlrp3 deficient mice against IAV infection. This effect depends on the enhanced production of type I interferon (IFN-I) mediated by NjM1-derived acetate. Application of exogenous acetate reproduces the protective effect of NjM1. Mechanistically, NLRP3 bridges GPR43 and MAVS, and promotes the oligomerization and signalling of MAVS; while acetate enhances MAVS aggregation upon GPR43 engagement, leading to elevated IFN-I production. Thus, our data support a model of NLRP3 mediating enhanced induction of IFN-I via acetate-producing bacterium and suggest that the acetate-GPR43-NLRP3-MAVS-IFN-I signalling axis is a potential therapeutic target against respiratory viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung epithelial cell-derived C3 protects against pneumonia-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36735773/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lung protection by local complement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complement proteins are innate immune defense molecules that protect the host against pathogenic microorganisms. The activities of the C3 component of complement are mostly attributed to circulating C3 primarily synthesized by hepatocytes. Sahu and Ozantürk et al. used mouse models of conditional gene deletion to investigate the contribution of local C3 protein production in the lung to protecting the pulmonary mucosal surface from cell damage caused by &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; infection. Mice lacking C3 only in lung epithelial cells exhibited more pronounced acute lung injury than control mice even so circulating C3 levels were maintained at near-normal levels by maintenance of liver C3 production. These findings point to lung epithelial cell-intrinsic protective functions provided by C3 as an essential contributor to first-line defense against bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complement component C3 is a fundamental plasma protein for host defense, produced largely by the liver. However, recent work has demonstrated the critical importance of tissue-specific C3 expression in cell survival. Here, we analyzed the effects of local versus peripheral sources of C3 expression in a model of acute bacterial pneumonia induced by &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. Whereas mice with global C3 deficiency had severe pneumonia-induced lung injury, those deficient only in liver-derived C3 remained protected, comparable to wild-type mice. Human lung transcriptome analysis showed that secretory epithelial cells, such as club cells, express high levels of C3 mRNA. Mice with tamoxifen-induced C3 gene ablation from club cells in the lung had worse pulmonary injury compared with similarly treated controls, despite maintaining normal circulating C3 levels. Last, in both the mouse pneumonia model and cultured primary human airway epithelial cells, we showed that stress-induced death associated with C3 deficiency parallels that seen in Factor B deficiency rather than C3a receptor deficiency. Moreover, C3-mediated reduction in epithelial cell death requires alternative pathway component Factor B. Thus, our findings suggest that a pathway reliant on locally derived C3 and Factor B protects the lung mucosal barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nucleic DHX9 cooperates with STAT1 to transcribe interferon-stimulated genes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36735791/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA helicase DHX9 has been extensively characterized as a transcriptional regulator, which is consistent with its mostly nucleic localization. It is also involved in recognizing RNA viruses in the cytoplasm. However, there is no in vivo data to support the antiviral role of DHX9; meanwhile, as a nuclear protein, if and how nucleic DHX9 promotes antiviral immunity remains largely unknown. Here, we generated myeloid-specific and hepatocyte-specific DHX9 knockout mice and confirmed that DHX9 is crucial for host resistance to RNA virus infections in vivo. By additional knockout MAVS or STAT1 in DHX9-deficient mice, we demonstrated that nucleic DHX9 plays a positive role in regulating interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression downstream of type I interferon. Mechanistically, upon interferon stimulation, DHX9 is directly bound to STAT1 and recruits Pol II to the ISG promoter region to participate in STAT1-mediated transcription of ISGs. Collectively, these findings uncover an important role for nucleic DHX9 in antiviral immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Renal control of life-threatening malarial anemia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36735532/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron recycling prevents the development of anemia under homeostatic conditions. Whether iron recycling was co-opted as a defense strategy to prevent the development of anemia in response to infection is unclear. We find that in severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the onset of life-threatening anemia is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), irrespective of parasite load. Using a well-established experimental rodent model of malaria anemia, we identify a transcriptional response that endows renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) with the capacity to store and recycle iron during P. chabaudi chabaudi (Pcc) infection. This response encompasses the induction of ferroportin 1/SLC40A1, which exports iron from RPTECs and counteracts AKI while supporting compensatory erythropoiesis and preventing the onset of life-threatening malarial anemia. Iron recycling by myeloid cells is dispensable to this protective response, suggesting that RPTECs provide an iron-recycling salvage pathway that prevents the pathogenesis of life-threatening malarial anemia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A virus-induced circular RNA maintains latent infection of Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36724259/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are single-stranded, closed-circular RNAs, which bind to other RNAs or proteins to regulate their functions. The importance of circRNAs during virus infection has been largely elusive. Here, we identified that a circRNA, hsa_circ_0001400, is induced upon infection with various pathogenic viruses including Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) and controls viral and human gene expression so that infected human cells have less virus production but better cell growth. KSHV has two phases: latent and lytic cycle. circ_0001400 biases cells to the latent cycle during which viruses express only a limited number of genes to survive for the life of the host. Our results revealed a novel virus-host interaction via circRNAs to maintain latency after infection with an oncogenic virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in host-pathogen interactions; oncogenic viruses like Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) employ ncRNAs to establish a latent reservoir and persist for the life of the host. We previously reported that KSHV infection alters a novel class of RNA, circular RNAs (circRNAs). CircRNAs are alternative splicing isoforms and regulate gene expression, but their importance in infection is largely unknown. Here, we showed that a human circRNA, hsa_circ_0001400, is induced by various pathogenic viruses, namely KSHV, Epstein-Barr virus, and human cytomegalovirus. The induction of circRNAs including circ_0001400 by KSHV is co-transcriptionally regulated, likely at splicing. Consistently, screening for circ_0001400-interacting proteins identified a splicing factor, PNISR. Functional studies using infected primary endothelial cells revealed that circ_0001400 inhibits KSHV lytic transcription and virus production. Simultaneously, the circRNA promoted cell cycle, inhibited apoptosis, and induced immune genes. RNA-pull down assays identified transcripts interacting with circ_0001400, including TTI1, which is a component of the pro-growth mTOR complexes. We thus identified a circRNA that is pro-growth and anti-lytic replication. These results support a model in which KSHV induces circ_0001400 expression to maintain latency. Since circ_0001400 is induced by multiple viruses, this novel viral strategy may be widely employed by other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Candida albicans can foster gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation during HIV infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36722096/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt;) is a ubiquitous fungal commensal component of the human microbiota, and under certain circumstances, such as during an immunocompromised state, it may initiate different types of infection. Moreover, &lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt; continuously and reciprocally interacts with the host immune system as well as with other elements of the gut microbiota, thus contributing significantly to both gut homeostasis and host immunity. People living with HIV (PLWH), including those receiving antiretroviral therapy, are characterized by a depletion of CD4+ T-cells and dysbiosis in their gut. &lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt; colonization is frequent in PLWH, causing both a high prevalence and high morbidity. Gut barrier damage and elevated levels of microbial translocation are also fairly common in this population. Herein, we take a closer look at the reciprocity among &lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt;, gut microbiota, HIV, and the host immune system, thus throwing some light on this complex interplay.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 Protein Induces Global Proteomic Changes in ATII-Like Rat L2 Cells that are attenuated by Hyaluronan</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36719087/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impose a major impact on global health and economy since its identification in early 2020, causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, along with a growing number of variants, COVID-19 has led to 651,918,402 confirmed cases, and 6,656,601 deaths worldwide. Despite advances in our understanding of COVID19 pathogenesis, the precise mechanism by which SARS-CoV2 causes epithelial injury is incompletely understood. In this current study, robust application of global-discovery proteomics identified highly significant induced changes by the Spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the proteome of alveolar type II (ATII)-like Rat L2 cells that lack ACE2 receptors. Systems biology analysis revealed that the S1 induced proteomics changes were associated with three significant network hubs: E2F1, CREB1/ RelA, and ROCK2/ RhoA. We also found that pre-treatment of L2 cells with High Molecular Weight Hyaluronan (HMW-HA), greatly attenuated the S1 effects on the proteome. Western blotting analysis and cell cycle measurements confirmed the S1-upregulation of E2F1 and ROCK2/RhoA in L2 cells and the protective effects of HMW-HA. Taken as a whole, our studies revealed profound and novel biological changes that contribute to our current understanding of both S1 and Hyaluronan biology. This data shows that the S1 protein may contribute to epithelial injury induced by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, our work supports the potential benefit of HMW-HA in ameliorating SARS CoV2 induced cell injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Innate Checkpoint Determines Immune Dysregulation and Immunopathology during Pulmonary Murine Coronavirus Infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallmarks of life-threatening, coronavirus-induced disease include dysregulated antiviral immunity and immunopathological tissue injury. Nevertheless, the sampling of symptomatic patients overlooks the initial inflammatory sequela culminating in severe coronavirus-induced disease, leaving a fundamental gap in our understanding of the early mechanisms regulating anticoronavirus immunity and preservation of tissue integrity. In this study, we delineate the innate regulators controlling pulmonary infection using a natural mouse coronavirus. Within hours of infection, the cellular landscape of the lung was transcriptionally remodeled altering host metabolism, protein synthesis, and macrophage maturation. Genetic perturbation revealed that these transcriptional programs were type I IFN dependent and critically controlled both host cell survival and viral spread. Unrestricted viral replication overshooting protective IFN responses culminated in increased IL-1β and alarmin production and triggered compensatory neutrophilia, interstitial inflammation, and vascular injury. Thus, type I IFNs critically regulate early viral burden, which serves as an innate checkpoint determining the trajectory of coronavirus dissemination and immunopathology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging and re-emerging respiratory viral infections pose a tremendous threat to human society, as exemplified by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Upon viral invasion of the respiratory tract, the host initiates coordinated innate and adaptive immune responses to defend against the virus and to promote repair of the damaged tissue. However, dysregulated host immunity can also cause acute morbidity, hamper lung regeneration, and/or lead to chronic tissue sequelae. Here, we review our current knowledge of the immune mechanisms regulating antiviral protection, host pathogenesis, inflammation resolution, and lung regeneration following respiratory viral infections, mainly using influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infections as examples. We hope that this review sheds light on future research directions to elucidate the cellular and molecular cross talk regulating host recovery and to pave the way to the development of pro-repair therapeutics to augment lung regeneration following viral injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) frequently colonizes the swine upper respiratory tract and can cause Streptococcal disease in swine with clinical manifestations of pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia. Previously, we have shown that vimentin, a kind of intermediate filament protein, is involved in the penetration of SS2 through the tracheal epithelial barrier. The initiation of invasive disease is closely related to SS2-induced excessive local inflammation; however, the role of vimentin in airway epithelial inflammation remains unclear. Here, we show that vimentin deficient mice exhibit attenuated lung injury, diminished production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and the IL-8 homolog, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), and substantially reduced neutrophils in the lungs following intranasal infection with SS2. We also found that swine tracheal epithelial cells (STEC) without vimentin show decreased transcription of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8. SS2 infection caused reassembly of vimentin in STEC, and pharmacological disruption of vimentin filaments prevented the transcription of those proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, deficiency of vimentin failed to increase the transcription of nucleotide oligomerization domain protein 2 (NOD2), which is known to interact with vimentin, and the phosphorylation of NF-κB protein p65. This study provides insights into how vimentin promotes excessive airway inflammation, thereby exacerbating airway injury and SS2-induced systemic infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spermine enhances antiviral and anticancer responses by stabilizing DNA binding with the DNA sensor cGAS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-nonself discrimination is vital for the immune system to mount responses against pathogens while maintaining tolerance toward the host and innocuous commensals during homeostasis. Here, we investigated how indiscriminate DNA sensors, such as cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), make this self-nonself distinction. Screening of a small-molecule library revealed that spermine, a well-known DNA condenser associated with viral DNA, markedly elevates cGAS activation. Mechanistically, spermine condenses DNA to enhance and stabilize cGAS-DNA binding, optimizing cGAS and downstream antiviral signaling. Spermine promotes condensation of viral, but not host nucleosome, DNA. Deletion of viral DNA-associated spermine, by propagating virus in spermine-deficient cells, reduced cGAS activation. Spermine depletion subsequently attenuated cGAS-mediated antiviral and anticancer immunity. Collectively, our results reveal a pathogenic DNA-associated molecular pattern that facilitates nonself recognition, linking metabolism and pathogen recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD-NTase family member MB21D2 promotes cGAS-mediated antiviral and antitumor immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36681781/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) family members are immune sensors that synthesize diverse nucleotide signals to initiate antiviral response in bacteria and animals. As a founding member of CD-NTase enzyme, cGAS has been identified as a key sensor for cytoplasmic DNA and type I interferons (IFNs) signaling in metazoan. However, the functions of other metazoan CD-NTases remain enigmatic. Here, we showed that Mab-21 domain-containing protein 2 (MB21D2), another member of the CD-NTase family, plays a positive role in modulating the cGAS-STING signaling in myeloid cells. Deficiency of MB21D2 in THP-1 cells or mice macrophages led to impaired production of type I interferon upon DNA stimulation. Consistently, &lt;em&gt;Mb21d2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice showed more susceptible to infection with DNA virus and faster growth of melanoma, compared to its counterparts. Mechanistically, MB21D2 specially bound with the N-terminal of cGAS, facilitated its liquid phase condensation and DNA-binding activity, leading to the enhanced production of cGAMP and subsequent IFN-β production. Thus, our findings unveiled that the CD-NTase family member MB21D2 contributes to host antiviral and antitumor responses by enhancing cGAS activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immunological and metabolic characteristics of the Omicron variants infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2, primarily authenticated in November 2021 in South Africa, has initiated the 5th wave of global pandemics. Here, we systemically examined immunological and metabolic characteristics of Omicron variants infection. We found Omicron resisted to neutralizing antibody targeting receptor binding domain (RBD) of wildtype SARS-CoV-2. Omicron could hardly be neutralized by sera of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescents infected with the Delta variant. Through mass spectrometry on MHC-bound peptidomes, we found that the spike protein of the Omicron variants could generate additional CD8 + T cell epitopes, compared with Delta. These epitopes could induce robust CD8 + T cell responses. Moreover, we found booster vaccination increased the cross-memory CD8 + T cell responses against Omicron. Metabolic regulome analysis of Omicron-specific T cell showed a metabolic profile that promoted the response of memory T cells. Consistently, a greater fraction of memory CD8 + T cells existed in Omicron stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, CD147 was also a receptor for the Omicron variants, and CD147 antibody inhibited infection of Omicron. CD147-mediated Omicron infection in a human CD147 transgenic mouse model induced exudative alveolar pneumonia. Taken together, our data suggested that vaccination booster and receptor blocking antibody are two effective strategies against Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Altered host protease determinants for SARS-CoV-2 Omicron</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requires proteolytic cleavage of the viral spike protein. While the role of the host transmembrane protease serine 2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection is widely recognized, the involvement of other proteases capable of facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry remains incompletely explored. Here, we show that multiple members from the membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase (MT-MMP) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase families can mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Inhibition of MT-MMPs significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that MT-MMPs can cleave SARS-CoV-2 spike and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and facilitate spike-mediated fusion. We further demonstrate that Omicron BA.1 has an increased efficiency on MT-MMP usage, while an altered efficiency on transmembrane serine protease usage for virus entry compared with that of ancestral SARS-CoV-2. These results reveal additional protease determinants for SARS-CoV-2 infection and enhance our understanding on the biology of coronavirus entry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Glycosyltransferase Extl1 promotes CCR7-mediated dendritic cell migration to restrain infection and autoimmunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CCR7L-upregulated Extl1 promotes CCR7-triggered DC migration via HSPG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extl1 mediates DC HSPG production via the glycosyltransferase domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extl1/HSPG axis enhances DC CCR7 expression and internalization by inhibiting C1q&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extl1 balances T cell-mediated immunity and tolerance by strengthening DC migration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CCR7-triggered DC migration toward draining lymph nodes is critical for the initiation of protective immunity and maintenance of immune tolerance. How to promote CCR7-mediated DC migration to determine T cell responses under inflammatory and homeostatic conditions remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the Extl1 (Exostosin like glycosyltransferase 1) promotes CCR7-triggered DC migration in a heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG)-dependent manner. Mechanistically, Extl1 mediates HSPG production via its glycosyltransferase domain to inhibit C1q expression. Extl1/HSPG axis relieves C1q-mediated restriction of CCR7 surface expression and internalization, and thus enhances CCR7-dependent migratory signaling activation. Consequently, Extl1 is required for DC-mediated Th1 and Th17 responses in immune defense against bacterial infection and for Treg cell development in the prevention of autoimmunity. Our study adds mechanistic insights to the regulation of CCR7-triggered DC migration in immunity and tolerance and provides a potential target for the treatment of infectious and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Type I interferon/STAT1 signaling regulates UBE2M-mediated antiviral innate immunity in a negative feedback manner</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UBE2M inhibits STUB1-mediated RIG-I degradation to resist RNA virus infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-I/STAT1 negatively regulates UBE2M-induced antiviral immunity via TRIM21&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mEVs/TRIM21-ΔRING are promising antiviral reagents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling is central to inducing antiviral innate immunity. However, the mechanisms for IFN-I signaling self-regulation are still largely unknown. Here, we report that RNA virus-infected macrophages with UBE2M deficiency produced decreased IFN-I expression in a RIG-I-dependent manner, causing an aggravated viral infection. Mechanistically, UBE2M inhibits RIG-I degradation by preventing the interaction of RIG-I and E3 ligase STUB1, resulting in antiviral IFN-I signaling activation. Simultaneously, IFN-I signaling-activated STAT1 facilitates the transcription of &lt;em&gt;Trim21&lt;/em&gt;, leading to increased UBE2M degradation and blunted antiviral immunity. Translationally, oral administration of milk-derived extracellular vesicles containing RING domain-truncated TRIM21 (TRIM21-ΔRING) lacking E3 ligase activity efficiently transfers TRIM21-ΔRING into macrophages. TRIM21-ΔRING suppresses UBE2M degradation by competitively binding to UBE2M with TRIM21, thereby enhancing antiviral immunity. Overall, we reveal a negative feedback loop of IFN-I signaling and develop a reagent to improve innate immunity against RNA viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interactomics: dozens of viruses, co-evolving with humans, including the influenza A virus, may actively distort human ageing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some viruses (e.g. HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2) have been experimentally proposed to accelerate features of human ageing and of cellular senescence. These observations, along with evolutionary considerations on viral fitness, raised the more general puzzling hypothesis that, beyond documented sources in human genetics, ageing in our species may also depend on virally-encoded interactions distorting our ageing to the benefits of diverse viruses. Accordingly, we designed systematic network-based analyses of the human and viral protein interactomes, which unraveled dozens of viruses encoding proteins experimentally demonstrated to interact with proteins from pathways associated with human ageing, including cellular senescence. We further corroborated our predictions that specific viruses interfere with human ageing using published experimental evidence and transcriptomic data; identifying influenza A virus (subtype H1N1) as a major candidate age-distorter, notably through manipulation of cellular senescence. By providing original evidence that viruses may convergently contribute to the evolution of numerous age-associated pathways through co-evolution, our network- and bipartite network-based methodology supports an ecosystemic study of ageing, also searching for genetic causes of ageing outside a focal ageing species. Our findings, predicting age-distorters and targets for anti-ageing therapies amongst human viruses, could have fundamental and practical implications for evolutionary biology, ageing study, virology, medicine and demography.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger strong inflammatory responses and cause severe lung damage in COVID-19 patients with critical illness. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the infection induces excessive inflammatory responses are not fully understood. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in the formation of viral Z-RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells and thereby activates the ZBP1-RIPK3 pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of RIPK3 by GSK872 or genetic deletion of MLKL reduced SARS-CoV-2-induced IL-1β release. ZBP1 or RIPK3 deficiency leads to reduced production of both inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during SARS-CoV-2 infection both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, deletion of ZBP1 or RIPK3 alleviated SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced immune cell infiltration and lung damage in infected mouse models. These results suggest that the ZBP1-RIPK3 pathway plays a critical role in SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses and lung damage. Our study provides novel insights into how SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers inflammatory responses and lung pathology, and implicates the therapeutic potential of targeting ZBP1-RIPK3 axis in treating COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells is initiated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to its cell-surface receptor ACE2. We conducted a targeted CRISPRi screen to uncover druggable pathways controlling Spike protein binding to human cells. Here we show that the protein BRD2 is required for ACE2 transcription in human lung epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and BRD2 inhibitors currently evaluated in clinical trials potently block endogenous ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells, including those of human nasal epithelia. Moreover, pharmacological BRD2 inhibition with the drug ABBV-744 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Syrian hamsters. We also found that BRD2 controls transcription of several other genes induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the interferon response, which in turn regulates the antiviral response. Together, our results pinpoint BRD2 as a potent and essential regulator of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the potential of BRD2 as a therapeutic target for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GATA4 prevents small intestinal inflammation by restricting bacterial colonization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GATA4 regulates bacterial colonization in part by regulating IgA and retinol metabolism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GATA4 deficiency, SFB, and &lt;em&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/em&gt; synergize to drive immunopathology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Th17 immunity is found in celiac patients with GATA4 deficiency and &lt;em&gt;Actinobacillus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is growing recognition that regionalization of bacterial colonization and immunity along the intestinal tract has an important role in health and disease. Yet, the mechanisms underlying intestinal regionalization and its dysregulation in disease are not well understood. This study found that regional epithelial expression of the transcription factor GATA4 controls bacterial colonization and inflammatory tissue immunity in the proximal small intestine by regulating retinol metabolism and luminal IgA. Furthermore, in mice without jejunal GATA4 expression, the commensal segmented filamentous bacteria promoted pathogenic inflammatory immune responses that disrupted barrier function and increased mortality upon &lt;em&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/em&gt; infection. In celiac disease patients, low GATA4 expression was associated with metabolic alterations, mucosal Actinobacillus, and increased IL-17 immunity. Taken together, these results reveal broad impacts of GATA4-regulated intestinal regionalization on bacterial colonization and tissue immunity, highlighting an elaborate interdependence of intestinal metabolism, immunity, and microbiota in homeostasis and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; (Mtb) is the pathogenic agent of tuberculosis (TB). Intracellular survival plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Mtb, a process that depends on an array of virulence factors for Mtb to colonize and proliferate within a host. Reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNS and ROS) are among the most effective antimycobacterial molecules generated by the host during infection. However, Mtb has evolved a number of proteins and enzymes to detoxify ROS and RNS. Secretory protein Rv1324, as a possible thioredoxin, might also have oxidoreductase activity against ROS and RNS during Mtb infection, and it is a potential virulence factor of Mtb. In this study, we investigated the biochemical properties of Mtb Rv1324 and its role in mycobacterial survival and virulence. The results showed that the Rv1324 protein had antioxidant activity and increased the survival of &lt;em&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/em&gt; that was exposed to ROS and RNS. In addition, Rv1324 enhanced the colonization ability of &lt;em&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/em&gt; in the lungs of mice. Further, mice infected with &lt;em&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/em&gt; harboring Rv1324 exhibited pathological injury and inflammation in the lung, which was mediated by ferroptosis. In summary, this study advances our understanding of the mechanisms of mycobacterial survival and pathogenesis, and it reveals a novel target for TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intracellular survival of &lt;em&gt;M. tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; (Mtb) plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis, which depends on various Mtb oxidoreductases that are resistant to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) that are generated by the host during Mtb infection. Secretory protein Rv1324 is a potential virulence factor of Mtb and is a possible thioredoxin that has oxidoreductase activity against ROS and RNS during Mtb infection. We investigated the biochemical properties of Mtb Rv1324 and its role in mycobacterial survival and virulence. It was confirmed that the Rv1324 protein had antioxidant activity and an increased mycobacterial resistance to ROS and RNS. In addition, Rv1324 enhanced mycobacterial persistence and induced pathological injury and inflammation in the lungs of mice by activating ferroptosis. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms of mycobacterial survival and pathogenesis, and it reveals a novel target for TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and nucleotide analog GS-441524 conjugates with potent in vivo efficacy against coronaviruses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36706621/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ibuprofen and nucleotide analog GS-441524 conjugates (ATV041) were designed and demonstrated broad anti-CoV activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATV041 successfully improved the oral PK profile and tissue distribution relative to GS-441524 which has poor oral PK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oral ATV041 reduced viral loads, alleviated tissue damage and virus-induced inflammation in MHV-A59 mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a broad range of hosts, including humans and various animals, with a tendency to cross the species barrier, causing severe harm to human society and fostering the need for effective anti-coronaviral drugs. GS-441524 is a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside with potent anti-CoVs activities. However, its application is limited by poor oral bioavailability. Herein, we designed and synthesized several conjugates via covalently binding NSAIDs to 5&amp;rsquo;-OH of GS-441524 through ester bonds. The ibuprofen conjugate, ATV041, exhibited potent in vitro anti-coronaviral efficacy against four zoonotic coronaviruses in the alpha- and beta-genera. Oral-dosed ATV041 resulted in favorable bioavailability and rapid tissue distribution of GS-441524 and ibuprofen. In MHV-A59 infected mice, ATV041 dose-dependently decreased viral RNA replication and significantly reduced the proinflammatory cytokines in the liver and the lung at 3 dpi. As a result, the MHV-A59-induced lung and liver inflammatory injury was significantly alleviated. Taken together, this work provides a novel drug conjugate strategy to improve oral PK and offers a potent anti-coronaviral lead compound for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Severe respiratory viral infections: T-cell functions diverging from immunity to inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36635162/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon respiratory viral infection, a robust innate immune response can efficiently drive adaptive immunity whereby virus-specific T cells are activated. Meanwhile, memory T cells nonspecific to the virus can also be primed by proinflammatory cytokines and complement proteins, a process termed ‘bystander activation’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exaggerated production of proinflammatory cytokines from prolonged infection can skew the balance from virus-specific T-cell activation to nonspecific bystander T-cell activation which can significantly contribute to unresolved inflammation and cause tissue damage and severe disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preventive and therapeutic strategies that suppress viral replication or inhibit proinflammatory signals can reinstate the balance of virus-specific activation and bystander activation of T cells. Prevention of T-cell-mediated pathology and tissue damage will support efficient immunity and recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A virus (IAV) trigger distinct clinical outcomes defined by immunity-based viral clearance or disease associated with exaggerated and prolonged inflammation. The important role of T cells in shaping both antiviral immunity and inflammation has revived interest in understanding the host-pathogen interactions that lead to the diverse functions of T cells in respiratory viral infections. Inborn deficiencies and acquired insufficiency in immunity can prolong infection and shift the immune response towards exacerbated inflammation, which results from persistent innate immune activation and bystander T-cell activation that is nonspecific to the pathogen but is often driven by cytokines. This review discusses how virus variants, exposure doses, routes of infection, host genetics, and immune history can modulate the activation and function of T cells, thus influencing clinical outcomes. Knowledge of virus-host interaction can inform strategies to prevent immune dysfunction in respiratory viral infection and help in the treatment of associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles mediate antibody-resistant transmission of SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36609376/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic. Antibody resistance dampens neutralizing antibody therapy and threatens current global Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine campaigns. In addition to the emergence of resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants, little is known about how SARS-CoV-2 evades antibodies. Here, we report a novel mechanism of extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 to escape from neutralizing antibodies. These EVs, initially observed in SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein-expressing cells, are secreted by various SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, including Vero E6, Calu-3, and HPAEpiC cells, undergoing infection-induced pyroptosis. Various SARS-CoV-2-infected cells produce similar EVs characterized by extra-large sizes (1.6-9.5 μm in diameter, average diameter &amp;gt; 4.2 μm) much larger than previously reported virus-generated vesicles. Transmission electron microscopy analysis and plaque assay reveal that these SARS-CoV-2-induced EVs contain large amounts of live virus particles. In particular, the vesicle-cloaked SARS-CoV-2 virus is resistant to neutralizing antibodies and able to reinfect naïve cells independent of the reported receptors and cofactors. Consistently, the constructed 3D images show that intact EVs could be taken up by recipient cells directly, supporting vesicle-mediated cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of receptor-independent SARS-CoV-2 infection via cell-to-cell transmission, provide new insights into antibody resistance of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest potential targets for future antiviral therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OASL phase condensation induces amyloid-like fibrillation of RIPK3 to promote virus-induced necroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36604592/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIPK3-ZBP1-MLKL-mediated necroptosis is a proinflammatory cell death process that is crucial for antiviral host defence. RIPK3 self-oligomerization and autophosphorylation are prerequisites for executing necroptosis, yet the underlying mechanism of virus-induced RIPK3 activation remains elusive. Interferon-inducible 2&amp;rsquo;-5&amp;rsquo; oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) protein is devoid of enzymatic function but displays potent antiviral activity. Here we describe a role of OASL as a virus-induced necroptosis promoter that scaffolds the RIPK3-ZBP1 non-canonical necrosome via liquid-like phase condensation. This liquid-like platform of OASL recruits RIPK3 and ZBP1 via protein-protein interactions to provide spatial segregation for RIPK3 nucleation. This process facilitates the amyloid-like fibril formation and activation of RIPK3 and thereby MLKL phosphorylation for necroptosis. Mice deficient in Oasl1 exhibit severely impaired necroptosis and attenuated inflammation after viral infection, resulting in uncontrolled viral dissemination and lethality. Our study demonstrates an interferon-induced innate response whereby OASL scaffolds RIPK3-ZBP1 assembly via its phase-separated liquid droplets to facilitate necroptosis-mediated antiviral immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>β-adrenoreceptor-triggered PKA activation negatively regulates the innate antiviral response</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon viral infection, cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors detect viral nucleic acids and activate the adaptor protein VISA/MAVS- or MITA/STING-mediated innate antiviral response. Whether and how the innate antiviral response is regulated by neuronal endocrine functions is unclear. Here, we show that viral infection reduced the serum levels of the β-adrenergic hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine as well as the cellular levels of their receptors ADRB1 and ADRB2. We further show that an increase in epinephrine/norepinephrine level inhibited the innate antiviral response in an ADRB1-/2-dependent manner. Mechanistically, epinephrine/norepinephrine stimulation activated the downstream kinase PKA, which catalyzed the phosphorylation of MITA at S241, S243 and T263, inhibiting MITA activation and suppressing the innate immune response to DNA virus. In addition, phosphorylation of VISA at T54 by PKA antagonized the innate immune response to RNA virus. These findings reveal the regulatory mechanisms of innate antiviral responses by epinephrine/norepinephrine and provide a possible explanation for increased host susceptibility to viral infection in stressful and anxiety-promoting situations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Commensal microbiome promotes hair follicle regeneration by inducing keratinocyte HIF-1α signaling and glutamine metabolism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue injury induces metabolic changes in stem cells, which likely modulate regeneration. Using a model of organ regeneration called wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN), we identified skin-resident bacteria as key modulators of keratinocyte metabolism, demonstrating a positive correlation between bacterial load, glutamine metabolism, and regeneration. Specifically, through comprehensive multiomic analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing in murine skin, we show that bacterially induced hypoxia drives increased glutamine metabolism in keratinocytes with attendant enhancement of skin and hair follicle regeneration. In human skin wounds, topical broad-spectrum antibiotics inhibit glutamine production and are partially responsible for reduced healing. These findings reveal a conserved and coherent physiologic context in which bacterially induced metabolic changes improve the tolerance of stem cells to damage and enhance regenerative capacity. This unexpected proregenerative modulation of metabolism by the skin microbiome in both mice and humans suggests important methods for enhancing regeneration after injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic fungi have emerged as significant causes of infectious morbidity and death in patients with acquired immunodeficiency conditions such as HIV/AIDS and following receipt of chemotherapy, immunosuppressive agents or targeted biologics for neoplastic or autoimmune diseases, or transplants for end organ failure. Furthermore, in recent years, the spread of multidrug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt; has caused life-threatening outbreaks in health-care facilities worldwide and raised serious concerns for global public health. Rapid progress in the discovery and functional characterization of inborn errors of immunity that predispose to fungal disease and the development of clinically relevant animal models have enhanced our understanding of fungal recognition and effector pathways and adaptive immune responses. In this Review, we synthesize our current understanding of the cellular and molecular determinants of mammalian antifungal immunity, focusing on observations that show promise for informing risk stratification, prognosis, prophylaxis and therapies to combat life-threatening fungal infections in vulnerable patient populations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metabolic enzyme UAP1 mediates IRF3 pyrophosphorylation to facilitate innate immune response</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36603579/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UAP1 is a positive regulator of type I interferon signaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UAP1 catalyzes IRF3 pyrophosphorylation at serine 386&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UAP1 pyrophosphorylates IRF3 at S386 to promote antiviral responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins are crucial to guarantee the proper biological functions in immune responses. Although protein phosphorylation has been extensively studied, our current knowledge of protein pyrophosphorylation, which occurs based on phosphorylation, is very limited. Protein pyrophosphorylation is originally considered to be a non-enzymatic process, and its function in immune signaling is unknown. Here, we identify a metabolic enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1), as a pyrophosphorylase for protein serine pyrophosphorylation, by catalyzing the pyrophosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) at serine (Ser) 386 to promote robust type I interferon (IFN) responses. Uap1 deficiency significantly impairs the activation of both DNA- and RNA-viruse-induced type I IFN pathways, and the Uap1-deficient mice are highly susceptible to lethal viral infection. Our findings demonstrate the function of protein pyrophosphorylation in the regulation of antiviral responses and provide insights into the crosstalk between metabolism and innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rabies virus P protein binds to TBK1 and interferes with the formation of innate immunity-related liquid condensates</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon interferon-inducing signals, TBK1, NAP1, and SINTBAD form liquid condensates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rabies virus phosphoprotein P binds TBK1 to inhibit interferon induction pathways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A change of serine 179 to proline abolishes the P-inhibitory activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutations of TBK1 phosphorylation sites abolish P binding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses must overcome the interferon-mediated antiviral response to replicate and propagate into their host. Rabies virus (RABV) phosphoprotein P is known to inhibit interferon induction. Here, using a global mass spectrometry approach, we show that RABV P binds to TBK1, a kinase located at the crossroads of many interferon induction pathways, resulting in innate immunity inhibition. Mutations of TBK1 phosphorylation sites abolish P binding. Importantly, we demonstrate that upon RABV infection or detection of dsRNA by innate immunity sensors, TBK1 and its adaptor proteins NAP1 and SINTBAD form dynamic cytoplasmic condensates that have liquid properties. These condensates can form larger aggregates having ring-like structures in which NAP1 and TBK1 exhibit locally restricted movement. P binding to TBK1 interferes with the formation of these structures. This work demonstrates that proteins of the signaling pathway leading to interferon induction transiently form liquid organelles that can be targeted by viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Maresin 1-LGR6 axis decreases respiratory syncytial virus-induced lung inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution of infection is an active process with specific molecular and cellular mechanisms that temper inflammation and enhance pathogen clearance. Here, the specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) Maresin 1 (MaR1) inhibited respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced inflammation. inlerleukin-13 production from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC) and CD4 T helper type 2 cells was decreased by exogenous MaR1. In addition, MaR1 increased amphiregulin production and decreased RSV viral transcripts to promote resolution. MaR1 also promoted interferon-β production in mouse lung tissues and also in pediatric lung slices. MaR1 significantly inhibited the RSV-triggered aberrant inflammatory phenotype in FoxP3-expressing Tregs. The receptor for MaR1, leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6), was constitutively expressed on Tregs. Following RSV infection, mice lacking Lgr6 had exacerbated type 2 immune responses with an increased viral burden and blunted responses to MaR1. Together, these findings have uncovered a multi-pronged protective signaling axis for MaR1-Lgr6, improving Tregs&amp;rsquo;s suppressive function and upregulating host antiviral genes resulting in decreased viral burden and pathogen-mediated inflammation, ultimately promoting restoration of airway mucosal homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pathogenicity and virulence of human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) in oncogenesis: adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive malignancy of CD4+ T lymphocytes caused by human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infection. HTLV-1 was brought to the World Health Organization (WHO) and researchers to address its impact on global public health, oncogenicity, and deterioration of the host immune system toward autoimmunity. In a minority of the infected population (3-5%), it can induce inflammatory networks toward HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), or hijacking the infected CD4+ T lymphocytes into T regulatory subpopulation, stimulating anti-inflammatory signaling networks, and prompting ATLL development. This review critically discusses the complex signaling networks in ATLL pathogenesis during virus-host interactions for better interpretation of oncogenicity and introduces the main candidates in the pathogenesis of ATLL. At least two viral factors, HTLV-1 trans-activator protein (TAX) and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), are implicated in ATLL manifestation, interacting with host responses and deregulating cell signaling in favor of infected cell survival and virus dissemination. Such molecules can be used as potential novel biomarkers for ATLL prognosis or targets for therapy. Moreover, the challenging aspects of HTLV-1 oncogenesis introduced in this review could open new venues for further studies on acute leukemia pathogenesis. These features can aid in the discovery of effective immunotherapies when reversing the gene expression profile toward appropriate immune responses gradually becomes attainable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The nucleoprotein of influenza A virus inhibits the innate immune response by inducing mitophagy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitophagy is a form of autophagy that plays a key role in maintaining the homeostasis of functional mitochondria in the cell. Viruses have evolved various strategies to manipulate mitophagy to escape host immune responses and promote virus replication. In this study, the nucleoprotein (NP) of H1N1 virus (PR8 strain) was identified as a regulator of mitophagy. We revealed that NP-mediated mitophagy leads to the degradation of the mitochondria-anchored protein MAVS, thereby blocking MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling and promoting virus replication. The NP-mediated mitophagy is dependent on the interaction of NP with MAVS and the cargo receptor TOLLIP. Moreover, Y313 of NP is a key residue for the MAVS-NP interaction and NP-mediated mitophagy. The NPY313F mutation significantly attenuates the virus-induced mitophagy and the virus replication in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings uncover a novel mechanism by which the NP of influenza virus induces mitophagy to attenuate innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tripterin liposome relieves severe acute respiratory syndrome as a potent COVID-19 treatment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 15-30% of patients are likely to develop COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are still few effective and well-understood therapies available. Novel variants and short-lasting immunity are posing challenges to vaccine efficacy, so finding antiviral and antiinflammatory treatments remains crucial. Here, tripterin (TP), a traditional Chinese medicine, was encapsulated into liposome (TP lipo) to investigate its antiviral and antiinflammatory effects in severe COVID-19. By using two severe COVID-19 models in human ACE2-transgenic (hACE2) mice, an analysis of TP lipo&amp;rsquo;s effects on pulmonary immune responses was conducted. Pulmonary pathological alterations and viral burden were reduced by TP lipo treatment. TP lipo inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication and hyperinflammation in infected cells and mice, two crucial events in severe COVID-19 pathophysiology, it is a promising drug candidate to treat SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neural-Cell-Intrinsic NF-κB Signaling Enhances Reovirus Virulence</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36541803/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathological effects of apoptosis associated with viral infections of the central nervous system are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Reovirus is a neurotropic virus that causes apoptosis in neurons, leading to lethal encephalitis in newborn mice. Reovirus-induced encephalitis is diminished in mice with germ line ablation of NF-κB subunit p50. It is not known whether the proapoptotic function of NF-κB is mediated by neural-cell-intrinsic (neural-intrinsic) processes, NF-κB-regulated cytokine production by inflammatory cells, or a combination of both. To determine the contribution of cell type-specific NF-κB signaling in reovirus-induced neuronal injury, we established mice that lack NF-κB p65 expression in neural cells using the &lt;em&gt;Cre/loxP&lt;/em&gt; recombination system. Following intracranial inoculation of reovirus, 50% of wild-type (WT) mice succumbed to infection, whereas more than 90% of mice lacking neural cell NF-κB p65 (Nsp65&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) survived. While viral loads in brains of WT and Nsp65&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice were comparable, histological analysis revealed that reovirus antigen-positive areas in the brains of WT mice displayed increased immunoreactivity for cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, relative to Nsp65&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. These data suggest that neural-intrinsic NF-κB-dependent factors are essential mediators of reovirus neurovirulence. RNA sequencing analysis of reovirus-infected brain cortices of WT and Nsp65&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice suggests that NF-κB activation in neuronal cells upregulates genes involved in innate immunity, inflammation, and cell death following reovirus infection. A better understanding of the contribution of cell type-specific NF-κB-dependent signaling to viral neuropathogenesis could inform development of new therapeutics that target and protect highly vulnerable cell populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral encephalitis contributes to illness and death in children and adults worldwide and has limited treatment options. Identifying common host factors upregulated by neurotropic viruses can enhance an understanding of virus-induced neuropathogenesis and aid in development of therapeutics. Although many neurotropic viruses activate NF-κB during infection, mechanisms by which NF-κB regulates viral neuropathogenesis and contributes to viral encephalitis are not well understood. We established mice in which NF-κB expression is ablated in neural tissue to study the function of NF-κB in reovirus neurovirulence and identify genes activated by NF-κB in response to reovirus infection in the central nervous system. Encephalitis following reovirus infection was dampened in mice lacking neural cell NF-κB. Reovirus induced a chemokine profile in the brain that was dependent on NF-κB signaling and was similar to chemokine profiles elicited by other neurotropic viruses. These data suggest common underlying mechanisms of encephalitis caused by neurotropic viruses and potentially shared therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Persistent post-COVID-19 smell loss is associated with immune cell infiltration and altered gene expression in olfactory epithelium</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36542694/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 causes profound changes in the sense of smell, including total smell loss. Although these alterations are often transient, many patients with COVID-19 exhibit olfactory dysfunction that lasts months to years. Although animal and human autopsy studies have suggested mechanisms driving acute anosmia, it remains unclear how SARS-CoV-2 causes persistent smell loss in a subset of patients. To address this question, we analyzed olfactory epithelial samples collected from 24 biopsies, including from nine patients with objectively quantified long-term smell loss after COVID-19. This biopsy-based approach revealed a diffuse infiltrate of T cells expressing interferon-γ and a shift in myeloid cell population composition, including enrichment of CD207+ dendritic cells and depletion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Despite the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA or protein, gene expression in the barrier supporting cells of the olfactory epithelium, termed sustentacular cells, appeared to reflect a response to ongoing inflammatory signaling, which was accompanied by a reduction in the number of olfactory sensory neurons relative to olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells. These findings indicate that T cell-mediated inflammation persists in the olfactory epithelium long after SARS-CoV-2 has been eliminated from the tissue, suggesting a mechanism for long-term post-COVID-19 smell loss.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Degradation of HDAC10 by autophagy promotes IRF3-mediated antiviral innate immune responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36538592/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in immunity and inflammation. Through functional screening, we identified HDAC10 as an inhibitor of the type I interferon (IFN) response mediated by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). HDAC10 abundance was decreased in mouse macrophages in response to innate immune stimuli and was reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared with that in PBMCs from healthy donors. Deficiency in HDAC10 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in mice promoted the expression of genes encoding type I IFNs and of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), leading to enhanced antiviral responses in vitro and in vivo. HDAC10 bound in a deacetylase-independent manner to IRF3 in uninfected cells to inhibit the phosphorylation of IRF3 at Ser&lt;sup&gt;396&lt;/sup&gt; by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Upon viral infection, HDAC10 was targeted for autophagy-mediated degradation through its interaction with LC3-II. Consequently, IRF3 phosphorylation was increased, which resulted in enhanced type I IFN production and antiviral responses. Our findings identify a potential target for improving host defense responses against pathogen infection and for treating autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PI3K/AKT-mediated autophagy inhibition facilitates mast cell activation to enhance severe inflammatory lung injury in influenza A virus- and secondary Staphylococcus aureus-infected mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549394/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality each year globally, and secondary bacterial infection further exacerbates the severity and fatality of the initial viral infection. Mast cells have substantial roles in protecting the respiratory tract mucosa, while their role in viral and bacterial co-infection remains unclear. The present study revealed that secondary Staphylococcus aureus infection significantly aggravated the activation of mast cells during the initial H1N1 infection both in vivo and in vitro, which was closely related to the increased inflammatory lung injury and mortality. Meanwhile, the secondary S. aureus infection suppressed autophagy and promoted inflammatory mediators released by mast cells through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Blocking PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation, could rescue autophagy and inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, based on the influenza A viral and secondary bacterial infected mice model, we showed that the combination of LY294002 and antiviral drug oseltamivir could effectively reduce the inflammatory damage and pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing in lungs, recovering body weight loss and improving the survival rate from the co-infections. In conclusion, secondary bacterial infection can inhibit autophagy and stimulate mast cell activation through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which might explain why secondary bacterial infection would cause severe and fatal consequences following an initial influenza A viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analogous comparison unravels heightened antiviral defense and boosted viral infection upon immunosuppression in bat organoids</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horseshoe bats host numerous SARS-related coronaviruses without overt disease signs. Bat intestinal organoids, a unique model of bat intestinal epithelium, allow direct comparison with human intestinal organoids. We sought to unravel the cellular mechanism(s) underlying bat tolerance of coronaviruses by comparing the innate immunity in bat and human organoids. We optimized the culture medium, which enabled a consecutive passage of bat intestinal organoids for over one year. Basal expression levels of IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes were higher in bat organoids than in their human counterparts. Notably, bat organoids mounted a more rapid, robust and prolonged antiviral defense than human organoids upon Poly(I:C) stimulation. TLR3 and RLR might be the conserved pathways mediating antiviral response in bat and human intestinal organoids. The susceptibility of bat organoids to a bat coronavirus CoV-HKU4, but resistance to EV-71, an enterovirus of exclusive human origin, indicated that bat organoids adequately recapitulated the authentic susceptibility of bats to certain viruses. Importantly, TLR3/RLR inhibition in bat organoids significantly boosted viral growth in the early phase after SARS-CoV-2 or CoV-HKU4 infection. Collectively, the higher basal expression of antiviral genes, especially more rapid and robust induction of innate immune response, empowered bat cells to curtail virus propagation in the early phase of infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microplastics (MPs) are emerging pollutants which exist in various environments and pose a potential threat to human health. However, the effect of MP on respiratory pathogens-infected organisms is unknown. In order to explore the effect of MP on respiratory pathogen infection, we studied the effect of polystyrene microplastics (PS) on influenza A virus (IAV)-infected A549 cells. Western blot, qPCR, and viral plaque assay demonstrated that PS could promote IAV infection. Further study by bioluminescence imaging showed that a large number of IAV could be enriched on PS and entered cells through endocytosis. Meanwhile, the expression of IFITM3 in cells was significantly reduced. In addition, our results showed that PS down-regulated IRF3 and its active form P-IRF3 by down-regulating RIG-I and inhibiting TBK1 phosphorylation activation, which then significantly reduced IFN-β expression and affected the cellular innate antiviral immune system. Taken together, our results indicate the potential threat of MPs to respiratory diseases caused by IAV and provide new insights into human health protection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are important organelles involved in cell metabolism and programmed cell death in eukaryotic cells and are closely related to the innate immunity of host cells against viruses. Mitophagy is a process in which phagosomes selectively phagocytize damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria to form autophagosomes and is degraded by lysosomes, which control mitochondrial mass and maintain mitochondrial dynamics and cellular homeostasis. Innate immunity is an important part of the immune system and plays a vital role in eliminating viruses. Viral infection causes many physiological and pathological alterations in host cells, including mitophagy and innate immune pathways. Accumulating evidence suggests that some virus promote self-replication through regulating mitophagy-mediated innate immunity. Clarifying the regulatory relationships among mitochondria, mitophagy, innate immunity, and viral infection will shed new insight for pathogenic mechanisms and antiviral strategies. This review systemically summarizes the activation pathways of mitophagy and the relationship between mitochondria and innate immune signaling pathways, and then discusses the mechanisms of viruses on mitophagy and innate immunity and how viruses promote self-replication by regulating mitophagy-mediated innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alveolar macrophages instruct CD8&#43; T cell expansion by antigen cross-presentation in lung</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36516765/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; memory T cells play central roles in protective immunity to respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus (IAV). Here, we find that alveolar macrophages (AMs) function as antigen-presenting cells that support the expansion of lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; memory T cells. Intranasal antigen administration to mice subcutaneously immunized with antigen results in a rapid expansion of antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the lung, which is dependent on antigen cross-presentation by AMs. AMs highly express interleukin-18 (IL-18), which mediates subsequent formation of CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; resident memory T (T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;) cells in the lung. In a mouse model of IAV infection, AMs are required for expansion of virus-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells and inhibiting virus replication in the lungs during secondary infection. These results suggest that AMs instruct a rapid expansion of antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in lung, which protect the host from respiratory virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Herpes Simplex Virus 1-Induced Ferroptosis Contributes to Viral Encephalitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36507835/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a DNA virus belonging to the family Herpesviridae. HSV-1 infection causes severe neurological disease in the central nervous system (CNS), including encephalitis. Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic form of programmed cell death that contributes to different neurological inflammatory diseases. However, whether HSV-1 induces ferroptosis in the CNS and the role of ferroptosis in viral pathogenesis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HSV-1 induces ferroptosis, as hallmarks of ferroptosis, including Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, glutathione (GSH) depletion, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrion shrinkage, are observed in HSV-1-infected cultured human astrocytes, microglia cells, and murine brains. Moreover, HSV-1 infection enhances the E3 ubiquitin ligase Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-related protein 1)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidative genes, thereby disturbing cellular redox homeostasis and promoting ferroptosis. Furthermore, HSV-1-induced ferroptosis is tightly associated with the process of viral encephalitis in a mouse model, and the ferroptosis-activated upregulation of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) plays an important role in HSV-1-caused inflammation and encephalitis. Importantly, the inhibition of ferroptosis by a ferroptosis inhibitor or a proteasome inhibitor to suppress Nrf2 degradation effectively alleviated HSV-1 encephalitis. Together, our findings demonstrate the interaction between HSV-1 infection and ferroptosis and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of HSV-1 encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic form of programmed cell death that contributes to different neurological inflammatory diseases. However, whether HSV-1 induces ferroptosis in the CNS and the role of ferroptosis in viral pathogenesis remain unclear. In the current study, we demonstrate that HSV-1 infection induces ferroptosis, as Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload, ROS accumulation, GSH depletion, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrion shrinkage, all of which are hallmarks of ferroptosis, are observed in human cultured astrocytes, microglia cells, and murine brains infected with HSV-1. Moreover, HSV-1 infection enhances Keap1-dependent Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation, which results in substantial reductions in the expression levels of antiferroptotic genes downstream of Nrf2, thereby disturbing cellular redox homeostasis and promoting ferroptosis. Furthermore, HSV-1-induced ferroptosis is tightly associated with the process of viral encephalitis in a mouse model, and the ferroptosis-activated upregulation of PTGS2 and PGE2 plays an important role in HSV-1-caused inflammation and encephalitis. Importantly, the inhibition of ferroptosis by either a ferroptosis inhibitor or a proteasome inhibitor to suppress HSV-1-induced Nrf2 degradation effectively alleviates HSV-1-caused neuro-damage and inflammation in infected mice. Overall, our findings uncover the interaction between HSV-1 infection and ferroptosis, shed novel light on the physiological impacts of ferroptosis on the pathogenesis of HSV-1 infection and encephalitis, and provide a promising therapeutic strategy to treat this important infectious disease with a worldwide distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Engineering antiviral immune-like systems for autonomous virus detection and inhibition in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36494373/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that viral diseases represent an enormous public health and economic threat to mankind and that individuals with compromised immune systems are at greater risk of complications and death from viral diseases. The development of broad-spectrum antivirals is an important part of pandemic preparedness. Here, we have engineer a series of designer cells which we term autonomous, intelligent, virus-inducible immune-like (ALICE) cells as sense-and-destroy antiviral system. After developing a destabilized STING-based sensor to detect viruses from seven different genera, we have used a synthetic signal transduction system to link viral detection to the expression of multiple antiviral effector molecules, including antiviral cytokines, a CRISPR-Cas9 module for viral degradation and the secretion of a neutralizing antibody. We perform a proof-of-concept study using multiple iterations of our ALICE system in vitro, followed by in vivo functionality testing in mice. We show that dual output ALICE&lt;sub&gt;SaCas9+Ab&lt;/sub&gt; system delivered by an AAV-vector inhibited viral infection in herpetic simplex keratitis (HSK) mouse model. Our work demonstrates that viral detection and antiviral countermeasures can be paired for intelligent sense-and-destroy applications as a flexible and innovative method against virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular states during acute COVID-19 reveal distinct etiologies of long-term sequelae</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36482101/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are debilitating, clinically heterogeneous and of unknown molecular etiology. A transcriptome-wide investigation was performed in 165 acutely infected hospitalized individuals who were followed clinically into the post-acute period. Distinct gene expression signatures of post-acute sequelae were already present in whole blood during acute infection, with innate and adaptive immune cells implicated in different symptoms. Two clusters of sequelae exhibited divergent plasma-cell-associated gene expression patterns. In one cluster, sequelae associated with higher expression of immunoglobulin-related genes in an anti-spike antibody titer-dependent manner. In the other, sequelae associated independently of these titers with lower expression of immunoglobulin-related genes, indicating lower non-specific antibody production in individuals with these sequelae. This relationship between lower total immunoglobulins and sequelae was validated in an external cohort. Altogether, multiple etiologies of post-acute sequelae were already detectable during SARS-CoV-2 infection, directly linking these sequelae with the acute host response to the virus and providing early insights into their development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When ferroptosis meets pathogenic infections</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36496309/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pathogens regulate ferroptosis to promote their replication, dissemination, pathogenesis, or evade host immune responses, which benefits the survival of pathogens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pathogens interact with the classic antioxidant system, the GPX4-dependent pathway, to disturb intracellular lipid ROS elimination, to manipulate ferroptosis execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pathogens commandeer lipid ROS by adjusting iron, lipid, and mitochondria metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulation of pathogen-associated ferroptosis is a promising therapeutic strategy against infectious diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy are diverse types of regulated cell death (RCD), recognized as the strategies that host cells use to defend against pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Pathogens can induce or block different types of host cell RCD, promoting propagation or evading host immune surveillance. Ferroptosis is a newly identified RCD. Evidence has demonstrated how pathogens regulate ferroptosis to promote their replication, dissemination, and pathogenesis. However, the interaction between ferroptosis and pathogenic infections still needs to be completely elucidated. This review summarizes the advances in the interaction between pathogenic infections and host ferroptotic processes, focusing on the underlying mechanisms of how pathogens exploit ferroptosis, and discussing possible therapeutic measures against pathogen-associated diseases in a ferroptosis-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of cannabinoid-2 receptor protects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced acute lung injury and inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463179/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Bacterial pneumonia is a major risk factor for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; (PA), an opportunistic pathogen with an increasing resistance acquired against multiple drugs, is one of the main causative agents of ALI and ARDS in diverse clinical settings. Given the anti-inflammatory role of the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2R), the effect of CB2R activation in the regulation of PA-induced ALI and inflammation was tested in a mouse model as an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In order to activate CB2R, a selective synthetic agonist, JWH133, was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, SR144528 (a selective CB2R antagonist) was administered in combination with JWH133 to test the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effect. PA was administered intratracheally (i.t.) for induction of pneumonia in mice. At 24 h after PA exposure, lung mechanics were measured using the FlexiVent system. The total cell number, protein content, and neutrophil population in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. The bacterial load in the whole lung was also measured. Lung injury was evaluated by histological examination and PA-induced inflammation was assessed by measuring the levels of BALF cytokines and chemokines. Neutrophil activation (examined by immunofluorescence and immunoblot) and PA-induced inflammatory signaling (analyzed by immunoblot) were also studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CB2R activation by JWH133 was found to significantly reduce PA-induced ALI and the bacterial burden. CB2R activation also suppressed the PA-induced increase in immune cell infiltration, neutrophil population, and inflammatory cytokines. These effects were abrogated by a CB2R antagonist, SR144528, further confirming the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effects. CB2R-knock out (CB2RKO) mice had a significantly higher level of PA-induced inflammation as compared to that in WT mice. CB2R activation diminished the excess activation of neutrophils, whereas mice lacking CB2R had elevated neutrophil activation. Pharmacological activation of CB2R significantly reduced the PA-induced NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, whereas CB2KO mice had elevated NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings indicate that CB2R activation ameliorates PA-induced lung injury and inflammation, thus paving the path for new therapeutic avenues against PA pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Splenic-targeting biomimetic nanovaccine for elevating protective immunity against virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463277/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The prevalence of viral infectious diseases has become a serious threat to public safety, economic and social development. Vaccines have been served as the most effective platform to prevent virus transmission via the activation of host immune responses, while the low immunogenicity or safety, the high cost of production, storage, transport limit their effective clinical application. Therefore, there is a need to develop a promising strategy to improve the immunogenicity and safety of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We developed a splenic-targeting biomimetic nanovaccine (NV) that can boost protective humoral and cellular immunity against african swine fever virus (ASFV) infection. The universal PLGA nanoparticles (CMR-PLGA/p54 NPs) coated with mannose and CpG (TLR9 agonist) co-modified red blood cell (RBC) membrane were prepared, which comprised a viral antigen (p54) and can be served as a versatile nanovaccine for elevating protective immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CMR-PLGA/p54 NVs could be effectively uptaken by BMDC and promoted BMDC maturation in vitro. After subcutaneous immunization, antigen could be effectively delivered to the splenic dendritic cells (DCs) due to the splenic homing ability of RBC and DC targeting capacity of mannose, which promoted antigen presentation and DCs maturation, and further elicited higher levels of cytokines secretion and specific IgG titers, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells activation and B maturation. Moreover, NVs demonstrated notable safety during the immunization period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study demonstrates the high potential of CMR-PLGA NPs as vaccine delivery carriers to promote humoral and cellular immune responses, and it provides a promising strategy to develop safe and effective vaccines against viral infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 replication in airway epithelia requires motile cilia and microvillar reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36580912/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 on multicilia in airway epithelia immediately upon infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depleting motile cilia inhibits viral entry by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 activates PAK kinases to rearrange airway microvilli driving viral exit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Omicron variants accelerate cilia-dependent entry through the airway mucin barrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the airway barrier of mucus and periciliary mucins to infect nasal epithelium remains unclear. Using primary nasal epithelial organoid cultures, we found that the virus attaches to motile cilia via the ACE2 receptor. SARS-CoV-2 traverses the mucus layer, using motile cilia as tracks to access the cell body. Depleting cilia blocks infection for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 progeny attach to airway microvilli 24 h post-infection and trigger formation of apically extended and highly branched microvilli that organize viral egress from the microvilli back into the mucus layer, supporting a model of virus dispersion throughout airway tissue via mucociliary transport. Phosphoproteomics and kinase inhibition reveal that microvillar remodeling is regulated by p21-activated kinases (PAK). Importantly, Omicron variants bind with higher affinity to motile cilia and show accelerated viral entry. Our work suggests that motile cilia, microvilli, and mucociliary-dependent mucus flow are critical for efficient virus replication in nasal epithelia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut dysbiosis induces the development of mastitis through a reduction in host anti-inflammatory enzyme activity by endotoxemia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36451232/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Mounting experimental evidence has shown that the gut microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of mastitis, and clinical investigations have found that the occurrence of mastitis is correlated with ruminal dysbiosis. However, the underlying mechanism by which the ruminal microbiota participates in the development of mastitis remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In the present study, we found that cows with clinical mastitis had marked systemic inflammation, which was associated with significant ruminal dysbiosis, especially enriched Proteobacteria in the rumen. Ruminal microbiota transplantation from mastitis cows (M-RMT) to mice induced mastitis symptoms in recipient mice along with increased mammary proinflammatory signature activation of the TLR4-cGAS-STING-NF-κB/NLRP3 pathways. M-RMT also induced mucosal inflammation and impaired intestinal barrier integrity, leading to increased endotoxemia and systemic inflammation. Moreover, we showed that M-RMT mirrored ruminal microbiota disruption in the gut of recipient mice, as evidenced by enriched Proteobacteria and similar bacterial functions, which were correlated with most proinflammatory parameters and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in mice. Recurrent low-grade LPS treatment mirrored gut dysbiosis-induced endotoxemia and caused severe mastitis in mice. Furthermore, we found that gut dysbiosis-derived LPS reduced host alkaline phosphatase activity by activating neuraminidase (Neu), which facilitates low-grade LPS exposure and E. coli-induced mastitis in mice. Conversely, treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase or the Neu inhibitor zanamivir alleviated low-grade LPS exposure and E. coli-induced mastitis in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results suggest that ruminal dysbiosis-derived low-grade endotoxemia can cause mastitis and aggravate pathogen-induced mastitis by impairing host anti-inflammatory enzymes, which implies that regulating the ruminal or gut microbiota to prevent low-grade systemic inflammation is a potential strategy for mastitis intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HTLV-1 infection of donor-derived T cells might promote acute graft-versus-host disease following liver transplantation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36450748/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) is a rare, but severe complication of liver transplantation (LT). It is caused by the activation of donor immune cells in the graft against the host shortly after transplantation, but the contributing pathogenic factors remain unclear. Here we show that human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) infection of donor T cells is highly associated with aGVHD following LT. The presence of HTLV-1 in peripheral blood and tissue samples from a discovery cohort of 7 aGVHD patients and 17 control patients is assessed with hybridization probes (TargetSeq), mass cytometry (CyTOF), and multiplex immunohistology (IMC). All 7 of our aGVHD patients display detectable HTLV-1 Tax signals by IMC. We identify donor-derived cells based on a Y chromosome-specific genetic marker, EIF1AY. Thus, we confirm the presence of CD4+Tax+EIF1AY+ T cells and Tax+CD68+EIF1AY+ antigen-presenting cells, indicating HTLV-1 infection of donor immune cells. In an independent cohort of 400 patients, we verify that HTLV-1 prevalence correlates with aGVHD incidence, while none of the control viruses shows significant associations. Our findings thus provide new insights into the aetio-pathology of liver-transplantation-associated aGVHD and raise the possibility of preventing aGVHD prior to transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meet changes with constancy: Defence, antagonism, recovery, and immunity roles of extracellular vesicles in confronting SARS-CoV-2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has wrought havoc on the world economy and people&amp;rsquo;s daily lives. The inability to comprehensively control COVID-19 is due to the difficulty of early and timely diagnosis, the lack of effective therapeutic drugs, and the limited effectiveness of vaccines. The body contains billions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have shown remarkable potential in disease diagnosis, drug development, and vaccine carriers. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that EVs may participate or assist the body in defence, antagonism, recovery and acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2. On the one hand, intercepting and decrypting the general intelligence carried in circulating EVs from COVID-19 patients will provide an important hint for diagnosis and treatment; on the other hand, engineered EVs modified by gene editing in the laboratory will amplify the effectiveness of inhibiting infection, replication and destruction of ever-mutating SARS-CoV-2, facilitating tissue repair and making a better vaccine. To comprehensively understand the interaction between EVs and SARS-CoV-2, providing new insights to overcome some difficulties in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19, we conducted a rounded review in this area. We also explain numerous critical challenges that these tactics face before they enter the clinic, and this work will provide previous &amp;lsquo;meet change with constancy&amp;rsquo; lessons for responding to future similar public health disasters. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide a &amp;lsquo;meet changes with constancy&amp;rsquo; strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2 that spans defence, antagonism, recovery, and acquired immunity. Targets for COVID-19 diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of progression may be found by capture of the message decoding in circulating EVs. Engineered and biomimetic EVs can boost effects of the natural EVs, especially anti-SARS-CoV-2, targeted repair of damaged tissue, and improvement of vaccine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The RNA polymerase of cytoplasmically replicating Zika virus binds with chromatin DNA in nuclei and regulates host gene transcription</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36442102/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36442102/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), replicate in the cytoplasm of host cells, but they can regulate host gene expression in the nucleus. Here, we report that the ZIKV NS5, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and essential for the viral replication in the cytoplasm, can directly bind with chromatin DNA in the nuclei. In human neural progenitor cells, NS5 inhibits the transcription of numerous neural genes by binding onto their gene body and blocking PAF1C-mediated transcription elongation. The expression of ZIKV NS5 disrupts neurogenesis in developing mouse brain. Our findings reveal a role of ZIKV RdRp as a DNA binding protein to regulate host gene transcription and provide insights into abnormal neurodevelopment and ZIKV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zika virus (ZIKV) targets the neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in brain during intrauterine infections and consequently causes severe neurological disorders, such as microcephaly in neonates. Although replicating in the cytoplasm, ZIKV dysregulates the expression of thousands of host genes, yet the detailed mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we report that ZIKV encodes a unique DNA-binding protein to regulate host gene transcription in the nucleus. We found that ZIKV NS5, the viral RNA polymerase, associates tightly with host chromatin DNA through its methyltransferase domain and this interaction could be specifically blocked by GTP. Further study showed that expression of ZIKV NS5 in human NPCs markedly suppressed the transcription of its target genes, especially the genes involved in neurogenesis. Mechanistically, ZIKV NS5 binds onto the gene body of its target genes and then blocks their transcriptional elongation. The utero electroporation in pregnant mice showed that NS5 expression significantly disrupts the neurogenesis by reducing the number of Sox2- and Tbr2-positive cells in the fetal cortex. Together, our findings demonstrate a molecular clue linking to the abnormal neurodevelopment caused by ZIKV infection and also provide intriguing insights into the interaction between the host cell and the pathogenic RNA virus, where the cytoplasmic RNA virus encodes a DNA-binding protein to control the transcription of host cell in the nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epstein-Barr virus miR-BART2-5p and miR-BART11-5p regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration by targeting RB and p21 in gastric carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36418188/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the first tumor virus discovered in humans and can cause various types of tumors. Molecular classification suggests that EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) is a unique subtype of gastric cancer.EBV was also the first virus found to encode its own microRNAs. However, the functions of many miRNAs remain unknown. This study investigated the roles and targets of miR-BART2-5p (BART2-5p) and miR-BART11-5p (BART11-5p) in EBVaGC. The expression of RB and p21 in EBVaGC and EBV negative GC (EBVnGC) cells was evaluated by western blotting. Expression of BART2-5p and BART11-5p in EBVaGC cells was evaluated by droplet digital PCR. The effects of BART2-5p or BART11-5p and their potential mechanisms were further investigated using cell counting kit-8, colony formation assay, flow cytometry analysis, and transwell assay. BART2-5p and BART11-5p were abundantly expressed and RB and p21 were downregulated in EBVaGC cells. BART2-5p regulates RB and p21 expression by directly targeting them. BART11-5p regulates RB expression by directly targeting RB. Both BART2-5p and BART11-5p promoted proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells, while inhibiting apoptosis and promoting S-phase arrest of the cell cycle. Thus, BART2-5p and BART11-5p play important roles in promoting proliferation and migration, and inhibiting apoptosis in EBVaGC by targeting RB and p21, thus providing new potential therapeutic targets for EBVaGC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Infection phase-dependent dynamics of the viral and host N6-methyladenosine epitranscriptome in the lifecycle of an oncogenic virus in vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36401345/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic alteration of the epitranscriptome exerts regulatory effects on the lifecycle of oncogenic viruses in vitro. However, little is known about these effects in vivo because of the general lack of suitable animal infection models of these viruses. Using a model of rapid-onset Marek&amp;rsquo;s disease lymphoma in chickens, we investigated changes in viral and host mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) modification during Marek&amp;rsquo;s disease virus (MDV) infection in vivo. We found that the expression of major epitranscriptomic proteins varies among viral infection phases, reprogramming both the viral and the host epitranscriptomes. Specifically, the METTL3/14 complex was suppressed during the lytic and reactivation phases of the MDV lifecycle, whereas its expression was increased during the latent phase and in MDV-induced tumors. METTL3/14 overexpression inhibits, whereas METTL3/14 knockdown enhances, MDV gene expression and replication. These findings reveal the dynamic features of the mRNA m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification program during viral replication in vivo, especially in relation to key pathways involved in tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The emerging field of oncolytic virus-based cancer immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36402738/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/36402738/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural or genetically modified oncolytic viruses (OVs) are promising antitumor agents for specifically targeting tumor cells without harming normal cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OV-based oncolysis and OV-induced antiviral immune responses play an important role in remodeling the tumor microenvironment (TME) from immunologically &amp;lsquo;cold&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;hot&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As single agents or combined with other strategies, OVs can enhance cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OV persistence, replication, spread, systemic delivery, lack of therapeutic biomarkers, and moderate efficacy as single agents are among the main challenges in the field. If these problems can be solved, OV will most likely substantially enhance clinical outcomes for cancer patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oncolytic viruses (OVs) provide novel and promising therapeutic options for patients with cancers resistant to traditional therapies. Natural or genetically modified OVs are multifaceted tumor killers. They directly lyse tumor cells while sparing normal cells, and indirectly potentiate antitumor immunity by releasing antigens and activating inflammatory responses in the tumor microenvironment. However, some limitations, such as limited penetration of OVs into tumors, short persistence, and the host antiviral immune response, are impeding the broad translation of oncolytic virotherapy into the clinic. If these challenges can be overcome, combination therapies, such as OVs plus immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, or CAR natural killer (NK) cells, may provide powerful therapeutic platforms in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interference with LTβR signaling by tick saliva facilitates transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36383602/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyme spirochetes have coevolved with ticks to optimize transmission to hosts using tick salivary molecules (TSMs) to counteract host defenses. TSMs modulate various molecular events at the tick-host interface. Lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTβR) is a vital immune receptor and plays protective roles in host immunity against microbial infections. We found that &lt;em&gt;Ltbr&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice were more susceptible to Lyme disease spirochetes, suggesting the involvement of LTβR signaling in tick-borne &lt;em&gt;Borrelia&lt;/em&gt; infection. Further investigation showed that a 15-kDa TSM protein from &lt;em&gt;Ixodes persulcatus&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;I. persulcatus salivary&lt;/em&gt; protein; IpSAP) functioned as an immunosuppressant to facilitate the transmission and infection of Lyme disease spirochetes. IpSAP directly interacts with LTβR to block its activation, thus inhibiting the downstream signaling and consequently suppressing immunity. IpSAP immunization provided mice with significant protection against &lt;em&gt;I. persulcatus&lt;/em&gt;-mediated &lt;em&gt;Borrelia garinii&lt;/em&gt; infection. Notably, the immunization showed considerable cross-protection against other &lt;em&gt;Borrelia&lt;/em&gt; infections mediated by other ixodid ticks. One of the IpSAP homologs from other ixodid ticks showed similar effects on Lyme spirochete transmission. Together, our findings suggest that LTβR signaling plays an important role in blocking the transmission and pathogenesis of tick-borne Lyme disease spirochetes, and that IpSAP and its homologs are promising candidates for broad-spectrum vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AMPK directly phosphorylates TBK1 to integrate glucose sensing into innate immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36384137/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viral infection induces acute blood glucose decline in rodents that activates AMPK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMPK directly phosphorylates TBK1 at S511 to prime antiviral sensing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMPK-TBK1 couples glucose deficiency sensing and innate immune surveillance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting the AMPK-TBK1 axis compromises innate antiviral immunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutrient sensing and damage sensing are two fundamental processes in living organisms. While hyperglycemia is frequently linked to diabetes-related vulnerability to microbial infection, how body glucose levels affect innate immune responses to microbial invasion is not fully understood. Here, we surprisingly found that viral infection led to a rapid and dramatic decrease in blood glucose levels in rodents, leading to robust AMPK activation. AMPK, once activated, directly phosphorylates TBK1 at S511, which triggers IRF3 recruitment and the assembly of MAVS or STING signalosomes. Consistently, ablation or inhibition of AMPK, knockin of TBK1-S511A, or increased glucose levels compromised nucleic acid sensing, while boosting AMPK-TBK1 cascade by AICAR or TBK1-S511E knockin improves antiviral immunity substantially in various animal models. Thus, we identify TBK1 as an AMPK substrate, reveal the molecular mechanism coupling a dual sensing of glucose and nuclei acids, and report its physiological necessity in antiviral defense.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Melatonin Suppresses Macrophage M1 Polarization and ROS-Mediated Pyroptosis via Activating ApoE/LDLR Pathway in Influenza A-Induced Acute Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza virus infection is one of the strongest pathogenic factors for the development of acute lung injury (ALI)/ acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms have not been clarified. In this study, we aim to investigate whether melatonin modulates macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis via activating Apolipoprotein E/low-density lipoprotein receptor (ApoE/LDLR) pathway in influenza A-induced ALI. Here, wild-type (WT) and ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice were instilled intratracheally with influenza A (H3N2) and injected intraperitoneally with melatonin for 7 consecutive days. In vitro, WT and ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were pretreated with melatonin before H3N2 stimulation. The results showed that melatonin administration significantly attenuated H3N2-induced pulmonary damage, leukocyte infiltration, and edema; decreased the expression of proinflammatory M1 markers; enhanced anti-inflammatory M2 markers; and switched the polarization of alveolar macrophages (AMs) from M1 to M2 phenotype. Additionally, melatonin inhibited reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) mediated pyroptosis shown by downregulation of malonaldehyde (MDA) and ROS levels as well as inhibition of the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Strikingly, the ApoE/LDLR pathway was activated when melatonin was applied in H3N2-infected macrophages and mice. ApoE knockout mostly abrogated the protective impacts of melatonin on H3N2-induced ALI and its regulatory ability on macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis. Furthermore, recombinant ApoE3 (re-ApoE3) inhibited H3N2-induced M1 polarization of BMDMs with upregulation of MT1 and MT2 expression, but re-ApoE2 and re-ApoE4 failed to do this. Melatonin combined with re-ApoE3 played more beneficial protective effects on modulating macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis in H3N2-infected ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; BMDMs. Our study indicated that melatonin attenuated influenza A- (H3N2-) induced ALI by inhibiting the M1 polarization of pulmonary macrophages and ROS-mediated pyroptosis via activating the ApoE/LDLR pathway. This study suggested that melatonin-ApoE/LDLR axis may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for influenza virus-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acute and postacute sequelae associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36357676/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with increased risk of acute and postacute death and sequelae in various organ systems. Whether reinfection adds to risks incurred after first infection is unclear. Here we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs&amp;rsquo; national healthcare database to build a cohort of individuals with one SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 443,588), reinfection (two or more infections, n = 40,947) and a noninfected control (n = 5,334,729). We used inverse probability-weighted survival models to estimate risks and 6-month burdens of death, hospitalization and incident sequelae. Compared to no reinfection, reinfection contributed additional risks of death (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.17, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.93-2.45), hospitalization (HR = 3.32, 95% CI 3.13-3.51) and sequelae including pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematological, diabetes, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, musculoskeletal and neurological disorders. The risks were evident regardless of vaccination status. The risks were most pronounced in the acute phase but persisted in the postacute phase at 6 months. Compared to noninfected controls, cumulative risks and burdens of repeat infection increased according to the number of infections. Limitations included a cohort of mostly white males. The evidence shows that reinfection further increases risks of death, hospitalization and sequelae in multiple organ systems in the acute and postacute phase. Reducing overall burden of death and disease due to SARS-CoV-2 will require strategies for reinfection prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNAs as emerging regulators in COVID-19 pathogenesis and progression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36439162/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious acute respiratory disease caused by a newly emerging RNA virus, is a still-growing pandemic that has caused more than 6 million deaths globally and has seriously threatened the lives and health of people across the world. Currently, several drugs have been used in the clinical treatment of COVID-19, such as small molecules, neutralizing antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies. In addition, several vaccines have been used to prevent the spread of the pandemic, such as adenovirus vector vaccines, inactivated vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. However, the efficacy of vaccines and the onset of adverse reactions vary among individuals. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are crucial regulators of viral infections and antiviral immune responses and are heavily involved in COVID-19 pathologies. During novel coronavirus infection, circRNAs not only directly affect the transcription process and interfere with viral replication but also indirectly regulate biological processes, including virus-host receptor binding and the immune response. Consequently, understanding the expression and function of circRNAs during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will provide novel insights into the development of circRNA-based methods. In this review, we summarize recent progress on the roles and underlying mechanisms of circRNAs that regulate the inflammatory response, viral replication, immune evasion, and cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thus highlighting the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in the treatment of COVID-19 and future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interrogation of the mammalian gut-brain axis using LC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics with in vitro bacterial and organoid cultures and in vivo gnotobiotic mouse models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in the communication between the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system, known as the gut-brain axis, has prompted the development of quantitative analytical platforms to analyze microbe- and host-derived signals. This protocol enables investigations into connections between microbial colonization and intestinal and brain neurotransmitters and contains strategies for the comprehensive evaluation of metabolites in in vitro (organoids) and in vivo mouse model systems. Here we present an optimized workflow that includes procedures for preparing these gut-brain axis model systems: (stage 1) growth of microbes in defined media; (stage 2) microinjection of intestinal organoids; and (stage 3) generation of animal models including germ-free (no microbes), specific-pathogen-free (complete gut microbiota) and specific-pathogen-free re-conventionalized (germ-free mice associated with a complete gut microbiota from a specific-pathogen-free mouse), and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium dentium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides ovatus&lt;/em&gt; mono-associated mice (germ-free mice colonized with a single gut microbe). We describe targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomics methods for analyzing microbially derived short-chain fatty acids and neurotransmitters from these samples. Unlike other protocols that commonly examine only stool samples, this protocol includes bacterial cultures, organoid cultures and in vivo samples, in addition to monitoring the metabolite content of stool samples. The incorporation of three experimental models (microbes, organoids and animals) enhances the impact of this protocol. The protocol requires 3 weeks of murine colonization with microbes and ~1-2 weeks for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based instrumental and quantitative analysis, and sample post-processing and normalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bats are reservoir hosts of many zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential. We utilized single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the immune response in bat lungs upon &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; infection with a double-stranded RNA virus, &lt;em&gt;Pteropine orthoreovirus&lt;/em&gt; PRV3M. Bat neutrophils were distinguished by high basal &lt;em&gt;IDO1&lt;/em&gt; expression. NK cells and T cells were the most abundant immune cells in lung tissue. Three distinct CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; effector T cell populations could be delineated by differential expression of &lt;em&gt;KLRB1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;GFRA2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DPP4&lt;/em&gt;. Select NK and T clusters increased expression of genes involved in T cell activation and effector function early after viral infection. Alveolar macrophages and classical monocytes drove antiviral interferon signaling. Infection expanded a &lt;em&gt;CSF1R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; population expressing collagen-like genes, which became the predominant myeloid cell type post-infection. This work uncovers features relevant to viral disease tolerance in bats, lays a foundation for future experimental work, and serves as a resource for comparative immunology studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ABHD16A Negatively Regulates the Palmitoylation and Antiviral Function of IFITM Proteins</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36314839/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are small homologous proteins that are encoded by the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which can be strongly induced by interferon (IFN) and provide resistance to invasion by a variety of viral pathogens. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying this function have remained elusive. The antiviral activity of IFITMs from different species depends on S-palmitoylation at conserved cysteine residues. However, specific enzymes involved in the dynamic palmitoylation cycle of IFITMs, especially depalmitoylase, have not yet been reported. Here, we demonstrate that α/-hydrolase domain-containing 16A (ABHD16A) is a depalmitoylase and a negative regulator of IFITM protein that can catalyze the depalmitoyl reaction of S-palmitoylated IFITM proteins, thereby decreasing their antiviral activities on RNA viruses. Using the acyl-PEGyl exchange gel shift (APEGS) assay, we identified ABHD16A proteins from humans, pigs, and mice that can directly participate in the palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycles of IFITMs in the constructed &lt;em&gt;abhd16a&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; cells and ABHD16A-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, we showed that ABHD16A functions as a regulator of subcellular localization of IFITM proteins and is related to the immune system. It is tempting to suggest that pharmacological intervention in IFITMs and ABHD16A can be achieved either through controlling their expression or regulating their activity, thereby providing a broad-spectrum therapeutic strategy for animal viral diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFITM protein is the cells first line of antiviral defense that blocks early stages of viral replication; the underlying mechanism might be associated with the proper distribution in cells. The palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle can dynamically regulate protein localization, stability, and function. This work is the first one that found the critical enzyme that participates in the palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle of IFITM, and this type of palmitoyl loss may be an essential regulation mode for balancing the antiviral functions of the IFN pathway. These findings imply that the pharmacological intervention in IFITM and ABHD16A, either through controlling their expression or regulating their activities, could provide a broad-spectrum therapeutic strategy for animal viral diseases and complications linked to interferon elevation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cellular glycan modification by B3GAT1 broadly restricts influenza virus infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communicable respiratory viral infections pose both epidemic and pandemic threats and broad-spectrum antiviral strategies could improve preparedness for these events. To discover host antiviral restriction factors that may act as suitable targets for the development of host-directed antiviral therapies, we here conduct a whole-genome CRISPR activation screen with influenza B virus (IBV). A top hit from our screen, beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase 1 (B3GAT1), effectively blocks IBV infection. Subsequent studies reveal that B3GAT1 activity prevents cell surface sialic acid expression. Due to this mechanism of action, B3GAT1 expression broadly restricts infection with viruses that require sialic acid for entry, including Victoria and Yamagata lineage IBVs, H1N1/H3N2 influenza A viruses (IAVs), and the unrelated enterovirus D68. To understand the potential utility of B3GAT1 induction as an antiviral strategy in vivo, we specifically express B3GAT1 in the murine respiratory epithelium and find that overexpression is not only well-tolerated, but also protects female mice from a lethal viral challenge with multiple influenza viruses, including a pandemic-like H1N1 IAV. Thus, B3GAT1 may represent a host-directed broad-spectrum antiviral target with utility against clinically relevant respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The influenza virus PB2 protein evades antiviral innate immunity by inhibiting JAK1/STAT signalling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) polymerase protein PB2 has been shown to partially inhibit the host immune response by blocking the induction of interferons (IFNs). However, the IAV PB2 protein that regulates the downstream signaling pathway of IFNs is not well characterized. Here, we report that IAV PB2 protein reduces cellular sensitivity to IFNs, suppressing the activation of STAT1/STAT2 and ISGs. Furthermore, IAV PB2 protein targets mammalian JAK1 at lysine 859 and 860 for ubiquitination and degradation. Notably, the H5 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus with I283M/K526R mutations on PB2 increases the ability to degrade mammalian JAK1 and exhibits higher replicate efficiency in mammalian (but not avian) cells and mouse lung tissues, and causes greater mortality in infected mice. Altogether, these data describe a negative regulatory mechanism involving PB2-JAK1 and provide insights into an evasion strategy from host antiviral immunity employed by IAV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SRSF5-Mediated Alternative Splicing of M Gene is Essential for Influenza A Virus Replication: A Host-Directed Target Against Influenza Virus</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36257906/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splicing of influenza A virus (IAV) RNA is an essential process in the viral life cycle that involves the co-opting of host factors. Here, it is demonstrated that induction of host serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 5 (SRSF5) by IAV facilitated viral replication by enhancing viral M mRNA splicing. Mechanistically, SRSF5 with its RRM2 domain directly bounds M mRNA at conserved sites (M mRNA position 163, 709, and 712), and interacts with U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) to promote M mRNA splicing and M2 production. Mutations introduced to the three binding sites, without changing amino acid code, significantly attenuates virus replication and pathogenesis in vivo. Likewise, SRSF5 conditional knockout in the lung protects mice against lethal IAV challenge. Furthermore, anidulafungin, an approved antifungal drug, is identified as an inhibitor of SRSF5 that effectively blocks IAV replication in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, SRSF5 as an activator of M mRNA splicing promotes IAV replication and is a host-derived antiviral target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5-methylcytosine (m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C) is a common RNA methylation. However, its biological functions remain a mystery. Here, we discover that depletion of NSUN2, an m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methyltransferase, leads to an enhanced type I interferon (IFN) response, which significantly inhibits replication of a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses in vitro. Notably, this m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C-mediated antiviral innate immunity is also conserved in an in vivo mouse model. Mechanistically, depletion of the m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methyltransferase decreases the host RNA m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylome and enhances polymerase III–transcribed noncoding RNAs that are recognized by RIG-I to trigger enhanced type I IFN signaling. Our study reveals a role of m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C in regulating innate immunity and highlights m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C as a new target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5-methylcytosine (m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C) is one of the most prevalent modifications of RNA, playing important roles in RNA metabolism, nuclear export, and translation. However, the potential role of RNA m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylation in innate immunity remains elusive. Here, we show that depletion of NSUN2, an m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methyltransferase, significantly inhibits the replication and gene expression of a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses. Notably, we found that this antiviral effect is largely driven by an enhanced type I interferon (IFN) response. The antiviral signaling pathway is dependent on the cytosolic RNA sensor RIG-I but not MDA5. Transcriptome-wide mapping of m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C following NSUN2 depletion in human A549 cells revealed a marked reduction in the m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylation of several abundant noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). However, m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylation of viral RNA was not noticeably altered by NSUN2 depletion. In NSUN2-depleted cells, the host RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcribed ncRNAs, in particular RPPH1 and 7SL RNAs, were substantially up-regulated, leading to an increase of unshielded 7SL RNA in cytoplasm, which served as a direct ligand for the RIG-I-mediated IFN response. In NSUN2-depleted cells, inhibition of Pol III transcription or silencing of RPPH1 and 7SL RNA dampened IFN signaling, partially rescuing viral replication and gene expression. Finally, depletion of NSUN2 in an ex vivo human lung model and a mouse model inhibits viral replication and reduces pathogenesis, which is accompanied by enhanced type I IFN responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that RNA m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylation controls antiviral innate immunity through modulating the m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylome of ncRNAs and their expression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A bacterial phospholipid phosphatase inhibits host pyroptosis by hijacking ubiquitin</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36227980/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36227980/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis is a proinflammatory form of programmed cell death adopted by mammalian hosts to control infections, but how pathogens evade this immune response remains largely unexplored. Chai et al. found that PtpB, a known protein phosphatase secreted by &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;, acts as a phospholipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates host plasma membrane phosphoinositides upon activation by ubiquitin to inhibit pyroptosis. These findings reveal a delicate strategy by which pathogens suppress pyroptosis by altering host membrane composition, and provide a potential tuberculosis treatment by targeting the PtpB-ubiquitin interacting interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inflammasome-mediated cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) causes pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release to control pathogen infection, but how pathogens evade this immune response remains largely unexplored. Here we identify the known protein phosphatase PtpB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a phospholipid phosphatase inhibiting the host inflammasome-pyroptosis pathway. Mechanistically, PtpB dephosphorylated phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate in host cell membrane, thus disrupting the membrane localization of the cleaved GSDMD to inhibit cytokine release and pyroptosis of macrophages. Notably, this phosphatase activity requires PtpB binding to ubiquitin. Disrupting phospholipid phosphatase activity or the ubiquitin-interacting motif of PtpB enhanced host GSDMD-dependent immune responses and reduced intracellular pathogen survival. Thus, pathogens inhibit pyroptosis and counteract host immunity by altering host membrane composition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis is a proinflammatory form of programmed cell death characterized by membrane pore formation that allows the release of intracellular inflammatory mediators, a process that is elicited by the inflammasome-mediated cleavage and activation of gasdermin D (GSDMD). Growing evidence supports a critical role for pyroptosis in the control of infections by mammalian hosts, but how pathogens evade this immune response remains largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; (Mtb), an ancient pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB), has developed numerous intracellular survival strategies to evade host immunity and to drive the occurrence and development of TB. One notable feature evolved by Mtb is a set of eukaryotic-like effectors, but their host targets and regulatory roles in pathogen–host interactions remain largely unclear. In this study, we sought to identify the key pathogenic regulators of inflammasome-pyroptosis pathways from Mtb eukaryotic-like effectors, information that could improve our understanding of TB pathogenesis and provide potential targets for novel anti-TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined the whole genome of Mtb to predict its secreted eukaryotic-like proteins possessing eukaryotic-like motifs or domains that might target host factors directly. These Mtb effector proteins were then subjected to further experimental analyses using an inflammasome reconstitution system for screening inhibitors of inflammasome-pyroptosis pathways. Out of 201 predicted Mtb-secreted eukaryotic proteins, six Mtb proteins (Rv0153c, Rv0561c, Rv0824c, Rv0861c, Rv1515c, and Rv1679) exhibited strong inhibitory effects on both NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome pathways. Among these proteins, PtpB (i.e., Rv0153c) was most abundantly secreted by Mtb during infection. We thus focused on PtpB and further confirmed its inhibitory effect on AIM2 or NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that PtpB inhibited gasdermin D (GSDMD)–dependent cytokine release and pyroptosis to promote Mtb intracellular survival in macrophages. Mechanistically, Mtb-secreted PtpB could target and dephosphorylate host plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] to inhibit the membrane localization of the N-terminal cleavage fragment of GSDMD (GSDMD-N), thus preventing GSDMD-mediated immune responses. This phosphoinositide phosphatase activity requires binding of PtpB to ubiquitin. Accordingly, disrupting phospholipid phosphatase activity or the unusual ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)–like domain of PtpB markedly enhanced host innate immune responses and reduced intracellular pathogen survival in mice in a GSDMD-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release play a critical role in host anti-infection immunity, which is counteracted by Mtb effector protein PtpB. Our data reveal a role of the pathogen-derived phospholipid phosphatase in the regulation of GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis and cytokine releases, extending our understanding of the elaborate regulatory mechanism of cellular inflammasome-pyroptosis signaling pathways during pathogen infection. The present study also presents a strategy by which pathogens hijack ubiquitin to inhibit host pyroptosis by altering the phospholipid composition of the host membrane. Our discovery of the PtpB UIM-like domain, which is not homologous to any human protein, may provide potential selectivity for the development of anti-TB therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facts and Hopes in the Relationship of EBV with Cancer Immunity and Immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35686929/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the first identified human tumor virus, infects and takes up residency in almost every human. However, EBV genome-positive tumors arise in only a tiny minority of infected people, presumably when the virus-carrying tumor cells are able to evade immune surveillance. Traditional views regard viral antigens as the principal targets of host immune surveillance against virus-infected cells. However, recent findings indicate that EBV-infected/-transformed B cells elicit both cytotoxic CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell responses against a wide range of overexpressed cellular antigens known to function as tumor-associated antigens (TAA), in addition to various EBV-encoded antigens. This not only broadens the ways by which the immune system controls EBV infection and prevents it from causing cancers, but also potentially extends immune protection toward EBV-unrelated cancers by targeting shared TAAs. The goal of this review is to incorporate these new findings with literature data and discuss future directions for improved understanding of EBV-induced antitumor immunity, as well as the hopes for rational immune strategies for cancer prevention and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vimentin inhibits type I interferon production by disrupting the TBK1-IKKε-IRF3 axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytoskeleton proteins have been reported to be involved in the host antiviral immune responses. However, how cytoskeleton proteins regulate host antiviral immune responses is not fully understood. Here we report that the cytoskeletal protein vimentin is a negative regulator of type I interferon (IFN-I) production upon viral infection. Ectopic expression of vimentin suppresses RNA- and DNA viruses-induced IFN-I production, whereas knockout of vimentin expression enhances IFN-I production. Viral infection increases vimentin expression and ultimately inhibits IFN-I production. Mechanistically, upregulated vimentin interacts with TBK1 and IKKε to disrupt the interactions of TBK1-IRF3 and IKKε-IRF3, resulting in inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, we generate vimentin knockout mice to confirm that deficiency of vimentin gene in mice suppressed encephalomyocarditis virus replication in vivo. Our findings demonstrates that vimentin plays an important role in regulating IFN-I production, revealing its antiviral function of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The E3 ubiquitin ligase ARIH1 promotes antiviral immunity and autoimmunity by inducing mono-ISGylation and oligomerization of cGAS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36217001/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) plays a critical role in antiviral immunity and autoimmunity. The activity and stability of cGAS are fine-tuned by post-translational modifications. Here, we show that ariadne RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (ARIH1) catalyzes the mono-ISGylation and induces the oligomerization of cGAS, thereby promoting antiviral immunity and autoimmunity. Knockdown or knockout of ARIH1 significantly inhibits herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)- or cytoplasmic DNA-induced expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. Consistently, tamoxifen-treated ER-Cre;Arih1&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt; mice and Lyz2-Cre; Arih1&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt; mice are hypersensitive to HSV-1 infection compared with the controls. In addition, deletion of ARIH1 in myeloid cells alleviates the autoimmune phenotypes and completely rescues the autoimmune lethality caused by TREX1 deficiency. Mechanistically, HSV-1- or cytosolic DNA-induced oligomerization and activation of cGAS are potentiated by ISGylation at its K187 residue, which is catalyzed by ARIH1. Our findings thus reveal an important role of ARIH1 in innate antiviral and autoimmune responses and provide insight into the post-translational regulation of cGAS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>miRNA let-7 family regulated by NEAT1 and ARID3A/NF-κB inhibits PRRSV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36215225/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically devastating diseases affecting the swine industry worldwide. To investigate the role of miRNAs in the infection and susceptibility of PRRS virus (PRRSV), twenty-four miRNA libraries were constructed and sequenced from PRRSV-infected and mock-infected Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) of Meishan, Landrace, Pietrain and Qingping pigs at 9 hours post infection (hpi), 36 hpi, and 60 hpi. The let-7 family miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between PRRSV-infected and mock-infected PAMs from 4 pig breeds. The let-7 family miRNAs could significantly inhibit PRRSV-2 replication by directly targeting the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR of the PRRSV-2 genome and porcine IL6, which plays an important role in PRRSV replication and lung injury. NEAT1 acts as a competing endogenous lncRNA (ceRNA) to upregulate IL6 by attaching let-7 in PAMs. EMSA and ChIP results confirmed that ARID3A could bind to the promoter region of pri-let-7a/let-7f/let-7d gene cluster and inhibit the expression of the let-7 family. Moreover, the NF-κB signaling pathway inhibits the expression of the let-7 family by affecting the nuclear import of ARID3A. The pEGFP-N1-let-7 significantly reduced viral infections and pathological changes in PRRSV-infected piglets. Taken together, NEAT1/ARID3A/let-7/IL6 play significant roles in PRRSV-2 infection and may be promising therapeutic targets for PRRS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular responses to influenza A virus (IAV) infections vary between mammalian species. To identify conserved and species-specific molecular responses, we perform a comparative study of transcriptomic data derived from blood cells, primary epithelial cells, and lung tissues collected from IAV-infected humans, ferrets, and mice. The molecular responses in the human host have unique functions such as antigen processing that are not observed in mice or ferrets. Highly conserved gene coexpression modules across the three species are enriched for IAV infection-induced pathways including cell cycle and interferon (IFN) signaling. TDRD7 is predicted as an IFN-inducible host factor that is up-regulated upon IAV infection in the three species. TDRD7 is required for antiviral IFN response, potentially modulating IFN signaling via the JAK/STAT/IRF9 pathway. Identification of the common and species-specific molecular signatures, networks, and regulators of IAV infection provides insights into host-defense mechanisms and will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic interventions against IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T cell activation and function depend on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals mediated by store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE) through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release-activated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (CRAC) channels formed by ORAI1 proteins. We here investigated how SOCE controls T cell function in pulmonary inflammation during a T helper 1 (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1) cell-mediated response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation. T cell-specific deletion of &lt;em&gt;Orai1&lt;/em&gt; did not exacerbate pulmonary inflammation and viral burdens following IAV infection but protected mice from house dust mite-induced allergic airway inflammation. ORAI1 controlled the expression of genes including p53 and E2F transcription factors that regulate the cell cycle in T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells in response to allergen stimulation and the expression of transcription factors and cytokines that regulate T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell function. Systemic application of a CRAC channel blocker suppressed allergic airway inflammation without compromising immunity to IAV infection, suggesting that inhibition of SOCE is a potential treatment for allergic airway disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The human disease gene LYSET is essential for lysosomal enzyme transport and viral infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lysosomes are key degradative compartments of the cell. Transport to lysosomes relies on GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase-mediated tagging of soluble enzymes with mannose 6-phosphate (M6P). GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase deficiency leads to the severe lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis II (MLII). Several viruses require lysosomal cathepsins to cleave structural proteins and thus depend on functional GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. We used genome-scale CRISPR screens to identify lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor (LYSET, also named TMEM251) as essential for infection by cathepsin-dependent viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). LYSET deficiency resulted in global loss of M6P tagging and mislocalization of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase from the Golgi complex to lysosomes. &lt;em&gt;Lyset&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice exhibited MLII-like phenotypes, and human pathogenic LYSET alleles failed to restore lysosomal sorting defects. Thus, LYSET is required for correct functioning of the M6P trafficking machinery and mutations in LYSET can explain the phenotype of the associated disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 disrupts host epigenetic regulation via histone mimicry</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged at the end of 2019 and caused the devastating global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in part because of its ability to effectively suppress host cell responses. In rare cases, viral proteins dampen antiviral responses by mimicking critical regions of human histone proteins, particularly those containing post-translational modifications required for transcriptional regulation. Recent work has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 markedly disrupts host cell epigenetic regulation. However, how SARS-CoV-2 controls the host cell epigenome and whether it uses histone mimicry to do so remain unclear. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 protein encoded by ORF8 (ORF8) functions as a histone mimic of the ARKS motifs in histone H3 to disrupt host cell epigenetic regulation. ORF8 is associated with chromatin, disrupts regulation of critical histone post-translational modifications and promotes chromatin compaction. Deletion of either the ORF8 gene or the histone mimic site attenuates the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to disrupt host cell chromatin, affects the transcriptional response to infection and attenuates viral genome copy number. These findings demonstrate a new function of ORF8 and a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 disrupts host cell epigenetic regulation. Further, this work provides a molecular basis for the finding that SARS-CoV-2 lacking ORF8 is associated with decreased severity of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influenza A virus infection instructs hematopoiesis to megakaryocyte-lineage output</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IAV infection transiently activates CD41+ HSCs, while EPCR+ CD41− HSCs remain quiescent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD41+ HSCs produce megakaryocytes in IAV-induced emergency megakaryopoiesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platelets generated by IAV-induced emergency megakaryopoiesis are pro-coagulant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IAV-induced emergency megakaryopoiesis is attenuated in IL1R1-deficient mice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory tract infections are among the deadliest communicable diseases worldwide. Severe cases of viral lung infections are often associated with a cytokine storm and alternating platelet numbers. We report that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) sense a non-systemic influenza A virus (IAV) infection via inflammatory cytokines. Irrespective of antiviral treatment or vaccination, at a certain threshold of IAV titer in the lung, CD41-positive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) enter the cell cycle while endothelial protein C receptor-positive CD41-negative HSCs remain quiescent. Active CD41-positive HSCs represent the source of megakaryocytes, while their multi-lineage reconstitution potential is reduced. This emergency megakaryopoiesis is thrombopoietin independent and attenuated in IAV-infected interleukin-1 receptor-deficient mice. Newly produced platelets during IAV infection are immature and hyper-reactive. After viral clearance, HSC quiescence is re-established. Our study reveals that non-systemic viral respiratory infection has an acute impact on HSCs via inflammatory cytokines to counteract IAV-induced thrombocytopenia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NLRC5 restricts dengue virus infection by promoting the autophagic degradation of viral NS3 through E3 ligase CUL2 (cullin 2)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36126167/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NLRC5 has been reported to be involved in antiviral immunity; however, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the functional role of NLRC5 in the infection of a flavivirus, dengue virus (DENV). We found that the expression of NLRC5 was strongly induced by virus infection and IFNB or IFNG stimulation in different cell lines. Overexpression of NLRC5 remarkably suppressed DENV infection, whereas knockout of NLRC5 led to a significant increase in DENV infection. Mechanistic study revealed that NLRC5 interacted with the viral nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) protease domain and mediated degradation of NS3 through a ubiquitin-dependent selective macroautophagy/autophagy pathway. We demonstrated that NLRC5 recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL2 (cullin 2) to catalyze K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of the NS3 protease domain, which subsequently served as a recognition signal for cargo receptor TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Together, we have demonstrated that NLRC5 exerted an antiviral effect by mediating the degradation of a multifunctional protein of DENV, providing a novel antiviral signal axis of NLRC5-CUL2-NS3-TOLLIP. This study expands our understanding of the regulatory network of NLRC5 in the host defense against virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single cell analysis of PANoptosome cell death complexes through an expansion microscopy method</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36169732/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to infection or sterile insults, inflammatory programmed cell death is an essential component of the innate immune response to remove infected or damaged cells. PANoptosis is a unique innate immune inflammatory cell death pathway regulated by multifaceted macromolecular complexes called PANoptosomes, which integrate components from other cell death pathways. Growing evidence shows that PANoptosis can be triggered in many physiological conditions, including viral and bacterial infections, cytokine storms, and cancers. However, PANoptosomes at the single cell level have not yet been fully characterized. Initial investigations have suggested that key pyroptotic, apoptotic, and necroptotic molecules including the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC, apoptotic caspase-8 (CASP8), and necroptotic RIPK3 are conserved components of PANoptosomes. Here, we optimized an immunofluorescence procedure to probe the highly dynamic multiprotein PANoptosome complexes across various innate immune cell death-inducing conditions. We first identified and validated antibodies to stain endogenous mouse ASC, CASP8, and RIPK3, without residual staining in the respective knockout cells. We then assessed the formation of PANoptosomes across innate immune cell death-inducing conditions by monitoring the colocalization of ASC with CASP8 and/or RIPK3. Finally, we established an expansion microscopy procedure using these validated antibodies to image the organization of ASC, CASP8, and RIPK3 within the PANoptosome. This optimized protocol, which can be easily adapted to study other multiprotein complexes and other cell death triggers, provides confirmation of PANoptosome assembly in individual cells and forms the foundation for a deeper molecular understanding of the PANoptosome complex and PANoptosis to facilitate therapeutic targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Viral protease cleavage of MAVS in genetically modified mice with hepatitis A virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36152761/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Consistent with its relatively narrow host species range, hepatitis A virus (HAV) cannot infect C57BL/6 mice. However, in &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice with genetic deficiency of the innate immune signaling adaptor MAVS, HAV replicates robustly in the absence of disease. The HAV 3ABC protease cleaves MAVS in human cells, thereby disrupting virus-induced IFN responses, but it cannot cleave murine MAVS (mMAVS) due to sequence differences at the site of scission. Here, we sought to elucidate the role of 3ABC MAVS cleavage in determining HAV pathogenesis and host species range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we established two independent lineages of C57BL/6 mice with knock-in mutations altering two amino acids in mMAVS (&amp;lsquo;mMAVS-VS&amp;rsquo;), rendering it susceptible to 3ABC cleavage without loss of signaling function. We challenged homozygous &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;vs/vs&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice with HAV, and compared infection outcomes with C57BL/6 and genetically deficient &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The humanized murine mMAVS-VS protein was cleaved as efficiently as human MAVS when co-expressed with 3ABC in Huh-7 cells. In embyronic fibroblasts from &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;vs/vs&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, mMAVS-VS was cleaved by ectopically expressed 3ABC, significantly disrupting Sendai virus-induced IFN responses. However, in contrast to &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice with genetic MAVS deficiency, HAV failed to establish infection in &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;vs/vs&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, even with additional genetic knockout of &lt;em&gt;Trif&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Irf1&lt;/em&gt;. Nonetheless, when crossed with permissive &lt;em&gt;Ifnar1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice lacking type I IFN receptors, &lt;em&gt;Mavs&lt;sup&gt;vs/vs&lt;/sup&gt;Ifnar1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice demonstrated enhanced viral replication coupled with significant reductions in serum alanine aminotransferase, hepatocellular apoptosis, and intrahepatic inflammatory cell infiltrates compared with &lt;em&gt;Ifnar1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; MAVS cleavage by 3ABC boosts viral replication and disrupts disease pathogenesis, but it is not by itself sufficient to break the host-species barrier to HAV infection in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Impact and implications:&lt;/em&gt; The limited host range of human hepatitis viruses could be explained by species-specific viral strategies that disrupt innate immune responses. Both hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis C virus express viral proteases that cleave the innate immune adaptor protein MAVS, in human but not mouse cells. However, the impact of this immune evasion strategy has never been assessed in vivo. Here we show that HAV 3ABC protease cleavage of MAVS enhances viral replication and lessens liver inflammation in mice lacking interferon receptors, but that it is insufficient by itself to overcome the cross-species barrier to infection in mice. These results enhance our understanding of how hepatitis viruses interact with the host and their impact on innate immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses exploit host cell machinery to support their replication. Defining the cellular proteins and processes required for a virus during infection is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of virally induced disease and designing host-directed therapeutics. Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screening in lung epithelial cells infected with the PR/8/NS1-GFP virus and use GFPhi cell as a unique screening marker to identify host factors that inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We discovered that APOE affects influenza virus infection both in vitro and in vivo. Cell deficiency in APOE conferred substantially increased susceptibility to IAV; mice deficient in APOE manifested more severe lung pathology, increased virus load, and decreased survival rate. Mechanistically, lack of cell-produced APOE results in impaired cell cholesterol homeostasis, enhancing influenza virus attachment. Thus, we identified a previously unrecognized role of APOE in restraining IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;HIV preferentially localizes to lymphoid aggregates, mediating submucosal virus entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HIV rapidly alters cellular spatial organization to maximize uptake and infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial immune response to HIV determines transmission. However, due to technical limitations we still do not have a comparative map of early mucosal transmission events. By combining RNAscope, cyclic immunofluorescence, and image analysis tools, we quantify HIV transmission signatures in intact human colorectal explants within 2 h of topical exposure. We map HIV enrichment to mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) and submucosal macrophages, but not CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, the primary targets of downstream infection. HIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs accumulate near and within lymphoid aggregates, which act as early sanctuaries of high viral titers while facilitating HIV passage to the submucosa. Finally, HIV entry induces recruitment and clustering of target cells, facilitating DC- and macrophage-mediated HIV transfer and enhanced infection of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. These data demonstrate a rapid response to HIV structured to maximize the likelihood of mucosal infection and provide a framework for in situ studies of host-pathogen interactions and immune-mediated pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFN-γ transforms the transcriptomic landscape and triggers myeloid cell hyperresponsiveness to cause lethal lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36203588/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory disease that is associated with high mortality but no specific treatment. Our understanding of initial events that trigger ARDS pathogenesis is limited. We have developed a mouse model of inflammatory lung injury by influenza and methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) coinfection plus daily antibiotic therapy. Using this pneumonic ARDS model, here we show that IFN-γ receptor signaling drives inflammatory cytokine storm and lung tissue damage. By single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, we demonstrate that IFN-γ signaling induces a transcriptional shift in airway immune cells, particularly by upregulating macrophage and monocyte expression of genes associated with inflammatory diseases. Further evidence from conditional knockout mouse models reveals that IFN-γ receptor signaling in myeloid cells, particularly CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mononuclear phagocytes, directly promotes TNF-α hyperproduction and inflammatory lung damage. Collectively, the findings from this study, ranging from cell-intrinsic gene expression to overall disease outcome, demonstrate that influenza-induced IFN-γ triggers myeloid cell hyperresponsiveness to MRSA, thereby leading to excessive inflammatory response and lethal lung damage during coinfection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protease-activated receptor 2 promotes clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection by inducing cAMP-Rac1 signaling in alveolar macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36204227/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient phagocytosis of pathogens by the innate immune system during infectious injury is vital for restoring tissue integrity. Impaired phagocytosis, such as in the case of infection with &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, a broad-spectrum antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterium, can lead to a life threatening lung disorder, acute lung injury (ALI). Evidence indicates that loss of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) impaired &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; clearance leading to non-resolvable ALI, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we focused on the alveolar macrophages (AMs), the predominant population of lung-resident macrophages involved in sensing bacteria, to understand their role in PAR2-mediated phagocytosis of &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. We found that upon binding &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, PAR2-expressing but not PAR2-null AMs had increased cAMP levels, which activated Rac1 through protein kinase A. Activated Rac1 increased actin-rich protrusions to augment the phagocytosis of &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. Administration of liposomes containing constitutively active Rac1 into PAR2-null mice lungs rescued phagocytosis and enhanced the survival of PAR2-null mice from pneumonia. These studies showed that PAR2 drives the cAMP-Rac1 signaling cascade that activates &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; phagocytosis in AMs, thereby preventing death from bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vimentin inhibits α-tubulin acetylation via enhancing α-TAT1 degradation to suppress the replication of human parainfluenza virus type 3</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36108090/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We previously found that, among human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) proteins, the interaction of nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) provides the minimal requirement for the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs), which are sites of RNA synthesis, and that acetylated α-tubulin enhances IB fusion and viral replication. In this study, using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry assays, we determined that vimentin (VIM) specifically interacted with the N-P complex of HPIV3, and that the head domain of VIM was responsible for this interaction, contributing to the inhibition of IB fusion and viral replication. Furthermore, we found that VIM promoted the degradation of α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (α-TAT1), through its head region, thereby inhibiting the acetylation of α-tubulin, IB fusion, and viral replication. In addition, we identified a 20-amino-acid peptide derived from the head region of VIM that participated in the interaction with the N-P complex and inhibited viral replication. Our findings suggest that VIM inhibits the formation of HPIV3 IBs by downregulating α-tubulin acetylation via enhancing the degradation of α-TAT1. Our work sheds light on a new mechanism by which VIM suppresses HPIV3 replication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Highly pathogenic coronavirus N protein aggravates inflammation by MASP-2-mediated lectin complement pathway overactivation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammatory responses contribute to the pathogenesis and lethality of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the N proteins of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), were found to bind MASP-2, a key serine protease in the lectin pathway of complement activation, resulting in excessive complement activation by potentiating MBL-dependent MASP-2 activation, and the deposition of MASP-2, C4b, activated C3 and C5b-9. Aggravated inflammatory lung injury was observed in mice infected with adenovirus expressing the N protein. Complement hyperactivation was also observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Either blocking the N protein:MASP-2 interaction, MASP-2 depletion or suppressing complement activation can significantly alleviate N protein-induced complement hyperactivation and lung injury in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, these data suggested that complement suppression may represent a novel therapeutic approach for pneumonia induced by these highly pathogenic coronaviruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structural and functional characterization of NEMO cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36075915/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its essential role in viral polyprotein processing, the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CLpro) can cleave human immune signaling proteins, like NF-κB Essential Modulator (NEMO) and deregulate the host immune response. Here, in vitro assays show that SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro cleaves NEMO with fine-tuned efficiency. Analysis of the 2.50 Å resolution crystal structure of 3CLpro C145S bound to NEMO&lt;sub&gt;226-234&lt;/sub&gt; reveals subsites that tolerate a range of viral and host substrates through main chain hydrogen bonds while also enforcing specificity using side chain hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. Machine learning- and physics-based computational methods predict that variation in key binding residues of 3CLpro-NEMO helps explain the high fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. We posit that cleavage of NEMO is an important piece of information to be accounted for, in the pathology of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>H1N1 influenza virus dose dependent induction of dysregulated innate immune responses and STAT1/3 activation are associated with pulmonary immunopathological damage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infection poses a substantial challenge and causes high morbidity and mortality. Exacerbated pulmonary inflammatory responses are the major causes of extensive diffuse alveolar immunopathological damage. However, the relationship between the extent of cytokine storm, neutrophils/macrophages infiltration, and different IAV infection dose and time still needs to be further elucidated, and it is still unclear whether the signal transduction and transcriptional activator 1/3 (STAT1/3) signalling pathway plays a beneficial or detrimental role. Here, we established a mouse model of high- and low-dose pH1N1 infection. We found that pH1N1 infection induced robust and early pathological damage and cytokine storm in an infection dose- and time-dependent manner. High-dose pH1N1 infection induced massive and sustained recruitment of neutrophils as well as a higher ratio of M1:M2, which may contribute to severe lung immunopathological damage. pH1N1 infection activated dose- and time-dependent STAT1 and STAT3. Inhibition of STAT1 and/or STAT3 aggravated low-dose pH1N1 infection, induced lung damage, and decreased survival rate. Appropriate activation of STAT1/3 provided survival benefits and pathological improvement during low-dose pH1N1 infection. These results demonstrate that high-dose pH1N1 infection induces robust and sustained neutrophil infiltration, imbalanced macrophage polarization, excessive and earlier cytokine storm, and STAT1/3 activation, which are associated with pulmonary dysregulated proinflammatory responses and progress of acute lung injury. The severe innate immune responses may be the threshold at which protective functions give way to immunopathology, and assessing the magnitude of host innate immune responses is necessary in adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy for alleviating influenza-induced pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Host Immune Responses to Arthritogenic Alphavirus Infection, with Emphasis on Type I IFN Responses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as Ross River virus, chikungunya virus and O’nyong-nyong virus, cause endemic disease globally and are a major public health concern. The hallmarks of arthritogenic alphavirus disease are debilitating pain, and potentially chronic inflammation of the muscles, thus influencing quality of life. The type I IFN response is a major component of the innate immune response against arthritogenic alphaviruses, and is essential in inhibiting viral replication and dissemination. Type I IFNs are induced during early stages of infection and are essential for the activation of the antiviral innate immune response. They also link the innate immune response and the activation of adaptive immunity. This review focuses on the host immune response, particularly that involving type I IFN, in arthritogenic alphavirus disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transient RNA structures cause aberrant influenza virus replication and innate immune activation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During infection, the influenza A virus RNA polymerase produces both full-length and aberrant RNA molecules, such as defective viral genomes (DVGs) and mini viral RNAs (mvRNAs). Subsequent innate immune activation involves the binding of host pathogen receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) to viral RNAs. However, it is not clear what factors determine which influenza A virus RNAs are RIG-I agonists. Here, we provide evidence that RNA structures, called template loops (t-loops), stall the viral RNA polymerase and contribute to innate immune activation by mvRNAs during influenza A virus infection. Impairment of replication by t-loops depends on the formation of an RNA duplex near the template entry and exit channels of the RNA polymerase, and this effect is enhanced by mutation of the template exit path from the RNA polymerase active site. Overall, these findings are suggestive of a mechanism involving polymerase stalling that links aberrant viral replication to the activation of the innate immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Injury-induced pulmonary tuft cells are heterogenous, arise independent of key Type 2 cytokines, and are dispensable for dysplastic repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36073526/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the lung bears significant regenerative capacity, severe viral pneumonia can chronically impair lung function by triggering dysplastic remodeling. The connection between these enduring changes and chronic disease remains poorly understood. We recently described the emergence of tuft cells within Krt5+ dysplastic regions after influenza injury. Using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, we characterized and delineated multiple distinct tuft cell populations that arise following influenza clearance. Distinct from intestinal tuft cells which rely on Type 2 immune signals for their expansion, neither IL-25 nor IL-4ra signaling are required to drive tuft cell development in dysplastic/injured lungs. In addition, tuft cell expansion occurred independently of type I or type III interferon signaling. Furthermore, tuft cells were also observed upon bleomycin injury, suggesting that their development may be a general response to severe lung injury. While intestinal tuft cells promote growth and differentiation of surrounding epithelial cells, in the lungs of tuft cell deficient mice, Krt5+ dysplasia still occurs, goblet cell production is unchanged, and there remains no appreciable contribution of Krt5+ cells into more regionally appropriate alveolar Type 2 cells. Together, these findings highlight unexpected differences in signals necessary for murine lung tuft cell amplification and establish a framework for future elucidation of tuft cell functions in pulmonary health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal microbiota metabolizing Houttuynia cordata polysaccharides in H1N1 induced pneumonia mice contributed to Th17/Treg rebalance in gut-lung axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus is intricately linked to dysregulation of gut microbiota and host immunity. Previous study revealed that Houttuynia cordata polysaccharides (HCP) exert the therapeutic effect on influenza A virus inducing lung and intestine damage via regulating pulmonary and intestinal mucosal immunity. However, whether this result was due to the regulation of gut microbiota in the gut-lung axis remains unclear. Here, we firstly found that the elimination of gut microbiota using antibiotic cocktails led to both loss of the protective effect of HCP on intestine and lung injury, and reduction of the efficacy on regulating Th17/Treg balance in gut-lung axis. Fecal microbiota transplantation study confirmed that the gut microbiota fermented with HCP under pathological conditions (H1N1 infection) was responsible for reducing pulmonary and intestinal injury. Moreover, the interaction of HCP and gut microbiota under pathological conditions exhibited not only much more abundant gut microbial diversity, but also higher content of the acetate. Our results demonstrated that the underlying mechanism to ameliorate viral pneumonia in mice involving Th17/Treg rebalance via the gut microbiota and HCP metabolite (acetate) metabolized in pneumonia mice. Our results provided a new insight for macromolecular polysaccharides through targeting intestinal microenvironment reducing distant pulmonary infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Methionine metabolism controls the B cell EBV epigenome and viral latency</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36070681/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methionine metabolism is critical for Epstein-Barr virus B cell latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive crosstalk enables methionine metabolism to control the EBV epigenome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methionine restriction also impairs EBV-driven human B cell immortalization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dietary methionine restriction unmasks EBV antigens in Burkitt xenografts &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) subverts host epigenetic pathways to switch between viral latency programs, colonize the B cell compartment, and reactivate. Within memory B cells, the reservoir for lifelong infection, EBV genomic DNA and histone methylation marks restrict gene expression. But this epigenetic strategy also enables EBV-infected tumors, including Burkitt lymphomas, to evade immune detection. Little is known about host cell metabolic pathways that support EBV epigenome landscapes. We therefore used amino acid restriction, metabolomic, and CRISPR approaches to identify that an abundant methionine supply and interconnecting methionine and folate cycles maintain Burkitt EBV gene silencing. Methionine restriction, or methionine cycle perturbation, hypomethylated EBV genomes and de-repressed latent membrane protein and lytic gene expression. Methionine metabolism also shaped EBV latency gene regulation required for B cell immortalization. Dietary methionine restriction altered murine Burkitt xenograft metabolomes and de-repressed EBV immunogens &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. These results highlight epigenetic/immunometabolism crosstalk supporting the EBV B cell life cycle and suggest therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections can compromise the physical and biological functionalities of humans and pose a huge economical and psychological burden on infected patients. Nitric oxide (NO) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, whose mechanism of action is not affected by bacterial resistance. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an endogenous donor and carrier of NO, has gained increasing attention because of its potent antibacterial activity and efficient biocompatibility. Significant breakthroughs have been made in the application of GSNO in biomaterials. This review is based on the existing evidence that comprehensively summarizes the progress of antimicrobial GSNO applications focusing on their anti-infective performance, underlying antibacterial mechanisms, and application in anti-infective biomaterials. We provide an accurate overview of the roles and applications of GSNO in antibacterial biomaterials and shed new light on the avenues for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CLEC5A is critical in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced NET formation and acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36048544/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most common nosocomial infections worldwide, and it frequently causes ventilator-associated acute pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Abundant neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to acute lung injury, thereby aggravating ventilator-induced lung damage. While pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) TLR4 and TLR5 are required for host defense against &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; invasion, the PRR responsible for &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced NET formation, proinflammatory cytokine release, and acute lung injury remains unclear. We found that myeloid C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A) interacts with LPS of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; and is responsible for &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced NET formation and lung inflammation. &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; activates CLEC5A to induce caspase-1-dependent NET formation, but it neither causes gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage nor contributes to &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced neutrophil death. Blockade of CLEC5A attenuates &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced NETosis and lung injury, and simultaneous administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb with ciprofloxacin increases survival rate and decreases collagen deposition in the lungs of mice challenged with a lethal dose of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, CLEC5A is a promising therapeutic target to reduce ventilator-associated lung injury and fibrosis in &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel Requirement for Staphylococcal Cell Wall-Anchored Protein SasD in Pulmonary Infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; can complicate preceding viral infections, including influenza virus. A bacterial infection combined with a preceding viral infection, known as superinfection, leads to worse outcomes than a single infection. Most of the pulmonary infection literature focuses on the changes in immune responses to bacteria between homeostatic and virally infected lungs. However, it is unclear how much of an influence bacterial virulence factors have in single or superinfection. Staphylococcal species express a broad range of cell wall-anchored proteins (CWAs) that have roles in host adhesion, nutrient acquisition, and immune evasion. We screened the importance of these CWAs using mutants lacking individual CWAs in vivo in both bacterial pneumonia and influenza superinfection. In bacterial pneumonia, the lack of individual CWAs leads to various decreases in bacterial burden, lung damage, and immune infiltration into the lung. However, the presence of a preceding influenza infection partially abrogates the requirement for CWAs. In the screen, we found that the uncharacterized CWA &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; surface protein D (SasD) induced changes in both inflammatory and homeostatic lung markers. We further characterized a SasD mutant (sasD A50.1) in the context of pneumonia. Mice infected with sasD A50.1 have decreased bacterial burden, inflammatory responses, and mortality compared to wild-type &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;. Mice also have reduced levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), likely derived from macrophages. Reductions in IL-1β transcript levels as well as increased macrophage viability point at differences in cell death pathways. These data identify a novel virulence factor for &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; that influences inflammatory signaling within the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; is a common commensal bacterium that can cause severe infections, such as pneumonia. In the lung, viral infections increase the risk of staphylococcal pneumonia, leading to combined infections known as superinfections. The most common virus associated with &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; pneumonia is influenza, and superinfections lead to worse patient outcomes than either infection alone. While there is much known about how the immune system differs between healthy and virally infected lungs, the role of bacterial virulence factors in single and superinfection is less understood. The significance of our research is identifying bacterial components that play a role in the initiation of lung injury, which could lead to future therapies to prevent pulmonary single or superinfection with &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time-resolved single-cell sequencing captures early host-EBV dynamics in B cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A refined germinal center model of EBV infection is validated by tonsil scRNA-seq&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBV-induced mimicry of a pre-GC AP-eMBC state is identified and validated in vitro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBV &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; infection yields non-canonical gene expression in TBX21&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; memory B cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epstein-Barr virus infection of B lymphocytes elicits diverse host responses via well-adapted transcriptional control dynamics. Consequently, this host-pathogen interaction provides a powerful system to explore fundamental processes leading to consensus fate decisions. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics to construct a genome-wide multistate model of B cell fates upon EBV infection. Additional single-cell data from human tonsils reveal correspondence of model states to analogous &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; phenotypes within secondary lymphoid tissue, including an EBV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; analog of multipotent activated precursors that can yield early memory B cells. These resources yield exquisitely detailed perspectives of the transforming cellular landscape during an oncogenic viral infection that simulates antigen-induced B cell activation and differentiation. Thus, they support investigations of state-specific EBV-host dynamics, effector B cell fates, and lymphomagenesis. To demonstrate this potential, we identify EBV infection dynamics in FCRL4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/TBX21&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; atypical memory B cells that are pathogenically associated with numerous immune disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>sRNA-controlled iron sparing response in Staphylococci</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35904807/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;, a human opportunist pathogen, adjusts its metabolism to cope with iron deprivation within the host. We investigated the potential role of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) in dictating this process. A single sRNA, named here IsrR, emerged from a competition assay with tagged-mutant libraries as being required during iron starvation. IsrR is iron-repressed and predicted to target mRNAs expressing iron-containing enzymes. Among them, we demonstrated that IsrR down-regulates the translation of mRNAs of enzymes that catalyze anaerobic nitrate respiration. The IsrR sequence reveals three single-stranded C-rich regions (CRRs). Mutational and structural analysis indicated a differential contribution of these CRRs according to targets. We also report that IsrR is required for full lethality of &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; in a mouse septicemia model, underscoring its role as a major contributor to the iron-sparing response for bacterial survival during infection. IsrR is conserved among staphylococci, but it is not ortholog to the proteobacterial sRNA RyhB, nor to other characterized sRNAs down-regulating mRNAs of iron-containing enzymes. Remarkably, these distinct sRNAs regulate common targets, illustrating that RNA-based regulation provides optimal evolutionary solutions to improve bacterial fitness when iron is scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influenza virus causes lung immunopathology through down-regulating PPARγ activity in macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36091002/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatal influenza (flu) virus infection often activates excessive inflammatory signals, leading to multi-organ failure and death, also referred to as cytokine storm. PPARγ (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonists are well-known candidates for cytokine storm modulation. The present study identified that influenza infection reduced PPARγ expression and decreased PPARγ transcription activity in human alveolar macrophages (AMs) from different donors. Treatment with PPARγ agonist Troglitazone ameliorated virus-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion but did not interfere with the IFN-induced antiviral pathway in human AMs. In contrast, PPARγ antagonist and knockdown of PPARγ in human AMs further enhanced virus-stimulated proinflammatory response. In a mouse model of influenza infection, flu virus dose-dependently reduced PPARγ transcriptional activity and decreased expression of PPARγ. Moreover, PPARγ agonist troglitazone significantly reduced high doses of influenza infection-induced lung pathology. In addition, flu infection reduced PPARγ expression in all mouse macrophages, including AMs, interstitial macrophages, and bone-marrow-derived macrophages but not in alveolar epithelial cells. Our results indicate that the influenza virus specifically targets the PPARγ pathway in macrophages to cause acute injury to the lung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cephalosporins-induced intestinal dysbiosis exacerbated pulmonary endothelial barrier disruption in streptococcus pneumoniae-infected mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36093187/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic abuse is growing more severe in clinic, and even short-term antibiotic treatment can cause long-term gut dysbiosis, which may promote the development and aggravation of diseases. Cephalosporins as the broad-spectrum antibiotics are widely used for prevention and treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in children. However, their potential consequences in health and disease have not been fully elaborated. In this study, the effects of cefaclor, cefdinir and cefixime on intestinal microbiota and lung injury were investigated in &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; (Spn)-infected mice. The results showed that the proportion of coccus and bacillus in intestinal microbiota were changed after oral administration with cefaclor, cefdinir and cefixime twice for 10 days, respectively. Compared with the Spn-infected group, the proportion of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; in intestine were significantly reduced, while Enterococcus and Candida was increased after cephalosporin treatment. Furthermore, 3 cephalosporins could obviously increase the number of total cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes in BALF as well as the serum levels of endotoxin, IL-2, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Mechanically, cephalosporins accelerated Spn-induced pulmonary barrier dysfunction via mediating the mRNA expressions of endothelial barrier-related proteins (Claudin 5, Occludin, and ZO-1) and inflammation-related proteins (TLR4, p38 and NF-κB). However, all of those consequences could be partly reversed by &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium bifidum&lt;/em&gt; treatment, which was closely related to the elevated acetate production, indicating the protective effects of probiotic against antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that oral administration with cephalosporins not only disrupted intestinal microecological homeostasis, but also increased the risk of Spn infection, resulting in severer respiratory inflammation and higher bacterial loads in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long noncoding RNA CHROMR regulates antiviral immunity in humans</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36001732/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effective innate immune response to virus infection requires the induction of type I interferons and up-regulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that instruct antiviral functions and immune regulation. Deciphering the regulatory mechanisms that direct expression of the ISG network is critical for understanding the fundamental organization of the innate immune response and the development of antiviral therapies. We define a regulatory role for the primate-specific long noncoding RNA &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; in coordinating ISG transcription. &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; sequesters the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-2/IRF2BP2 complex that restrains ISG transcription and thus is required to restrict influenza virus replication. These data identify a novel regulator of the antiviral gene program in humans and provide insights into the multilayered regulatory network that controls the innate immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression, yet their contribution to immune regulation in humans remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the primate-specific lncRNA &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; is induced by influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection and coordinates the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that execute antiviral responses. &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; depletion in human macrophages reduces histone acetylation at regulatory regions of ISG loci and attenuates ISG expression in response to microbial stimuli. Mechanistically, we show that &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; sequesters the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-2-dependent transcriptional corepressor IRF2BP2, thereby licensing IRF-dependent signaling and transcription of the ISG network. Consequently, &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; expression is essential to restrict viral infection of macrophages. Our findings identify &lt;em&gt;CHROMR&lt;/em&gt; as a key arbitrator of antiviral innate immune signaling in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synergistic effect of low-frequency ultrasound and antibiotics on the treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36001465/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antibiotic-resistant &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; (Kp) has become a significant crisis in treating pneumonia. Low-frequency ultrasound (LFU) is promising to overcome the obstacles. Mice were infected with bioluminescent Kp Xen39 by intratracheal injection to study the therapeutic effect of LFU in combination with antibiotics. The counts per second (CPS) were assessed with an animal biophoton imaging system. Bacterial clearance, histopathology, and the concentrations of cytokines were determined to evaluate the therapeutic effect. LC-MS/MS was used to detect the distribution of antibiotics in the lung and plasma. LFU in combination with meropenem (MEM) or amikacin (AMK) significantly improved the behavioural state of mice. The CPS of the LFU combination group were more significantly decreased compared with those of the antibiotic alone groups. The average colony-forming units of lung tissue in the LFU combination groups were also lower than those of the antibiotic groups. Although no significant changes of cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were observed, LFU in combination with antibiotics showed less inflammatory damage from histopathological results compared with the antibiotic-alone groups. Moreover, 10 min of LFU treatment promoted the distribution of MEM and AMK in mouse lung tissue at 60 and 30 min, respectively, after dosage. LFU could enhance the effectiveness of MEM and AMK in the treatment of Kp-induced pneumonia, which might be attributed to the fact that LFU could promote the distribution of antibiotics in lung tissue and reduce inflammatory injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acteoside attenuates RSV-induced lung injury by suppressing necroptosis and regulating metabolism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36059973/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Necroptosis and inflammation are closely related to the pathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Acteoside (AC), a natural phenylpropanoid glycoside from Kuding Tea, has significant anti-RSV effect. However, the roles of AC on RSV-induced lung necroptosis and inflammation are yet to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The effects of AC were investigated in BALB/c mice and A549 cells. Lung histopathology was observed through H&amp;amp;E staining. The viral titer was assessed via plaque assay. The RSV-F expression was determined by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry assay. The levels of cytokines were detected by ELISA and RT-qPCR. The necroptosis rate and mitochondrial membrane potential were evaluated via flow cytometry. The expressions of HMGB1/NF-κB and RIP1/RIP3/MLKL/PGAM5/DRP1 were detected by western blot. Additionally, untargeted metabolomics was conducted to investigate the metabolic profiles and related metabolic pathways via Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that compared with the RSV-infected group, AC treatment significantly attenuated lung pathological damage, virus replication, and cytokines levels. AC also alleviated RSV-induced necroptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Moreover, AC treatment down-regulated the expression of HMGB1, p-Iκbα/Iκbα, p-p65/p65, RIP1, RIP3, MLKL, PGAM5, and DRP1. Furthermore, metabolomic analyses suggested that the perturbations in major metabolites of AC therapy were related to variations in amino acid and energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings validated the beneficial effects of AC in suppressing necroptosis and regulating metabolism, suggesting AC may be a new drug candidate for RSV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor Progression Locus 2 Protects against Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Influenza A Virus-Infected Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35980186/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35980186/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation in patients with severe influenza disease may lead to acute lung injury that results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is associated with alveolar damage and pulmonary edema that severely impair gas exchange, leading to hypoxia. With no existing FDA-approved treatment for ARDS, it is important to understand the factors that lead to virus-induced ARDS development to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We have previously shown that mice deficient in the serine-threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase, Tpl2 (MAP3K8 or COT), succumb to infection with a typically low-pathogenicity strain of influenza A virus (IAV; HKX31, H3N2 [x31]). The goal of the current study was to evaluate influenza A virus-infected &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice clinically and histopathologically to gain insight into the disease mechanism. We hypothesized that &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice succumb to IAV infection due to development of ARDS-like disease and pulmonary dysfunction. We observed prominent signs of alveolar septal necrosis, hyaline membranes, pleuritis, edema, and higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the lungs of IAV-infected &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice from 7 to 9 days postinfection (dpi). Notably, WT mice showed signs of regenerating epithelium, indicative of repair and recovery, that were reduced in &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Furthermore, biomarkers associated with human ARDS cases were upregulated in &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice at 7 dpi, demonstrating an ARDS-like phenotype in &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice in response to IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the protective role of the serine-threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase, Tpl2, in influenza virus pathogenesis and reveals that host Tpl2 deficiency is sufficient to convert a low-pathogenicity influenza A virus infection into severe influenza disease that resembles ARDS, both histopathologically and transcriptionally. The IAV-infected &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mouse thereby represents a novel murine model for studying ARDS-like disease that could improve our understanding of this aggressive disease and assist in the design of better diagnostics and treatments.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many respiratory viruses cause lung damage that may evolve into acute lung injury (ALI), a cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and ultimately, death. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) family of transcription factors, regulates transcription by forming heterodimers with another NHR family member, Retinoid X Receptor (RXR). Each component of the heterodimer binds specific ligands that modify transcriptional capacity of the entire heterodimer by recruiting different co-activators/co-repressors. However, the role of PPARγ/RXR ligands in the context of influenza infection is not well understood. PPARγ is associated with macrophage differentiation to an anti-inflammatory M2 state. We show that mice lacking the IL-4Rα receptor, required for M2a macrophage differentiation, are more susceptible to mouse-adapted influenza (A/PR/8/34; &amp;ldquo;PR8&amp;rdquo;)-induced lethality. Mice lacking &lt;em&gt;Ptgs2&lt;/em&gt;, that encodes COX-2, a key proinflammatory M1 macrophage mediator, are more resistant. Blocking the receptor for COX-2-induced Prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was also protective. Treatment with pioglitazone (PGZ), a PPARγ ligand, increased survival from PR8 infection, decreased M1 macrophage gene expression, and increased PPARγ mRNA in lungs. Conversely, conditional knockout mice expressing PPARγ-deficient macrophages were significantly more sensitive to PR8-induced lethality. These findings were extended in cotton rats: PGZ blunted lung inflammation and M1 cytokine gene expression after challenge with non-adapted human influenza. To study mechanisms by which PPARγ/RXR transcription factors induce canonical M2a genes, WT mouse macrophages were treated with IL-4 in the absence or presence of rosiglitazone (RGZ; PPARγ ligand), LG100754 (LG; RXR ligand), or both. IL-4 dose-dependently induced M2a genes &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chil3&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Retnla&lt;/em&gt;. Treatment of macrophages with IL-4 and RGZ and/or LG differentially affected induction of &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;Chil3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Retnla&lt;/em&gt; gene expression. In PPARγ-deficient macrophages, IL-4 alone failed to induce &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; gene expression; however, concurrent treatment with LG or RGZ + LG enhanced IL-4-induced &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; expression, but to a lower level than in WT macrophages, findings confirmed in the murine alveolar macrophage cell line, MH-S. These findings support a model in which PPARγ/RXR heterodimers control IL-4-induced M2a differentiation, and suggest that PPARγ/RXR agonists should be considered as important tools for clinical intervention against influenza-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNA circSFMBT2 downregulation by HBx promotes hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis via the miR-665/TIMP3 axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is considered as an oncogene in tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In recent years, the important role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in HCC has been increasingly demonstrated. However, the regulatory mechanisms of HBx on circRNAs remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified that a novel circRNA, circSFMBT2, was markedly downregulated by HBx. Low expression of circSFMBT2 was correlated with poor prognosis and vascular invasion. Functionally, overexpression of circSFMBT2 significantly inhibited HCC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of circSFMBT2 was to as a sponge of miR-665, which is a negative regulator of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3). However, HBx downregulated circSFMBT2 via the interaction with DExH-box helicase 9 (DHX9), which binds to flanking circRNA-forming introns. In conclusion, circSFMBT2, which is downregulated by HBx, acts as a tumor suppressor to inhibit tumor metastasis through the miR-665/TIMP3 axis. Our study suggests that circSFMBT2 could be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autoinducer-2 promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36033859/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that causes various acute and chronic lung infections in immunocompromised patients. We previously found that a quorum sensing (QS) signal, namely, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), facilitates the pathogenicity of the wild-type (WT) &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 strain &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. However, the immunological mechanism that leads to pulmonary injury remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of AI-2 on interleukin-17A (IL-17A) production during acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 lung infection using a mouse model, with an emphasis on the underlying immunological mechanism. Compared to infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 alone, infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 combined with AI-2 treatment resulted in significantly increased levels of IL-17A, numbers of Th17 cells and levels of STAT3 in the lung tissues of WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), as well as more serious lung damage. In contrast, the concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and the chemokine keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) were significantly reduced during &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infection in IL-17A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and no effects were observed after AI-2 treatment (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the level of IL-17A in the lungs of WT mice was significantly reduced following infection with a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; strain harboring mutations in the QS genes &lt;em&gt;lasR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rhlR&lt;/em&gt; compared with the level of IL-17A following infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1. Our data suggest that AI-2 promotes &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway by interfering with the QS systems of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. IL-17A may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infections in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The retroelement Lx9 puts a brake on the immune response to virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35948641/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that mobile units of nucleic acid known as transposable elements can operate as genomic controlling elements was put forward over six decades ago. However, it was not until the advancement of genomic sequencing technologies that the abundance and repertoire of transposable elements were revealed, and they are now known to constitute up to two-thirds of mammalian genomes. The presence of DNA regulatory regions including promoters, enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites within transposable elements has led to the hypothesis that transposable elements have been co-opted to regulate mammalian gene expression and cell phenotype. Mammalian transposable elements include recent acquisitions and ancient transposable elements that have been maintained in the genome over evolutionary time. The presence of ancient conserved transposable elements correlates positively with the likelihood of a regulatory function, but functional validation remains an essential step to identify transposable element insertions that have a positive effect on fitness. Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of a transposable element-namely the LINE-1 retrotransposon Lx9c11-in mice results in an exaggerated and lethal immune response to virus infection. Lx9c11 is critical for the neogenesis of a non-coding RNA (Lx9c11-RegoS) that regulates genes of the Schlafen family, reduces the hyperinflammatory phenotype and rescues lethality in virus-infected Lx9c11-/- mice. These findings provide evidence that a transposable element can control the immune system to favour host survival during virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Erythropoietin mediates re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages through PI3K/AKT signaling and protects mice against secondary infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016936/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure leads to a hypo-responsive state by macrophages to a secondary stimulation of LPS, known as endotoxin tolerance. However, recent findings show that functions of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages are not completely suppressed, whereas they undergo a functional re-programming process with upregulation of a panel of molecules leading to enhanced protective functions including antimicrobial and tissue-remodeling activities. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), exerts anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective activities. Nevertheless, the potential effects of EPO on functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages have not been investigated yet. Here, we found that initial LPS exposure led to upregulation of HIF-1α/EPO in macrophages and that EPO enhanced tolerance in tolerized macrophages and mice as demonstrated by suppressed proinflammatory genes such as &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; after secondary LPS stimulation. Moreover, we showed that EPO improved host protective genes in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages and mice, such as the anti-bacterial genes coding for cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (&lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;) and macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (&lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;), and the tissue-repairing gene vascular endothelial growth factor C (&lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;). Therefore, our findings indicate that EPO mediates the functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages. Mechanistically, we found that PI3K/AKT signaling contributed to EPO-mediated re-programming through upregulation of &lt;em&gt;Irak3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wdr5&lt;/em&gt; expression. Specifically, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK3) was responsible for inhibiting proinflammatory genes &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; in tolerized macrophages after LPS rechallenge, whereas WDR5 contributed to the upregulation of host beneficial genes including &lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;. In a septic model of mice, EPO pretreatment significantly promoted endotoxin-tolerant re-programming, alleviated lung injury, enhanced bacterial clearance, and decreased mortality in LPS-tolerized mice after secondary infection of &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;. Collectively, our results reveal a novel role for EPO in mediating functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages; thus, targeting EPO appears to be a new therapeutic option in sepsis and other inflammatory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dysregulation of the kallikrein-kinin system in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with severe COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35939907/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a critical component of the kallikrein-kinin system. Its dysregulation may lead to increased vascular permeability and release of inflammatory chemokines. Interactions between the kallikrein-kinin and the coagulation system might further contribute to thromboembolic complications in COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this observational study, we measured plasma and tissue kallikrein hydrolytic activity, levels of kinin peptides, and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA complexes as a biomarker for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with and without COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Findings:&lt;/em&gt; In BAL fluid from patients with severe COVID-19 (n = 21, of which 19 were mechanically ventilated), we observed higher tissue kallikrein activity (18·2 pM [1·2-1535·0], median [range], n = 9 vs 3·8 [0·0-22·0], n = 11; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0·030), higher levels of the kinin peptide bradykinin-(1-5) (89·6 [0·0-2425·0], n = 21 vs 0·0 [0·0-374·0], n = 19, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0·001), and higher levels of MPO-DNA complexes (699·0 ng/mL [66·0-142621·0], n = 21 vs 70·5 [9·9-960·0], n = 19, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0·001) compared to patients without COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/em&gt; Our observations support the hypothesis that dysregulation of the kallikrein-kinin system might occur in mechanically ventilated patients with severe pulmonary disease, which might help to explain the clinical presentation of patients with severe COVID-19 developing pulmonary oedema and thromboembolic complications. Therefore, targeting the kallikrein-kinin system should be further explored as a potential treatment option for patients with severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Streptococcal autolysin promotes dysfunction of swine tracheal epithelium by interacting with vimentin</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a major zoonotic pathogen resulting in manifestations as pneumonia and septic shock. The upper respiratory tract is typically thought to be the main colonization and entry site of SS2 in pigs, but the mechanism through which it penetrates the respiratory barrier is still unclear. In this study, a mutant with low invasive potential to swine tracheal epithelial cells (STECs) was screened from the TnYLB-1 transposon insertion mutant library of SS2, and the interrupted gene was identified as autolysin (atl). Compared to wild-type (WT) SS2, Δatl mutant exhibited lower ability to penetrate the tracheal epithelial barrier in a mouse model. Purified Atl also enhanced SS2 translocation across STEC monolayers in Transwell inserts. Furthermore, Atl redistributed the tight junctions (TJs) in STECs through myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) signaling, which led to increased barrier permeability. Using mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), pull-down, bacterial two-hybrid and saturation binding experiments, we showed that Atl binds directly to vimentin. CRISPR/Cas9-targeted deletion of vimentin in STECs (VIM KO STECs) abrogated the capacity of SS2 to translocate across the monolayers, SS2-induced phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) and MLCK transcription, indicating that vimentin is indispensable for MLCK activation. Consistently, vimentin null mice were protected from SS2 infection and exhibited reduced tracheal and lung injury. Thus, MLCK-mediated epithelial barrier opening caused by the Atl-vimentin interaction is found to be likely the key mechanism by which SS2 penetrates the tracheal epithelium.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cysteinyl Maresins Reprogram Macrophages to Protect Mice from Streptococcus pneumoniae after Influenza A Virus Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35913160/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Excess mortality during IAV epidemics and pandemics is attributable to secondary bacterial infections, particularly pneumonia caused by &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;. Resident alveolar macrophages (rAMs) are early responders to respiratory infections that coordinate initial host defense responses. Maresin conjugates in tissue regeneration (MCTRs) are recently elucidated cysteinyl maresins that are produced by and act on macrophages. Roles for MCTRs in responses to respiratory infections remain to be determined. Here, IAV infection led to transient decreases in rAM numbers. Repopulated lung macrophages displayed transcriptional alterations 21 days post-IAV with prolonged susceptibility to secondary pneumococcal infection. Administration of a mix of MCTR1 to 3 or MCTR3 alone post-IAV decreased lung inflammation and bacterial load 48 and 72 h after secondary pneumococcal infection. MCTR-exposed rAMs had increased migration and phagocytosis of &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, reduced secretion of CXCL1, and a reversion toward baseline levels of several IAV-induced pneumonia susceptibility genes. Together, MCTRs counter regulated post-IAV changes in rAMs to promote a rapid return of bacteria host defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a serious and common complication of IAV infection, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. New host-directed approaches are needed to complement antibiotics to better address this important global infectious disease. Here, we show that harnessing endogenous resolution mechanisms for inflammation by exogenous administration of a family of specialized proresolving mediators (i.e., cys-MCTRs) increased macrophage resilience mechanisms after IAV to protect against secondary infection from &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; To determine if systemic immune alterations and lung replication of herpesviridae are associated and can help predict outcomes after brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with severe brain injury requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. We systematically searched for respiratory herpes simplex virus (HSV) replications in tracheal aspirates. We also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and in vitro functional assays of monocytes and CD4 T cells collected on Day 1 to characterize the immune response to severe acute brain injury. The primary outcome was the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/em&gt; In 344 patients with severe brain injury, lung HSV reactivations were observed in 39% of the 232 patients seropositive for HSV and independently associated with poor neurological recovery at 6 months (hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.57). Weighted gene coexpression network analyses of the transcriptomic response of monocytes to brain injury defined a module of 721 genes, including PD-L1 and CD80, enriched for the binding DNA motif of the transcriptional factor Zeb2 and whose ontogenic analyses revealed decreased IFN-γ-mediated and antiviral response signaling pathways. This monocyte signature was preserved in a validation cohort and predicted the neurological outcome at 6 months with good accuracy (area under the curve, 0.786; 95% confidence interval, 0.593-0.978).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; A specific monocyte signature is associated with HSV reactivation and predicts poor recovery after brain injury. The alterations of the immune control of herpesviridae replication are understudied and represent a novel therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epithelial HVEM maintains intraepithelial T cell survival and contributes to host protection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intraepithelial T cells (IETs) are in close contact with intestinal epithelial cells and the underlying basement membrane, and they detect invasive pathogens. How intestinal epithelial cells and basement membrane influence IET survival and function, at steady state or after infection, is unclear. The herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, is constitutively expressed by intestinal epithelial cells and is important for protection from pathogenic bacteria. Here, we showed that at steady-state LIGHT, an HVEM ligand, binding to epithelial HVEM promoted the survival of small intestine IETs. RNA-seq and addition of HVEM ligands to epithelial organoids indicated that HVEM increased epithelial synthesis of basement membrane proteins, including collagen IV, which bound to β1 integrins expressed by IETs. Therefore, we proposed that IET survival depended on β1 integrin binding to collagen IV and showed that β1 integrin-collagen IV interactions supported IET survival in vitro. Moreover, the absence of β1 integrin expression by T lymphocytes decreased TCR αβ+ IETs in vivo. Intravital microscopy showed that the patrolling movement of IETs was reduced without epithelial HVEM. As likely consequences of decreased number and movement, protective responses to Salmonella enterica were reduced in mice lacking either epithelial HVEM, HVEM ligands, or β1 integrins. Therefore, IETs, at steady state and after infection, depended on HVEM expressed by epithelial cells for the synthesis of collagen IV by epithelial cells. Collagen IV engaged β1 integrins on IETs that were important for their maintenance and for their protective function in mucosal immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PEtOxylated Interferon-α2a Bioconjugates Addressing H1N1 Influenza A Virus Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35904477/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A viruses (IAV), including the pandemic 2009 (pdm09) H1N1 or avian influenza H5N1 virus, may advance into more pathogenic, potentially antiviral drug-resistant strains (including loss of susceptibility against oseltamivir). Such IAV strains fuel the risk of future global outbreaks, to which this study responds by re-engineering Interferon-α2a (IFN-α2a) bioconjugates into influenza therapeutics. Type-I interferons such as IFN-α2a play an essential role in influenza infection and may prevent serious disease courses. We site-specifically conjugated a genetically engineered IFN-α2a mutant to poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)s (PEtOx) of different molecular weights by strain-promoted azide-alkyne cyclo-addition. The promising pharmacokinetic profile of the 25 kDa PEtOx bioconjugate in mice echoed an efficacy in IAV-infected ferrets. One intraperitoneal administration of this bioconjugate, but not the marketed IFN-α2a bioconjugate, changed the disease course similar to oseltamivir, given orally twice every study day. PEtOxylated IFN-α2a bioconjugates may expand our therapeutic arsenal against future influenza pandemics, particularly in light of rising first-line antiviral drug resistance to IAV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Glaesserella parasuis induces IL-17 production might through PKC-ERK/MAPK and IκB/NF-κB signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35932516/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infections upregulated IL-17 production both in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virulent &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; strains could induced higher IL-17 production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-17 expression positively correlated with degree of pathological tissue injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infection induced IL-17 production through PKC-ERK/MAPK and IκB/NF-κB pathways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our previous study, the outer membrane protein P2 of &lt;em&gt;Glaesserella parasuis&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt;) induced the production of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in host cells. However, how the &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infection produces IL-17A in the host is unknown. In this study, at 48 hpi in piglets, the proportion of Th17 cells in the peripheral blood significantly increased as determined by flow cytometry, but the overall proportion was low. IL-17 mRNA and protein levels significantly increased in the lungs and spleens of infected piglets. Histopathological examination staining, immunohistochemistry and viability counts, revealed that IL-17 expression might be positively correlated with bacterial content and the degree of pathological injury in lung and spleen tissues. Furthermore, when infected with the &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; Nagasaki strain compared with avirulent strain C5, the primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) significantly produced IL-17 in a time-dose dependent manner. In addition, we demonstrated that PKC, MEK and NF-κB signaling pathways were essential for &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt;-induced IL-17 production because the addition of corresponding inhibitors dramatically reduced IL-17 mRNA production. The phosphorylation levels of PKC, ERK1/2 and IκB in &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt;-infected primary PAMs also increased significantly as the infection dose increased as assessed by western blotting. Thus, these finding imply that IL-17 induced by &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infection is dependent on activation of PKC-ERK/MAPK and IκB/NF-κB signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PSMD12-Mediated M1 Ubiquitination of Influenza A Virus at K102 Regulates Viral Replication</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35861516/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M1 of influenza A virus (IAV) is important for the virus life cycle, especially for the assembly and budding of viruses, which is a multistep process that requires host factors. Identifying novel host proteins that interact with M1 and understanding their functions in IAV replication are of great interest in antiviral drug development. In this study, we identified 19 host proteins in DF1 cells suspected to interact with the M1 protein of an H5N6 virus through immunoprecipitation (IP)/mass spectrometry. Among them, PSMD12, a 26S proteasome regulatory subunit, was shown to interact with influenza M1, acting as a positive host factor in IAV replication in avian and human cells. The data showed that PSMD12 promoted K63-linked ubiquitination of M1 at the K102 site. H5N6 and PR8 with an M1-K102 site mutant displayed a significantly weaker replication ability than the wild-type viruses. Mechanistically, PSMD12 promoted M1-M2 virus-like particle (VLP) release, and an M1-K102 mutation disrupted the formation of supernatant M1-M2 VLPs. An H5N6 M1-K102 site mutation or knockdown PSMD12 disrupted the budding release of the virus in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Further study confirmed that M1-K102 site mutation significantly affected the virulence of H5N6 and PR8 viruses in mice. In conclusion, we report the novel host factor PSMD12 which affects the replication of influenza virus by mediating K63-linked ubiquitination of M1 at K102. These findings provide novel insight into the interactions between IAV and host cells, while suggesting an important target for anti-influenza virus drug research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M1 is proposed to play multiple biologically important roles in the life cycle of IAV, which relies largely on host factors. This study is the first one to identify that PSMD12 interacts with M1, mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of M1 at the K102 site, and thus positively regulates influenza virus proliferation. PSMD12 promoted M1-M2 VLP egress, and an M1-K102 mutation affected the M1-M2 VLP formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of this site to the morphology and budding of influenza viruses by obtaining mutant viruses, and the M1 ubiquitination regulator PSMD12 has a similar function to the M1 K102 mutation in regulating virus release and virus morphology. Additionally, we confirm the reduced virulence of H5N6 and PR8 (H1N1) viruses carrying the M1-K102 site mutation in mice. These findings provide novel insights into IAV interactions with host cells and suggest a valid and highly conserved candidate target for antiviral drug development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COVID-19 lung disease shares driver AT2 cytopathic features with Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35870428/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In the aftermath of Covid-19, some patients develop a fibrotic lung disease, i.e., post-COVID-19 lung disease (PCLD), for which we currently lack insights into pathogenesis, disease models, or treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Using an AI-guided approach, we analyzed &amp;gt; 1000 human lung transcriptomic datasets associated with various lung conditions using two viral pandemic signatures (ViP and sViP) and one covid lung-derived signature. Upon identifying similarities between COVID-19 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), we subsequently dissected the basis for such similarity from molecular, cytopathic, and immunologic perspectives using a panel of IPF-specific gene signatures, alongside signatures of alveolar type II (AT2) cytopathies and of prognostic monocyte-driven processes that are known drivers of IPF. Transcriptome-derived findings were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to identify the major triggers of AT2 dysfunction. Key findings were validated in hamster and human adult lung organoid (ALO) pre-clinical models of COVID-19 using immunohistochemistry and qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Findings:&lt;/em&gt; COVID-19 resembles IPF at a fundamental level; it recapitulates the gene expression patterns (ViP and IPF signatures), cytokine storm (IL15-centric), and the AT2 cytopathic changes, e.g., injury, DNA damage, arrest in a transient, damage-induced progenitor state, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These immunocytopathic features were induced in pre-clinical COVID models (ALO and hamster) and reversed with effective anti-CoV-2 therapeutics in hamsters. PPI-network analyses pinpointed ER stress as one of the shared early triggers of both diseases, and IHC studies validated the same in the lungs of deceased subjects with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamster lungs. Lungs from tg-mice, in which ER stress is induced specifically in the AT2 cells, faithfully recapitulate the host immune response and alveolar cytopathic changes that are induced by SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/em&gt; Like IPF, COVID-19 may be driven by injury-induced ER stress that culminates into progenitor state arrest and SASP in AT2 cells. The ViP signatures in monocytes may be key determinants of prognosis. The insights, signatures, disease models identified here are likely to spur the development of therapies for patients with IPF and other fibrotic interstitial lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acute effects of various respiratory viral infections have been well studied, with extensive characterization of the clinical presentation as well as viral pathogenesis and host responses. However, over the course of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence and prevalence of chronic sequelae after acute viral infections have become increasingly appreciated as a serious health concern. Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, alternatively described as &amp;ldquo;long COVID-19,&amp;rdquo; are characterized by symptoms that persist for longer than 28 days after recovery from acute illness. Although there exists substantial heterogeneity in the nature of the observed sequelae, this phenomenon has also been observed in the context of other respiratory viral infections including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In this Review, we discuss the various sequelae observed following important human respiratory viral pathogens and our current understanding of the immunological mechanisms underlying the failure of restoration of homeostasis in the lung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gammaherpesviruses (γHVs) have coevolved with their host, leading to a remarkably high infection prevalence and establishment of latency. The lifelong persistence of γHVs in hosts appears to broadly shape host immunity, and we show here that pulmonary infection with Murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4), a mouse γHV, drives the recruitment of Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes (MOs) into the airway, thereby modulating the host immune response. The absence of Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; MOs is associated with severe virus-induced immunopathology and the systemic release of inflammatory mediators. Mechanistically, MuHV-4-imprinted MOs recruit CD4 T cells to the airways and trigger immunosuppressive signaling pathways through the PD-L1/PD-1 axis, thereby dampening the deleterious activation of cytotoxic CD4 T cells. These results uncover a role for Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; MOs in modulating CD4 T cell functions and reveal pathways that could be targeted therapeutically to reduce detrimental immunopathological responses associated with respiratory viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human-type sialic acid receptors contribute to avian influenza A virus binding and entry by hetero-multivalent interactions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishment of zoonotic viruses, causing pandemics like the Spanish flu and Covid-19, requires adaptation to human receptors. Pandemic influenza A viruses (IAV) that crossed the avian-human species barrier switched from binding avian-type α2-3-linked sialic acid (2-3Sia) to human-type 2-6Sia receptors. Here, we show that this specificity switch is however less dichotomous as generally assumed. Binding and entry specificity were compared using mixed synthetic glycan gradients of 2-3Sia and 2-6Sia and by employing a genetically remodeled Sia repertoire on the surface of a Sia-free cell line and on a sialoglycoprotein secreted from these cells. Expression of a range of (mixed) 2-3Sia and 2-6Sia densities shows that non-binding human-type receptors efficiently enhanced avian IAV binding and entry provided the presence of a low density of high affinity avian-type receptors, and vice versa. Considering the heterogeneity of sialoglycan receptors encountered in vivo, hetero-multivalent binding is physiologically relevant and will impact evolutionary pathways leading to host adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intermediary Role of Lung Alveolar Type 1 Cells in Epithelial Repair upon Sendai Virus Infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lung epithelium forms the first barrier against respiratory pathogens and noxious chemicals; however, little is known about how more than 90% of this barrier, made of AT1 (alveolar type 1) cells, responds to injury. Using the Sendai virus to model natural infection in mice, we find evidence that AT1 cells have an intermediary role by persisting in areas depleted of AT2 cells, upregulating IFN responsive genes, and receding from invading airway cells. Sendai virus infection mobilizes airway cells to form alveolar SOX2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Sry-box 2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) clusters without differentiating into AT1 or AT2 cells. Large AT2 cell-depleted areas remain covered by AT1 cells, which we name &amp;ldquo;AT2-less regions&amp;rdquo;, and are replaced by SOX2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clusters spreading both basally and luminally. AT2 cell proliferation and differentiation are largely confined to topologically distal regions and form &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; alveolar surface, with limited contribution to &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; repairs of AT2-less regions. Time-course single-cell RNA sequencing profiling and RNAscope validation suggest enhanced immune responses and altered growth signals in AT1 cells. Our comprehensive spatiotemporal and genomewide study highlights the hitherto unappreciated role of AT1 cells in lung injury-repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The generation of stem cell-like memory cells early after BNT162b2 vaccination is associated with durability of memory CD8&#43; T cell responses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spike-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells quantitatively decrease 6 months after BNT162b2 vaccination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; cells are successfully generated by BNT162b2 vaccination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; cell generation significantly correlates with the durability of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; cell generation inversely correlates with the age of vaccinated individuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines elicit humoral and cellular immune responses. Durable maintenance of vaccine-induced immunity is required for long-term protection of the host. Here, we examine activation and differentiation of vaccine-induced CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells using MHC class I (MHC-I) multimers and correlations between early differentiation and the durability of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses among healthcare workers immunized with two doses of BNT162b2. The frequency of MHC-I multimer&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells is robustly increased by BNT162b2 but decreases 6 months post-second vaccination to 2.4%-65.6% (23.0% on average) of the peak. MHC-I multimer&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells dominantly exhibit phenotypes of activated effector cells 1-2 weeks post-second vaccination and gradually acquire phenotypes of long-term memory cells, including stem cell-like memory T (T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt;) cells. Importantly, the frequency of T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; cells 1-2 weeks post-second vaccination significantly correlates with the 6-month durability of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, indicating that early generation of T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; cells determines the longevity of vaccine-induced memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recapitulating influenza virus infection and facilitating antiviral and neuroprotective screening in tractable brain organoids</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35910807/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human pluripotent stem cell derived brain organoids offer an unprecedented opportunity for various applications as &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; model. Currently, human brain organoids as models have been used to understand virus-induced neurotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The brain organoids were separately challenged by multiple viruses including influenza viruses (H1N1-WSN and H3N2-HKT68), Enteroviruses (EV68 and EV71) and Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV) to investigate the impaired effect of these viruses on human brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The brain organoids challenged by influenza viruses had decreased overall organoid size, while enteroviruses infected brain organoids displayed the opposite result. Then, we found WSN preferentially infected MAP2+ neurons compared to SOX2+ neural stem cells (NSCs) and GFAP+ astrocytes in brain organoids, and induced apoptosis of NSCs and neurons, and released inflammatory factors (TNF-α, INF-γ, and IL-6), facilitating brain damage. Furthermore, transcriptional profiling revealed several co-upregulated genes (&lt;em&gt;CSAG3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;OAS2&lt;/em&gt;) and co-downregulated genes (&lt;em&gt;CDC20B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;KCNJ13&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;OTX2-AS1&lt;/em&gt;) after WSN infection for 24 hpi and 96 hpi, implicating target for antiviral drugs development. Finally, we explored compound PYC-12 could significantly suppress virus infection, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, we established a tractable experimental model to investigate the impact and mechanism of virus infection on human brain development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters and humans results in lasting and unique systemic perturbations after recovery</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can result in prolonged pathologies collectively referred to as post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long COVID. To better understand the mechanism underlying long COVID biology, we compared the short- and long-term systemic responses in the golden hamster after either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 exceeded IAV in its capacity to cause permanent injury to the lung and kidney and uniquely affected the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory epithelium (OE). Despite a lack of detectable infectious virus, the OB and OE demonstrated myeloid and T cell activation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and an interferon response that correlated with behavioral changes extending a month after viral clearance. These sustained transcriptional changes could also be corroborated from tissue isolated from individuals who recovered from COVID-19. These data highlight a molecular mechanism for persistent COVID-19 symptomology and provide a small animal model to explore future therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Product Is Involved in the Inflammatory Response of Human Adenovirus-Infected Patients</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35875560/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human adenovirus (HAdV) infection causes excessive inflammation associated with severe tissue injury, such as pneumonia. The molecules involved in the underlying inflammatory mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) is mainly expressed on immune cells and lung tissues, and it is a key factor in the initiation and development of inflammation. RAGE can be cleaved by metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) to release the extracellular segment, which is named soluble RAGE (sRAGE), into the intercellular space, where it can bind to RAGE ligands and block RAGE activation and subsequent inflammation. In our study, we enrolled HAdV-infected patients and their contacts to examine the relationship between sRAGE and inflammation induced by HAdV infection. The results showed that HAdV infection stimulated inflammatory cytokine secretion, increased such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels, and suppressed sRAGE expression. sRAGE levels were significantly different between patients with or without pneumonia. We also found that MMP9 was significantly lower in patients with pneumonia, and it was positively correlated with sRAGE levels over 7 days after disease onset. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is an important immune activation signaling pathway that is regulated by RAGE. We observed the activation of the MAPK pathway in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients. Negative correlations between sRAGE and phosphorylated JNK and p38 were observed. These results suggest that sRAGE is involved in HAdV-induced inflammatory responses, and might be a potential therapeutic target to alleviate the HAdV-induced excessive inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The ZCCHC14/TENT4 complex is required for hepatitis A virus RNA synthesis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35867748/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35867748/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite excellent vaccines, unprecedented outbreaks of hepatitis A have resulted in more than 400 fatal infections in the United States since 2016. Many gaps exist in our current understanding of the responsible pathogen, hepatitis A virus (HAV), for which there are no available antiviral therapies. Here, we show how the RNA genome of this unique, hepatotropic picornavirus interacts with a host cell protein complex required for synthesis of the viral RNA. We demonstrate that targeting this complex with an orally delivered small-molecule therapeutic ablates viral replication and reverses liver inflammation in a mouse model of hepatitis A, providing proof-of-principle for antiviral therapy and showing the potential for chemoprevention of hepatitis A in outbreak settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite excellent vaccines, resurgent outbreaks of hepatitis A have caused thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths within the United States in recent years. There is no effective antiviral therapy for hepatitis A, and many aspects of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) replication cycle remain to be elucidated. Replication requires the zinc finger protein ZCCHC14 and noncanonical TENT4 poly(A) polymerases with which it associates, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that ZCCHC14 and TENT4A/B are required for viral RNA synthesis following translation of the viral genome in infected cells. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) experiments revealed that ZCCHC14 binds a small stem-loop in the HAV 5&amp;rsquo; untranslated RNA possessing a Smaug recognition-like pentaloop to which it recruits TENT4. TENT4 polymerases lengthen and stabilize the 3&amp;rsquo; poly(A) tails of some cellular and viral mRNAs, but the chemical inhibition of TENT4A/B with the dihydroquinolizinone RG7834 had no impact on the length of the HAV 3&amp;rsquo; poly(A) tail, stability of HAV RNA, or cap-independent translation of the viral genome. By contrast, RG7834 inhibited the incorporation of 5-ethynyl uridine into nascent HAV RNA, indicating that TENT4A/B function in viral RNA synthesis. Consistent with potent in vitro antiviral activity against HAV (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 6.11 nM), orally administered RG7834 completely blocked HAV infection in &lt;em&gt;Ifnar1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, and sharply reduced serum alanine aminotransferase activities, hepatocyte apoptosis, and intrahepatic inflammatory cell infiltrates in mice with acute hepatitis A. These results reveal requirements for ZCCHC14-TENT4A/B in hepatovirus RNA synthesis, and suggest that TENT4A/B inhibitors may be useful for preventing or treating hepatitis A in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil and Macrophage Response in Acinetobacter Baumannii Infection and Their Relationship to Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35873147/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) infection has become a threat to global public health. AB is one of the main pathogens causing nosocomial infections, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia. AB easily develops resistance against a variety of antibiotics, which makes the treatment of AB infections difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to study new treatment plans like anti-infection immunity. Both animal models of AB infection and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; cell experiments show that macrophages are activated in the early stage of the immune response and regulate the recruitment of neutrophils, thus playing a role in clearing AB. AB components and the immune responses they induce can lead to injury of the infected organ, mostly in the lungs. Understanding the response of innate immunity to ABs at different stages after infection and the relationship between the response and lung injury can help to develop new immunotherapy methods and prevent lung injury. This article provides a comprehensive review of the response of neutrophils and macrophages to AB infection and their association with lung injury to develop effective therapies for AB infection and prevent lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insights on the cGAS-STING Signaling Pathway During Herpesvirus Infections</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herpesviruses belong to large double-stranded DNA viruses. They are under a wide range of hosts and establish lifelong infection, which creates a burden on human health and animal health. Innate immunity is the host&amp;rsquo;s innate defense ability. Activating the innate immune signaling pathway and producing type I interferon is the host&amp;rsquo;s first line of defense against infectious pathogens. Emerging evidence indicates that the cGAS-STING signaling pathway plays an important role in the innate immunity in response to herpesvirus infections. In parallel, because of the constant selective pressure imposed by host immunity, herpesvirus also evolves to target the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to inhibit or escape the innate immune responses. In the current review, we insight on the classical cGAS-STING signaling pathway. We describe the activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway during herpesvirus infections and strategies of herpesvirus targeting this pathway to evade host antiviral response. Furthermore, we outline the immunotherapy boosting cGAS-STING signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages autonomously determine severe outcome of respiratory viral infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35776802/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various lung insults can result in replacement of resident alveolar macrophages (AM) by bone marrow monocyte-derived (BMo)-AM. However, the dynamics of this process and its long-term consequences for respiratory viral infections remain unclear. Using several mouse models and a marker to unambiguously track fetal monocyte-derived (FeMo)-AM and BMo-AM, we established the kinetics and extent of replenishment and their function to recurrent influenza A virus (IAV) infection. A massive loss of FeMo-AM resulted in rapid replenishment by self-renewal of survivors, followed by the generation of BMo-AM. BMo-AM progressively outcompeted FeMo-AM over several months, and this was due to their increased glycolytic and proliferative capacity. The presence of both naïve and experienced BMo-AM conferred severe pathology to IAV infection, which was associated with a proinflammatory phenotype. Furthermore, upon aging of naïve mice, FeMo-AM were gradually replaced by BMo-AM, which contributed to IAV disease severity in a cell-autonomous manner. Together, our results suggest that the origin rather than training of AM determines long-term function to respiratory viral infection and provide an explanation for the increased severity of infection seen in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 0111 Protects Against Influenza Virus by Modulating Intestinal Microbial-Mediated Immune Responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35847111/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations of traditional influenza vaccines concerning novel mutant strains. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop preventive means for antigen-unrelated types of influenza viruses. Recent studies have shown that probiotics can modulate the immune system and reduce the severity of viral infections. In this study, we investigated the potential of &lt;em&gt;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 against influenza virus H9N2. Challenge experiments showed that &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 pretreatments could effectively improve mice&amp;rsquo;s survival rate and weight loss and reduce the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) along with the degree of lung and intestinal injury. FMT experiment demonstrates that the protective effect produced by &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 is associated with gut microorganisms. In addition, 16S high-throughput sequencing of the mouse intestinal microbiota showed that &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 remodeled the intestinal microbiota after H9N2 infection and maintained the gut microbiota balance. In a mouse model, the oral administration of &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 increased IFN-β expression in the serum and BALF. At the same time, the transcript levels of IFN-β and related ISGs in the intestine and lungs of mice were also increased. In addition, the activation and polarization of T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and the spleen were detected by flow cytometry, and the results showed that &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 modulated cytokines in T cells and increased IgA expression in B cells in the MLNs and spleen. Thus, &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 may improve gut microbiota-mediated immune responses and thus, resist infection by the influenza virus, and it could be used as an effective preventive measure against the influenza virus.

      <title>The encephalomyocarditis virus Leader promotes the release of virions inside extracellular vesicles via the induction of secretory autophagy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naked viruses can escape host cells before the induction of lysis via release in extracellular vesicles (EVs). These nanosized EVs cloak the secreted virus particles in a host-derived membrane, which alters virus-host interactions that affect infection efficiency and antiviral immunity. Currently, little is known about the viral and host factors regulating this form of virus release. Here, we assessed the role of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) Leader protein, a &amp;lsquo;viral security protein&amp;rsquo; that subverts the host antiviral response. EV release upon infection with wildtype virus or a Leader-deficient mutant was characterized at the single particle level using high-resolution flow cytometry. Inactivation of the Leader abolished EV induction during infection and strongly reduced EV-enclosed virus release. We demonstrate that the Leader promotes the release of virions within EVs by stimulating a secretory arm of autophagy. This newly discovered role of the EMCV Leader adds to the variety of mechanisms via which this protein affects virus-host interactions. Moreover, these data provide first evidence for a crucial role of a non-structural viral protein in the non-lytic release of picornaviruses via packaging in EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UFL1 promotes antiviral immune response by maintaining STING stability independent of UFMylation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise regulation of STING homeostasis is essential for its antiviral function. Post-translational modification, especially ubiquitination, is important for the regulation of STING homeostasis. Previous studies have focused on how STING is degraded, but little is known about its maintenance. Here, we show that UFM1 specific ligase UFL1 promotes innate immune response by maintaining STING expression independent of UFMylation. Mechanistically, UFL1 inhibits TRIM29 to interact with STING, thereby reducing its ubiquitination at K338/K347/K370 and subsequent proteasomal degradation. DNA virus infection reduces the UFL1 expression, which may promote STING degradation and facilitate viral expansion. Our study identifies UFL1 as a crucial regulator for the maintenance of STING stability and antiviral function, and provides novel insights into the mechanistic explanation for the immunological escape of DNA virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment of methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; infections is dependent on the efficacy of last-line antibiotics including vancomycin. Treatment failure is commonly linked to isolates with intermediate vancomycin resistance (termed VISA). These isolates have accumulated point mutations that collectively reduce vancomycin sensitivity, often by thickening the cell wall. Changes in regulatory small RNA expression have been correlated with antibiotic stress in VISA isolates however the functions of most RNA regulators is unknown. Here we capture RNA-RNA interactions associated with RNase III using CLASH. RNase III-CLASH uncovers hundreds of novel RNA-RNA interactions in vivo allowing functional characterisation of many sRNAs for the first time. Surprisingly, many mRNA-mRNA interactions are recovered and we find that an mRNA encoding a long 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated region (UTR) (termed vigR 3&amp;rsquo;UTR) functions as a regulatory &amp;lsquo;hub&amp;rsquo; within the RNA-RNA interaction network. We demonstrate that the vigR 3&amp;rsquo;UTR promotes expression of folD and the cell wall lytic transglycosylase isaA through direct mRNA-mRNA base-pairing. Deletion of the vigR 3&amp;rsquo;UTR re-sensitised VISA to glycopeptide treatment and both isaA and vigR 3&amp;rsquo;UTR deletions impact cell wall thickness. Our results demonstrate the utility of RNase III-CLASH and indicate that &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; uses mRNA-mRNA interactions to co-ordinate gene expression more widely than previously appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial cyclophilin D promotes disease tolerance by licensing NK cell development and IL-22 production against influenza virus</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitochondrial CypD is required to protect against severe influenza infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CypD expression promotes NK cell lymphopoiesis and maturation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NK cell-derived IL-22 enhances disease tolerance during influenza infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer of WT NK cells confers protection in &lt;em&gt;CypD&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice to influenza infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severity of pulmonary viral infections, including influenza A virus (IAV), is linked to excessive immunopathology, which impairs lung function. Thus, the same immune responses that limit viral replication can concomitantly cause lung damage that must be countered by largely uncharacterized disease tolerance mechanisms. Here, we show that mitochondrial cyclophilin D (CypD) protects against IAV via disease tolerance. &lt;em&gt;CypD&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice are significantly more susceptible to IAV infection despite comparable antiviral immunity. This susceptibility results from damage to the lung epithelial barrier caused by a reduction in interleukin-22 (IL-22)-producing natural killer (NK) cells. Transcriptomic and functional data reveal that &lt;em&gt;CypD&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; NK cells are immature and have altered cellular metabolism and impaired IL-22 production, correlating with dysregulated bone marrow lymphopoiesis. Administration of recombinant IL-22 or transfer of wild-type (WT) NK cells abrogates pulmonary damage and protects &lt;em&gt;CypD&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice after IAV infection. Collectively, these results demonstrate a key role for CypD in NK cell-mediated disease tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tankyrases inhibit innate antiviral response by PARylating VISA/MAVS and priming it for RNF146-mediated ubiquitination and degradation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35733260/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During viral infection, sensing of viral RNA by retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors (RLRs) initiates an antiviral innate immune response, which is mediated by the mitochondrial adaptor protein VISA (virus-induced signal adaptor; also known as mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein [MAVS]). VISA is regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as polyubiquitination, phosphorylation, O-linked β-d-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation), and monomethylation. However, whether other forms of PTMs regulate VISA-mediated innate immune signaling remains elusive. Here, we report that Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is a PTM of VISA, which attenuates innate immune response to RNA viruses. Using a biochemical purification approach, we identified tankyrase 1 (TNKS1) as a VISA-associated protein. Viral infection led to the induction of TNKS1 and its homolog TNKS2, which translocated from cytosol to mitochondria and interacted with VISA. TNKS1 and TNKS2 catalyze the PARylation of VISA at Glu137 residue, thereby priming it for K48-linked polyubiquitination by the E3 ligase Ring figure protein 146 (RNF146) and subsequent degradation. Consistently, TNKS1, TNKS2, or RNF146 deficiency increased the RNA virus-triggered induction of downstream effector genes and impaired the replication of the virus. Moreover, TNKS1- or TNKS2-deficient mice produced higher levels of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines after virus infection and markedly reduced virus loads in the brains and lungs. Together, our findings uncover an essential role of PARylation of VISA in virus-triggered innate immune signaling, which represents a mechanism to avoid excessive harmful immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SATB1 ensures appropriate transcriptional programs within naïve CD8&#43; T cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35713361/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special AT-binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a chromatin-binding protein that has been shown to be a key regulator of T-cell development and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell fate decisions and function. The underlying function for SATB1 in peripheral CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell differentiation processes is largely unknown. To address this, we examined SATB1-binding patterns in naïve and effector CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells demonstrating that SATB1 binds to noncoding regulatory elements linked to T-cell lineage-specific gene programs, particularly in naïve CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. We then assessed SATB1 function using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutant mice that exhibit a point mutation in the SATB1 DNA-binding domain (termed Satb1m1Anu/m1Anu ). Satb1m1Anu/m1Anu mice exhibit diminished SATB1-binding, naïve, Satb1m1Anu/m1Anu CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells exhibiting transcriptional and phenotypic characteristics reminiscent of effector T cells. Upon activation, the transcriptional signatures of Satb1m1Anu/m1Anu and wild-type effector CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells converged. While there were no overt differences, primary respiratory infection of Satb1m1Anu/m1Anu mice with influenza A virus (IAV) resulted in a decreased proportion and number of IAV-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; effector T cells recruited to the infected lung when compared with wild-type mice. Together, these data suggest that SATB1 has a major role in an appropriate transcriptional state within naïve CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and ensures appropriate CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell effector gene expression upon activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The autophagy-related degradation of MDA5 by Tembusu virus nonstructural 2B disrupts IFNβ production</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35713934/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duck Tembusu virus (TMUV) is a serious avian pathogen causing a decline in egg production, but the mechanism of the virus that breaks through the innate immune system is poorly understood. Here, we show that TMUV inhibits poly(I:C)-induced interferon (IFN) production. Because poly(I:C) transfection can specifically activate the MDA5 pathway in duck primary cells, we found that infection with TMUV can specifically target MDA5 and lead to its degradation. MDA5 downregulation could be blocked by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) but not a proteasome inhibitor, strongly implicating MDA5 degradation as an autophagy-related degradation pathway. Pretreatment with 3-MA enhanced the expression of MDA5 and inhibited TMUV replication. To screen TMUV proteins that degraded MDA5, the TMUV replicon and MDA5-Flag were cotransfected into cells, and the western blot analysis showed that nonstructural 2B (NS2B) can degrade MDA5 in a dose-dependent manner. Dual-luciferase assays indicate that NS2B alone inhibits MDA5- or poly(I:C)-mediated IFN production. NS2B binds MDA5 in the presence of 3-MA. The deletion of the amino acids of NS2B from residues 51 to 92 (hydrophilic area) restored the expression of MDA5 and relieved the MDA5-mediated IFNβ production inhibition by NS2B, indicating that the hydrophilic area of NS2B is important for its interaction with host innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;TH inhibit infection of influenza A virus in murine macrophages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TH activates the type-1 interferon related pathway including TBK-STAT signaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TH increases expression of IFN-stimulating genes (ISG’s) and IFN-inducible transmembrane 3 (IFITM3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TH could be a potential preventive and therapeutic agents for influenza A virus by modulating the regulates innate immune response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, attention has focused on the prevention and treatment of respiratory viruses including influenza viruses. We evaluated the antiviral effect of &lt;em&gt;Tilia amurensis&lt;/em&gt; honey (TH) against influenza A virus in murine macrophages. Influenza A virus infection was reduced following pretreatment with TH. Pretreatment of murine macrophages with TH increased the production and secretion of type-1 interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines and increased phosphorylation of the type-1 IFN-related proteins, TANK-binding kinase (TBK), and STAT. Moreover, TH increased the expression of IFN-stimulating genes and increased the expression of IFN-inducible transmembrane (IFITM3), a protein that interferes with virus replication and entry. Taken together, these findings suggest that TH suppresses influenza A virus infection by regulating the innate immune response in macrophages. This supports the development of preventive and therapeutic agents for influenza A virus and enhances the economic value of TH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NS1 protein of Influenza A virus (IAV) promotes lncNSPL expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deficiency of lncNSPL specifically enhances retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) initiated IFN production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lncNSPL competes with tripartite interaction motif 25 (TRIM25) for binding RIG-I and inhibits its K63 ubiquitination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lncNSPL inhibits innate antiviral immune responses and enhances viral replication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in host antiviral responses; however, how viruses exploit host lncRNAs for immune evasion remains largely unexplored. Functional screening of differentially expressed lncRNA profile in patients infected with influenza A virus (IAV) revealed that lncNSPL (Gene Symbol: LOC105370355) was highly expressed in monocytes. Deregulated lncNSPL expression in infected monocytes significantly increased type I interferon (IFN-I) production and inhibited IAV replication. Moreover, lncNSPL overexpression in mice increased the susceptibility to IAV infection and impaired IFN-I production. LncNSPL directly bound to retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and blocked the interaction between RIG-I and E3 ligase tripartite interaction motif 25 (TRIM25), reducing TRIM25-mediated lysine 63 (K63)-linked RIG-I ubiquitination and limiting the downstream production of antiviral mediators during the late stage of IAV infection. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the means by which lncNSPL promotes IAV replication and immune escape via restricting the TRIM25-mediated RIG-I K63-linked ubiquitination. Thus, lncNSPL may represent a promising pharmaceutical target for anti-IAV therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; All patients with PCR-verified COVID-19 and gave consent, and who were admitted to a tertiary Intensive care unit (ICU) in Sweden during March-September 2020 were included. Demography, repeated blood samples and measures of organ function were collected. Analyses of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM, IgA and IgG) in plasma were performed and correlated to patient outcome and biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 115 patients (median age 62 years, 77% male) were included prospectively. All patients developed severe respiratory dysfunction, and 59% were treated with invasive ventilation. Thirty-day mortality was 22.6% for all included patients. Patients negative for any anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in plasma during ICU admission had higher 30-day mortality compared to patients positive for antibodies. Patients positive for IgM had more ICU-, ventilator-, renal replacement therapy- and vasoactive medication-free days. IgA antibody concentrations correlated negatively with both SAPS3 and maximal SOFA-score and IgM-levels correlated negatively with SAPS3. Patients with antibody levels below the detection limit had higher plasma levels of extracellular histones on day 1 and elevated levels of kidney and cardiac biomarkers, but showed no signs of increased inflammation, complement activation or cytokine release. After adjusting for age, positive IgM and IgG antibodies were still associated with increased 30-day survival, with odds ratio (OR) 7.1 (1.5-34.4) and 4.2 (1.1-15.7), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In patients with severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care, a poor antibody response is associated with organ failure, systemic histone release and increased 30-day mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of histone acetyltransferase GCN5 by a transcription factor FgPacC controls fungal adaption to host-derived iron stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35687128/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poaceae plants can locally accumulate iron to suppress pathogen infection. It remains unknown how pathogens overcome host-derived iron stress during their successful infections. Here, we report that Fusarium graminearum (Fg), a destructive fungal pathogen of cereal crops, is challenged by host-derived high-iron stress. Fg infection induces host alkalinization, and the pH-dependent transcription factor FgPacC undergoes a proteolytic cleavage into the functional isoform named FgPacC30 under alkaline host environment. Subsequently FgPacC30 binds to a GCCAR(R = A/G)G element at the promoters of the genes involved in iron uptake and inhibits their expression, leading to adaption of Fg to high-iron stress. Mechanistically, FgPacC30 binds to FgGcn5 protein, a catalytic subunit of Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, leading to deregulation of histone acetylation at H3K18 and H2BK11, and repression of iron uptake genes. Moreover, we identified a protein kinase FgHal4, which is highly induced by extracellular high-iron stress and protects FgPacC30 against 26S proteasome-dependent degradation by promoting FgPacC30 phosphorylation at Ser2. Collectively, this study uncovers a novel inhibitory mechanism of the SAGA complex by a transcription factor that enables a fungal pathogen to adapt to dynamic microenvironments during infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mosquito saliva enhances virus infection through sialokinin-dependent vascular leakage</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35675424/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increasingly important group of infectious agents is viruses spread by mosquitoes. When infected mosquitoes bite people, they inject virus and saliva into the skin. The saliva is biologically active and helps the mosquito feed but also helps the virus to infect and replicate. Sialokinin is a peptide in mosquito saliva that is unique within the insect world as having vertebrate-like tachykinin function, which can be proinflammatory. We show that sialokinin increases blood vessel permeability, allowing an influx of virus-permissive cells. Increasing the frequency of these cells in skin provides more opportunities for the virus to replicate. Inhibiting mosquito salivary factors holds promise as a panviral strategy for reducing disease burden caused by a wide variety of mosquito-borne viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses transmitted by &lt;em&gt;Aedes&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes are an increasingly important global cause of disease. Defining common determinants of host susceptibility to this large group of heterogenous pathogens is key for informing the rational design of panviral medicines. Infection of the vertebrate host with these viruses is enhanced by mosquito saliva, a complex mixture of salivary-gland-derived factors and microbiota. We show that the enhancement of infection by saliva was dependent on vascular function and was independent of most antisaliva immune responses, including salivary microbiota. Instead, the &lt;em&gt;Aedes&lt;/em&gt; gene product sialokinin mediated the enhancement of virus infection through a rapid reduction in endothelial barrier integrity. Sialokinin is unique within the insect world as having a vertebrate-like tachykinin sequence and is absent from &lt;em&gt;Anopheles mosquitoes&lt;/em&gt;, which are incompetent for most arthropod-borne viruses, whose saliva was not proviral and did not induce similar vascular permeability. Therapeutic strategies targeting sialokinin have the potential to limit disease severity following infection with &lt;em&gt;Aedes&lt;/em&gt;-mosquito-borne viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electronic cigarette vapor exposure exaggerates the pro-inflammatory response during influenza A viral infection in human distal airway epithelium</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35672461/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic cigarettes or vaping products have been marketed as a safer alternative to smoking, but very little is known about the health effects in the human lung, particularly in the distal airways, a key site of airway obstruction and destruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is often exacerbated by viral infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of electronic cigarette vapor (e-vapor) on human distal airway epithelial responses to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We isolated primary small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) from donor lungs free of lung disease, and cultured them at air-liquid interface (ALI). To measure markers of epithelial injury such as integrity of epithelial barrier structure and function, we selected a regimen of non-toxic, barrier preserving e-vapor exposure of cultured cells to 15 puffs of e-vapor from a commercially available e-cigarette once per day for 3 days, prior to IAV infection. After 72 h of infection, media and cell lysates were collected to measure cytokines involved in inflammatory and antiviral responses. Pre-exposure to e-vapor with IAV infection, compared to IAV infection alone, significantly increased inflammatory and antiviral mediators including IL-8, CXCL10, IFN-beta, and MX1. Our results suggest that e-vapor exposure amplifies human distal airway pro-inflammatory response to IAV infection, independently of the severity of cell injury during viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neoadjuvant Intravenous Oncolytic Vaccinia Virus Therapy Promotes Anticancer Immunity in Patients</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving the chances of curing patients with cancer who have had surgery to remove metastatic sites of disease is a priority area for cancer research. &lt;em&gt;Pexa-Vec&lt;/em&gt; (Pexastimogene Devacirepvec; JX-594, TG6006) is a principally immunotherapeutic oncolytic virus that has reached late-phase clinical trials. We report the results of a single-center, nonrandomized biological end point study (trial registration: EudraCT number 2012-000704-15), which builds on the success of the presurgical intravenous delivery of oncolytic viruses to tumors. Nine patients with either colorectal cancer liver metastases or metastatic melanoma were treated with a single intravenous infusion of &lt;em&gt;Pexa-Vec&lt;/em&gt; ahead of planned surgical resection of the metastases. Grade 3 and 4 &lt;em&gt;Pexa-Vec&lt;/em&gt;-associated side effects were lymphopaenia and neutropaenia. &lt;em&gt;Pexa-Vec&lt;/em&gt; was peripherally carried in plasma and was not associated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Upon surgical resection, &lt;em&gt;Pexa-Vec&lt;/em&gt; was found in the majority of analyzed tumors. &lt;em&gt;Pexa-Vec&lt;/em&gt; therapy associated with IFNα secretion, chemokine induction, and resulted in transient innate and long-lived adaptive anticancer immunity. In the 2 patients with significant and complete tumor necrosis, a reduction in the peripheral T-cell receptor diversity was observed at the time of surgery. These results support the development of presurgical oncolytic vaccinia virus-based therapies to stimulate anticancer immunity and increase the chances to cure patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long-term hepatitis B virus infection of rhesus macaques requires suppression of host immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35637225/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B virus has infected a third of the world&amp;rsquo;s population, and 296 million people are living with chronic infection. Chronic infection leads to progressive liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure, and there remains no reliable curative therapy. These gaps in our understanding are due, in large part, to a paucity of animal models of HBV infection. Here, we show that rhesus macaques regularly clear acute HBV infection, similar to adult humans, but can develop long-term infection if immunosuppressed. Similar to patients, we longitudinally detected HBV DNA, HBV surface antigen, and HBV e antigen in the serum of experimentally infected animals. In addition, we discovered hallmarks of HBV infection in the liver, including RNA transcription, HBV core and HBV surface antigen translation, and covalently closed circular DNA biogenesis. This pre-clinical animal model will serve to accelerate emerging HBV curative therapies into the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nuclear antiviral innate responses at the intersection of DNA sensing and DNA repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35641341/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coevolution of vertebrate and mammalian hosts with DNA viruses has driven the ability of host cells to distinguish viral from cellular DNA in the nucleus to induce intrinsic immune responses. Concomitant viral mechanisms have arisen to inhibit DNA sensing. At this virus-host interface, emerging evidence links cytokine responses and cellular homeostasis pathways, particularly the DNA damage response (DDR). Nuclear DNA sensors, such as the interferon (IFN)-γ inducible protein 16 (IFI16), functionally intersect with the DDR regulators ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Here, we discuss accumulating knowledge for the DDR-innate immunity signaling axis. Through the lens of this infection-driven signaling axis, we present host and viral molecular strategies acquired to regulate autoinflammation and antiviral responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The C-terminal LCAR of host ANP32 proteins interacts with the influenza A virus nucleoprotein to promote the replication of the viral RNA genome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35639917/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The segmented negative-sense RNA genome of influenza A virus is assembled into ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP) with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nucleoprotein (NP). It is in the context of these RNPs that the polymerase transcribes and replicates viral RNA (vRNA). Host acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32) family proteins play an essential role in vRNA replication by mediating the dimerization of the viral polymerase via their N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. However, whether the C-terminal low-complexity acidic region (LCAR) plays a role in RNA synthesis remains unknown. Here, we report that the LCAR is required for viral genome replication during infection. Specifically, we show that the LCAR directly interacts with NP and this interaction is mutually exclusive with RNA. Furthermore, we show that the replication of a short vRNA-like template that can be replicated in the absence of NP is less sensitive to LCAR truncations compared with the replication of full-length vRNA segments which is NP-dependent. We propose a model in which the LCAR interacts with NP to promote NP recruitment to nascent RNA during influenza virus replication, ensuring the co-replicative assembly of RNA into RNPs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular mitochondria drive CD8 T cell dysfunction in trauma by upregulating CD39</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35613855/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35613855/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; The increased mortality and morbidity seen in critically injured patients appears associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and immune dysfunction, which ultimately predisposes to infection. Mitochondria released by injury could generate danger molecules, for example, ATP, which in turn would be rapidly scavenged by ectonucleotidases, expressed on regulatory immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To determine the association between circulating mitochondria, purinergic signalling and immune dysfunction after trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We tested the impact of hepatocyte-derived free mitochondria on blood-derived and lung-derived CD8 T cells in vitro and in experimental mouse models in vivo. In parallel, immune phenotypic analyses were conducted on blood-derived CD8 T cells obtained from trauma patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Isolated intact mitochondria are functional and generate ATP ex vivo. Extracellular mitochondria perturb CD8+ T cells in co-culture, inducing select features of immune exhaustion in vitro. These effects are modulated by scavenging ATP, modelled by addition of apyrase in vitro. Injection of intact mitochondria into recipient mice markedly upregulates the ectonucleotidase CD39, and other immune checkpoint markers in circulating CD8+ T cells. We note that mice injected with mitochondria, prior to instilling bacteria into the lung, exhibit more severe lung injury, characterised by elevated neutrophil influx and by changes in CD8+ T cell cytotoxic capacity. Importantly, the development of SIRS in injured humans, is likewise associated with disordered purinergic signalling and CD8 T cell dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These studies in experimental models and in a cohort of trauma patients reveal important associations between extracellular mitochondria, aberrant purinergic signalling and immune dysfunction. These pathogenic factors with immune exhaustion are linked to SIRS and could be targeted therapeutically.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HCMV-miR-US33-5p promotes apoptosis of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells by targeting EPAS1/SLC3A2 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35596131/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35596131/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD), increased vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis has been found. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-miR-US33-5p was significantly increased in the plasma of patients with AAD. However, the roles of miR-US33-5p in human aortic VSMC (HA-VSMC) apoptosis remain to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In the current study, cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry, cell proliferation by CCK-8 assay, and differentially expressed genes by RNA sequencing. Luciferase reporter assay was used for binding analysis between miR-US33-5p and endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1), and EPAS1 and amino acid transporter heavy chain, member 2 (SLC3A2). The enrichment degree of SLC3A2 promoter DNA was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting were performed for measuring messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; It was found that HCMV infection inhibited proliferation but promoted HA-VSMC apoptosis by upregulating HCMV-miR-US33-5p. Transfection of HCMV-miR-US33-5p mimics the significant effect on several signaling pathways including integrin signaling as shown in the RNA sequencing data. Western blotting analysis confirmed that HCMV-miR-US33-5p mimics suppression of the activity of key factors of the integrin signal pathway including FAK, AKT, CAS, and Rac. Mechanistic study showed that HCMV-miR-US33-5p bound to the 3&amp;rsquo;-untranslated region of EPAS1 to suppress its expression, leading to suppression of SLC3A2 expression, which ultimately promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation. This was confirmed by the findings that silencing EPAS1 significantly reduced the SLC3A2 expression and inhibited proliferation and key factors of integrin signal pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; HCMV-miR-US33-5p suppressed proliferation, key factors of integrin signal pathway, and EPAS1/SLC3A2 expression, but promoted HA-VSMC apoptosis. These findings highlighted the importance of HCMV-miR-US33-5p/EPAS1/SCL3A2 signaling and may provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for AAD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the discovery of fundamental roles for the noncanonical inflammasome molecule Caspase-4/11 in promoting pathological inflammatory and prothrombotic pathways in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV-2) infections. Our work demonstrates that Caspase-11 has a broader role in immune responses beyond its previously appreciated effects in bacterial infections. Further, we show that Caspase-11–deficient mice infected with SARS–CoV-2 fare significantly better in terms of overall illness, lung inflammation, and thrombosis than wild-type (WT) mice, thus implicating Caspase-11 as a new therapeutic target for preventing or treating COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV-2) is a worldwide health concern, and new treatment strategies are needed. Targeting inflammatory innate immunity pathways holds therapeutic promise, but effective molecular targets remain elusive. Here, we show that human caspase-4 (CASP4) and its mouse homolog, caspase-11 (CASP11), are up-regulated in SARS–CoV-2 infections and that CASP4 expression correlates with severity of SARS–CoV-2 infection in humans. SARS–CoV-2–infected &lt;em&gt;Casp11&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice were protected from severe weight loss and lung pathology, including blood vessel damage, compared to wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking the caspase downstream effector gasdermin-D (&lt;em&gt;Gsdmd&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). Notably, viral titers were similar regardless of CASP11 knockout. Global transcriptomics of SARS–CoV-2–infected WT, &lt;em&gt;Casp11&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gsdmd&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lungs identified restrained expression of inflammatory molecules and altered neutrophil gene signatures in &lt;em&gt;Casp11&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. We confirmed that protein levels of inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and CXCL1, as well as neutrophil functions, were reduced in &lt;em&gt;Casp11&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lungs. Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Casp11&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lungs accumulated less von Willebrand factor, a marker for endothelial damage, but expressed more Kruppel-Like Factor 2, a transcription factor that maintains vascular integrity. Overall, our results demonstrate that CASP4/11 promotes detrimental SARS–CoV-2–induced inflammation and coagulopathy, largely independently of GSDMD, identifying CASP4/11 as a promising drug target for treatment and prevention of severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ZBP1-dependent inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, and cytokine storm disrupt IFN therapeutic efficacy during coronavirus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35587515/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZBP1 fans the flames of cytokine storm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferons (IFNs) provide robust innate immune protection against β-coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 when available soon after infection. Paradoxically, therapeutic use of type I IFNs in patients with severe COVID-19 may promote increased pathology and clinical deterioration. Using a mouse model of respiratory β-coronavirus infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Karki et al. found that the detrimental effects of type I IFNs in later stages of infection were related to IFN-induced expression of ZBP1, an innate immune sensor also capable of inducing PANoptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death. Mice lacking ZBP1 were protected from IFN-induced lethality in the MHV infection model. These findings suggest that ZBP1 could be targeted therapeutically in severe COVID-19 to ward off deleterious effects of type I IFNs including cytokine storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), continues to cause substantial morbidity and mortality in the ongoing global pandemic. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms that govern innate immune and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Whereas interferon (IFN)-based therapies are generally expected to be beneficial during viral infection, clinical trials in COVID-19 have shown limited efficacy and potential detrimental effects of IFN treatment during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this failure remain unknown. In this study, we found that IFN induced Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1)-mediated inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in human and murine macrophages and in the lungs of mice infected with β-coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). In patients with COVID-19, expression of the innate immune sensor &lt;em&gt;ZBP1&lt;/em&gt; was increased in immune cells from those who succumbed to the disease compared with those who recovered, further suggesting a link between ZBP1 and pathology. In mice, IFN-β treatment after β-coronavirus infection increased lethality, and genetic deletion of &lt;em&gt;Zbp1&lt;/em&gt; or its Zα domain suppressed cell death and protected the mice from IFN-mediated lethality during β-coronavirus infection. Overall, our results identify that ZBP1 induced during coronavirus infection limits the efficacy of IFN therapy by driving inflammatory cell death and lethality. Therefore, inhibiting ZBP1 activity may improve the efficacy of IFN therapy, paving the way for the development of new and critically needed therapeutics for COVID-19 as well as other infections and inflammatory conditions where IFN-mediated cell death and pathology occur.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Combinational benefit of antihistamines and remdesivir for reducing SARS-CoV-2 replication and alleviating inflammation-induced lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35503561/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the combination of anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapy is predicted to provide clinical benefits. We recently demonstrated that mast cells (MCs) are an essential mediator of SARS-CoV-2-initiated hyperinflammation. We also showed that spike protein-induced MC degranulation initiates alveolar epithelial inflammation for barrier disruption and suggested an off-label use of antihistamines as MC stabilizers to block degranulation and consequently suppress inflammation and prevent lung injury. In this study, we emphasized the essential role of MCs in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung lesions in vivo, and demonstrated the benefits of co-administration of antihistamines and antiviral drug remdesivir in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-induced MC degranulation resulted in alveolar-capillary injury, while pretreatment of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells with antihistamines prevented adhesion junction disruption; predictably, the combination of antiviral drug remdesivir with the antihistamine loratadine, a histamine receptor 1 (HR1) antagonist, dampened viral replication and inflammation, thereby greatly reducing lung injury. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of MCs in SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and lung injury and provide a feasible combination antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapy for COVID-19 treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DEAD/H-Box Helicases in Immunity, Inflammation, Cell Differentiation, and Cell Death and Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35626643/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEAD/H-box proteins are the largest family of RNA helicases in mammalian genomes, and they are present in all kingdoms of life. Since their discovery in the late 1980s, DEAD/H-box family proteins have been a major focus of study. They have been found to play central roles in RNA metabolism, gene expression, signal transduction, programmed cell death, and the immune response to bacterial and viral infections. Aberrant functions of DEAD/H-box proteins have been implicated in a wide range of human diseases that include cancer, neurodegeneration, and inherited genetic disorders. In this review, we provide a historical context and discuss the molecular functions of DEAD/H-box proteins, highlighting the recent discoveries linking their dysregulation to human diseases. We will also discuss the state of knowledge regarding two specific DEAD/H-box proteins that have critical roles in immune responses and programmed cell death, DDX3X and DDX58, also known as RIG-I. Given their importance in homeostasis and disease, an improved understanding of DEAD/H-box protein biology and protein-protein interactions will be critical for informing strategies to counteract the pathogenesis associated with several human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SEC is an antiangiogenic virulence factor that promotes Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis independent of superantigen activity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35544579/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin C (SEC) is critical for &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; infective endocarditis (SAIE) in rabbits. Superantigenicity, its hallmark function, was proposed to be a major underlying mechanism driving SAIE but was not directly tested. With the use of S. aureus MW2 expressing SEC toxoids, we show that superantigenicity does not sufficiently account for vegetation growth, myocardial inflammation, and acute kidney injury in the rabbit model of native valve SAIE. These results highlight the critical contribution of an alternative function of superantigens to SAIE. In support of this, we provide evidence that SEC exerts antiangiogenic effects by inhibiting branching microvessel formation in an ex vivo rabbit aortic ring model and by inhibiting endothelial cell expression of one of the most potent mediators of angiogenesis, VEGF-A. SEC&amp;rsquo;s ability to interfere with tissue revascularization and remodeling after injury serves as a mechanism to promote SAIE and its life-threatening systemic pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cumulative SARS-CoV-2 mutations and corresponding changes in immunity in an immunocompromised patient indicate viral evolution within the host</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35538074/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different scenarios explaining the emergence of novel variants of concern (VOC) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported, including their evolution in scarcely monitored populations, in animals as alternative hosts, or in immunocompromised individuals. Here we report SARS-CoV-2 immune escape mutations over a period of seven months in an immunocompromised patient with prolonged viral shedding. Signs of infection, viral shedding and mutation events are periodically analyzed using RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing based on naso-pharyngeal swabs, with the results complemented by immunological diagnostics to determine humoral and T cell immune responses. Throughout the infection course, 17 non-synonymous intra-host mutations are noted, with 15 (88.2%) having been previously described as prominent immune escape mutations (S:E484K, S:D950N, S:P681H, S:N501Y, S:del(9), N:S235F and S:H655Y) in VOCs. The high frequency of these non-synonymous mutations is consistent with multiple events of convergent evolution. Thus, our results suggest that specific mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may represent positions with a fitness advantage, and may serve as targets in future vaccine and therapeutics development for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KSHV episome tethering sites on host chromosomes and regulation of latency-lytic switch by CHD4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KSHV episomes tether to host chromosomes at CHD4 enriched regions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHD4-LANA complex binds to the PAN RNA promoter and terminal repeat regions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The viral long non-coding RNA sequesters CHD4 from KSHV genomes during reactivation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHD4 facilitates KSHV to establish latency and inhibits reactivation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) establishes a latent infection in the cell nucleus, but where KSHV episomal genomes are tethered and the mechanisms underlying KSHV lytic reactivation are unclear. Here, we study the nuclear microenvironment of KSHV episomes and show that the KSHV latency-lytic replication switch is regulated via viral long non-coding (lnc)RNA-CHD4 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4) interaction. KSHV episomes localize with CHD4 and ADNP proteins, components of the cellular ChAHP complex. The CHD4 and ADNP proteins occupy the 5&amp;rsquo;-region of the highly inducible lncRNAs and terminal repeats of the KSHV genome together with latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA). Viral lncRNA binding competes with CHD4 DNA binding, and KSHV reactivation sequesters CHD4 from the KSHV genome, which is also accompanied by detachment of KSHV episomes from host chromosome docking sites. We propose a model in which robust KSHV lncRNA expression determines the latency-lytic decision by regulating LANA/CHD4 binding to KSHV episomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The gut microbiota prime systemic antiviral immunity via the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35545033/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppression of gut microbiota renders mice susceptible to systemic viral infections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gut microbiota drive systemic antiviral immunity via IFN-I priming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbiota-driven IFN-I priming involves the cGAS-STING axis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbiota mediate systemic IFN-I priming via DNA-containing membrane vesicles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbiota are vital for immune homeostasis and provide a competitive barrier to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Here, we investigated how gut commensals modulate systemic immunity and response to viral infection. Antibiotic suppression of the gut microbiota reduced systemic tonic type I interferon (IFN-I) and antiviral priming. The microbiota-driven tonic IFN-I-response was dependent on cGAS-STING but not on TLR signaling or direct host-bacteria interactions. Instead, membrane vesicles (MVs) from extracellular bacteria activated the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis by delivering bacterial DNA into distal host cells. DNA-containing MVs from the gut microbiota were found in circulation and promoted the clearance of both DNA (herpes simplex virus type 1) and RNA (vesicular stomatitis virus) viruses in a cGAS-dependent manner. In summary, this study establishes an important role for the microbiota in peripheral cGAS-STING activation, which promotes host resistance to systemic viral infections. Moreover, it uncovers an underappreciated risk of antibiotic use during viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VMP1 and TMEM41B are essential for DMV formation during β-coronavirus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35536318/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;β-coronaviruses reshape host cell endomembranes to form double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) for genome replication and transcription. Ectopically expressed viral nonstructural proteins nsp3 and nsp4 interact to zipper and bend the ER for DMV biogenesis. Genome-wide screens revealed the autophagy proteins VMP1 and TMEM41B as important host factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrated that DMV biogenesis, induced by virus infection or expression of nsp3/4, is impaired in the VMP1 KO or TMEM41B KO cells. In VMP1 KO cells, the nsp3/4 complex forms normally, but the zippered ER fails to close into DMVs. In TMEM41B KO cells, the nsp3-nsp4 interaction is reduced and DMV formation is suppressed. Thus, VMP1 and TMEM41B function at different steps during DMV formation. VMP1 was shown to regulate cross-membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) distribution. Inhibiting PS synthesis partially rescues the DMV defects in VMP1 KO cells, suggesting that PS participates in DMV formation. We provide molecular insights into the collaboration of host factors with viral proteins to remodel host organelles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of lung endothelial cells identifies dynamic inflammatory and regenerative subpopulations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have demonstrated the phenotypic heterogeneity of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) within a vascular bed; however, little is known about how distinct endothelial subpopulations in a particular organ respond to an inflammatory stimulus. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq of 35,973 lung ECs obtained during baseline as well as postinjury time points after inflammatory lung injury induced by LPS. Seurat clustering and gene expression pathway analysis identified 2 major subpopulations in the lung microvascular endothelium, a subpopulation enriched for expression of immune response genes such as MHC genes (immuneEC) and another defined by increased expression of vascular development genes such as Sox17 (devEC). The presence of immuneEC and devEC subpopulations was also observed in nonhuman primate lungs infected with SARS-CoV-2 and murine lungs infected with H1N1 influenza virus. After the peak of inflammatory injury, we observed the emergence of a proliferative lung EC subpopulation. Overexpression of Sox17 prevented inflammatory activation in ECs. Thus, there appeared to be a &amp;ldquo;division of labor&amp;rdquo; within the lung microvascular endothelium in which some ECs showed propensity for inflammatory signaling and others for endothelial regeneration.

      <title>Influenza A virus NS1 protein hijacks YAP/TAZ to suppress TLR3-mediated innate immune response</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hippo signaling pathway, which is historically considered as a dominator of organ development and homeostasis has recently been implicated as an immune regulator. However, its role in host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) has not been widely investigated. Here, we found that IAV could activate the Hippo effectors Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) through physical binding of the IAV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) with C-terminal domain of YAP/TAZ, facilitating their nuclear location. Meanwhile, YAP/TAZ downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral cytokines against IAV infection, therefore benefiting virus replication and host cell apoptosis. A mouse model of IAV infection further demonstrated Yap deficiency protected mice against IAV infection, relieving lung injury. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ blocked anti-viral innate immune signaling via downregulation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) expression. YAP directly bound to the putative TEADs binding site on the promoter region of TLR3. The elimination of acetylated histone H3 occupancy in the TLR3 promoter resulted in its transcriptional silence. Moreover, treatment of Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor or disruption of HDAC4/6 reversed the inhibition of TLR3 expression by YAP/TAZ, suggesting HDAC4/6 mediated the suppression function of YAP/TAZ. Taken together, we uncovered a novel immunomodulatory mechanism employed by IAV, where YAP/TAZ antagonize TLR3-mediated innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MARCH8 attenuates cGAS-mediated innate immune responses through ubiquitylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35503863/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) binds to microbial and self-DNA in the cytosol and synthesizes cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and downstream mediators to elicit an innate immune response. Regulation of cGAS activity is essential for immune homeostasis. Here, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 (also known as MARCHF8, c-MIR, and RNF178) as a negative regulator of cGAS-mediated signaling. The immune response to double-stranded DNA was attenuated by overexpression of MARCH8 and enhanced by knockdown or knockout of MARCH8. MARCH8 interacted with the enzymatically active core of cGAS through its conserved RING-CH domain and catalyzed the lysine-63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitylation of cGAS at Lys411. This polyubiquitylation event inhibited the DNA binding ability of cGAS, impaired cGAMP production, and attenuated the downstream innate immune response. Furthermore, March8-deficient mice were less susceptible than their wild-type counterparts to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. Together, our findings reveal a mechanism underlying the functional regulation of cGAS and the fine-tuning of the innate immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pathophysiological Role of Vimentin Intermediate Filaments in Lung Diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35573702/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vimentin intermediate filaments, a type III intermediate filament, are among the most widely studied IFs and are found abundantly in mesenchymal cells. Vimentin intermediate filaments localize primarily in the cytoplasm but can also be found on the cell surface and extracellular space. The cytoplasmic vimentin is well-recognized for its role in providing mechanical strength and regulating cell migration, adhesion, and division. The post-translationally modified forms of Vimentin intermediate filaments have several implications in host-pathogen interactions, cancers, and non-malignant lung diseases. This review will analyze the role of vimentin beyond just the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker highlighting its role as a regulator of host-pathogen interactions and signaling pathways for the pathophysiology of various lung diseases. In addition, we will also examine the clinically relevant anti-vimentin compounds and antibodies that could potentially interfere with the pathogenic role of Vimentin intermediate filaments in lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cul3-KLHL20 E3 ubiquitin ligase plays a key role in the arms race between HIV-1 Nef and host SERINC5 restriction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35474067/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIV-1 must counteract various host restrictions to establish productive infection. SERINC5 is a potent restriction factor that blocks HIV-1 entry from virions, but its activity is counteracted by Nef. The SERINC5 and Nef activities are both initiated from the plasma membrane, where SERINC5 is packaged into virions for viral inhibition or downregulated by Nef via lysosomal degradation. However, it is still unclear how SERINC5 is localized to and how its expression is regulated on the plasma membrane. We now report that Cullin 3-KLHL20, a &lt;em&gt;trans&lt;/em&gt;-Golgi network (TGN)-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase, polyubiquitinates SERINC5 at lysine 130 via K33/K48-linked ubiquitination. The K33-linked polyubiquitination determines SERINC5 expression on the plasma membrane, and the K48-linked polyubiquitination contributes to SERINC5 downregulation from the cell surface. Our study reveals an important role of K130 polyubiquitination and K33/K48-linked ubiquitin chains in HIV-1 infection by regulating SERINC5 post-Golgi trafficking and degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disrupting the HDAC6-ubiquitin interaction impairs infection by influenza and Zika virus and cellular stress pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35476995/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small synthetic protein (DARPin) blocks interaction between HDAC6 and ubiquitin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This DARPin impairs infection by influenza and Zika virus at the uncoating step&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both viruses contain ubiquitin associated with their capsid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DARPin also impacts the formation of aggresomes and stress granules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deacetylase HDAC6 has tandem catalytic domains and a zinc finger domain (ZnF) binding ubiquitin (Ub). While the catalytic domain has an antiviral effect, the ZnF facilitates influenza A virus (IAV) infection and cellular stress responses. By recruiting Ub via the ZnF, HDAC6 promotes the formation of aggresomes and stress granules (SGs), dynamic structures associated with pathologies such as neurodegeneration. IAV subverts the aggresome/HDAC6 pathway to facilitate capsid uncoating during early infection. To target this pathway, we generate designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) binding the ZnF; one of these prevents interaction with Ub in vitro and in cells. Crystallographic analysis shows that it blocks the ZnF pocket where Ub engages. Conditional expression of this DARPin reversibly impairs infection by IAV and Zika virus; moreover, SGs and aggresomes are downregulated. These results validate the HDAC6 ZnF as an attractive target for drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dynamic N6-methyladenosine modification of lncRNA modulated by METTL3 during bacterial disease development in an echinoderm</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35483599/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are novel functional non-coding RNAs which engaged in many aspects of biological processes. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) as a kind of abundant epitranscriptomic modification in eukaryotes, plays important roles in regulation of gene expression for various physiological functions. Our previous study demonstrated that sea cucumber lncRNAs were differentially expressed during bacterial infection. However, whether the post-transcriptional regulation of lncRNAs influenced by m6A modification in sea cucumbers with different stages of skin ulceration syndrome (SUS) are largely unknown. Here, we generated the genome-wide map of m6A lncRNAs in SUS-diseased and SUS-resistant sea cucumbers for the first time, revealed that m6A levels in lncRNAs were mainly upregulated in SUS-resistant group. Intriguingly, most of the m6A lncRNAs showed a positive correlation between the expression levels and m6A levels based on conjoint analysis, suggesting that m6A modification on a lncRNA may contribute to its RNA stability. Furthermore, the host genes of lncRNAs with dysregulated m6A peaks were enriched in immune pathway. More importantly, methyltransferase METTL3 was required for m6A methylation modification and played positive roles in lncRNA expression. Collectively, this study presents the comprehensive characters of m6A lncRNAs in marine invertebrate. These m6A modified lncRNAs may be served as potential regulators associated with SUS and provide a promising avenue for disease therapy through targeting METTL3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 infection of human-induced pluripotent stem cells-derived lung lineage cells evokes inflammatory and chemosensory responses by targeting mitochondrial pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35460571/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the lung, particularly the proximal airway and distal alveolar cells. NKX2.1+ primordial lung progenitors of the foregut (anterior) endoderm are the developmental precursors to all adult lung epithelial lineages and are postulated to play an important role in viral tropism. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 readily infected and replicated in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived proximal airway cells, distal alveolar cells, and lung progenitors. In addition to the upregulation of antiviral defense and immune responses, transcriptomics data uncovered a robust epithelial cell-specific response, including perturbation of metabolic processes and disruption in the alveolar maturation program. We also identified spatiotemporal dysregulation of mitochondrial heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), which is associated with defense against antioxidant-induced lung injury. Cytokines, such as TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-6, and IL-13, were upregulated in infected cells sparking mitochondrial ROS production and change in electron transport chain complexes. Increased mitochondrial ROS then activated additional proinflammatory cytokines leading to an aberrant cell cycle resulting in apoptosis. Notably, we are the first to report a chemosensory response resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection similar to that seen in COVID-19 patients. Some of our key findings were validated using COVID-19-affected postmortem lung tissue sections. These results suggest that our in vitro system could serve as a suitable model to investigate the pathogenetic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to discover and test therapeutic drugs against COVID-19 or its consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cytoplasmic PARP1 links the genome instability to the inhibition of antiviral immunity through PARylating cGAS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNA damage induces the cytosolic translocation of PARP1 in an iNOS-dependent manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNA-PK phosphorylates PARP1 on Thr&lt;sup&gt;594&lt;/sup&gt; and instructs its cytosolic translocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PARP1 PARylates human cGAS on D191 or mouse cGAS on E176 to terminate its DNA binding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PARP1-mediated PARylation of cGAS inhibits antiviral immunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virus infection modulates both host immunity and host genomic stability. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a key nuclear sensor of DNA damage, which maintains genomic integrity, and the successful application of PARP1 inhibitors for clinical anti-cancer therapy has lasted for decades. However, precisely how PARP1 gains access to cytoplasm and regulates antiviral immunity remains unknown. Here, we report that DNA virus induces a reactive nitrogen species (RNS)-dependent DNA damage and activates DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Activated DNA-PK phosphorylates PARP1 on Thr&lt;sup&gt;594&lt;/sup&gt;, thus facilitating the cytoplasmic translocation of PARP1 to inhibit the antiviral immunity both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, cytoplasmic PARP1 interacts with and directly PARylates cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) on Asp&lt;sup&gt;191&lt;/sup&gt; to inhibit its DNA-binding ability. Together, our findings uncover an essential role of PARP1 in linking virus-induced genome instability with inhibition of host immunity, which is of relevance to cancer, autoinflammation, and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutralization and receptor use of infectious culture-derived rat hepacivirus as a model for HCV</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35445423/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Lack of tractable immunocompetent animal models amenable to robust experimental challenge impedes vaccine efforts for HCV. Infection with rodent hepacivirus from Rattus norvegicus (RHV-rn1) in rats shares HCV-defining characteristics, including liver tropism, chronicity, and pathology. RHV &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; cultivation would facilitate genetic studies on particle production, host factor interactions, and evaluation of antibody neutralization guiding HCV vaccine approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt; We report an infectious reverse genetic cell culture system for RHV-rn1 using highly permissive rat hepatoma cells and adaptive mutations in the E2, NS4B, and NS5A viral proteins. Cell culture-derived RHV-rn1 particles (RHVcc) share hallmark biophysical characteristics of HCV and are infectious in mice and rats. Culture adaptive mutations attenuated RHVcc in immunocompetent rats, and the mutations reverted following prolonged infection, but not in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, suggesting that adaptive immune pressure is a primary driver of reversion. Accordingly, sera from RHVcc-infected SCID mice or the early acute phase of immunocompetent mice and rats were infectious in culture. We further established an &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; RHVcc neutralization assay, and observed neutralizing activity of rat sera specifically from the chronic phase of infection. Finally, we found that scavenger receptor class B type I promoted RHV-rn1 entry &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The RHV-rn1 infectious cell culture system enables studies of humoral immune responses against hepacivirus infection. Moreover, recapitulation of the entire RHV-rn1 infectious cycle in cell culture will facilitate reverse genetic studies and the exploration of tropism and virus-host interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Development of a method (PANINI) for multiplexed nucleic acid and protein imaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identification of orchestrated immune events in response to SIV infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-10 levels in B cells and macrophages correlate with immunosuppression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tissue microenvironmental cues can influence SIV viral transcription state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the mechanisms of HIV tissue persistence necessitates the ability to visualize tissue microenvironments where infected cells reside; however, technological barriers limit our ability to dissect the cellular components of these HIV reservoirs. Here, we developed protein and nucleic acid in situ imaging (PANINI) to simultaneously quantify DNA, RNA, and protein levels within these tissue compartments. By coupling PANINI with multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), we measured over 30 parameters simultaneously across archival lymphoid tissues from healthy or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected nonhuman primates. PANINI enabled the spatial dissection of cellular phenotypes, functional markers, and viral events resulting from infection. SIV infection induced IL-10 expression in lymphoid B cells, which correlated with local macrophage M2 polarization. This highlights a potential viral mechanism for conditioning an immunosuppressive tissue environment for virion production. The spatial multimodal framework here can be extended to decipher tissue responses in other infectious diseases and tumor biology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Therapeutic stem cell-derived alveolar-like macrophages display bactericidal effects and resolve Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial lung infections lead to greater than 4 million deaths per year with antibiotic treatments driving an increase in antibiotic resistance and a need to establish new therapeutic approaches. Recently, we have generated mouse and rat stem cell-derived alveolar-like macrophages (ALMs), which like primary alveolar macrophages (1&amp;rsquo;AMs), phagocytose bacteria and promote airway repair. Our aim was to further characterize ALMs and determine their bactericidal capabilities. The characterization of ALMs showed that they share known 1&amp;rsquo;AM cell surface markers, but unlike 1&amp;rsquo;AMs are highly proliferative in vitro. ALMs effectively phagocytose and kill laboratory strains of P. aeruginosa (P.A.), E. coli (E.C.) and S. aureus, and clinical strains of P.A. In vivo, ALMs remain viable, adapt additional features of native 1&amp;rsquo;AMs, but proliferation is reduced. Mouse ALMs phagocytose P.A. and E.C. and rat ALMs phagocytose and kill P.A. within the lung 24 h post-instillation. In a pre-clinical model of P.A.-induced lung injury, rat ALM administration mitigated weight loss and resolved lung injury observed seven days post-instillation. Collectively, ALMs attenuate pulmonary bacterial infections and promote airway repair. ALMs could be utilized as an alternative or adjuvant therapy where current treatments are ineffective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria or to enhance routine antibiotic delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alveolar macrophage-derived NRP2 curtails lung injury while boosting host defense in bacterial pneumonia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35435271/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearance of airway intruders by immune cells is required to resolve infectious pneumonia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Here, we demonstrated that alveolar macrophage (AM)-derived neuropilin 2 (NRP2) plays an essential role in controlling severe pneumonia by enhancing microbial clearance. Mice with conditional deletion of the &lt;em&gt;NRP2&lt;/em&gt; gene in AM had persistent bacteria, uncontrolled neutrophil influx, and decreased survival during &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;-induced pneumonia. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; assays demonstrated that NRP2 could bind to CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6G&lt;sup&gt;lo/+&lt;/sup&gt; neutrophils and promote their capacities in phagocytosis and killing of bacteria, which is partially contributed to the increased expression of &lt;em&gt;TLR4&lt;/em&gt; and TNF-α. These findings collectively revealed that AM-derived NRP2 protects the lungs from unwanted injury by promoting the clearance of invading pathogens. This study might provide a promising diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for severe pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>cGAS modulates cytokine secretion and bacterial burdens by altering the release of mitochondrial DNA in pseudomonas pulmonary infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35420160/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is essential for fighting against viruses and bacteria, but how cGAS is involved in host immune response remains largely elusive. Here, we uncover the crucial role of cGAS in host immunity based on a &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; pulmonary infection model. &lt;em&gt;cGAS&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice showed more heavy bacterial burdens and serious lung injury accompanied with exorbitant proinflammatory cytokines than wild-type mice. cGAS deficiency caused an accumulation of mitochondrial DNA in the cytoplasm, which, in turn, induced excessive secretion of proinflammatory factors by activating inflammasome and TLR9 signalling. Mechanistically, cGAS deficiency inhibited the recruitment of LC3 by reducing the binding capacity of TBK-1 to p62, leading to impaired mitophagy and augmented release of mitochondrial DNA. Importantly, cytoplasmic mitochondrial DNA also acted as a feedback signal that induced the activation of cGAS. Altogether, these findings identify protective and homeostasis functions of cGAS against &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; infection, adding significant insight into the pathogenesis of bacterial infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aedes aegypti sialokinin facilitates mosquito blood feeding and modulates host immunity and vascular biology</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35417706/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vasodilator sialokinin induces nitric oxide release similarly to substance P&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sialokinin KO mosquitoes shows lower blood perfusion and longer probing time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sialokinin interferes with host hemostasis via NK1R signaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sialokinin promotes endothelial permeability and leukocyte recruitment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saliva from mosquitoes contains vasodilators that antagonize vasoconstrictors produced at the bite site. Sialokinin is a vasodilator present in the saliva of &lt;em&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/em&gt;. Here, we investigate its function and describe its mechanism of action during blood feeding. Sialokinin induces nitric oxide release similar to substance P. Sialokinin-KO mosquitoes produce lower blood perfusion than parental mosquitoes at the bite site during probing and have significantly longer probing times, which result in lower blood feeding success. In contrast, there is no difference in feeding between KO and parental mosquitoes when using artificial membrane feeders or mice that are treated with a substance P receptor antagonist, confirming that sialokinin interferes with host hemostasis via NK1R signaling. While sialokinin-KO saliva does not affect virus infection in vitro, it stimulates macrophages and inhibits leukocyte recruitment in vivo. This work highlights the biological functionality of salivary proteins in blood feeding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HIV-1 Vpr drives a tissue residency-like phenotype during selective infection of resting memory T cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35417711/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cell-to-cell spread makes resting CD4+ T cells permissive to HIV-1 infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resting memory T cells are productively infected by HIV-1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HIV-1 Vpr drives resting memory T cells to gain characteristics of tissue residency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vpr induces widespread transcriptional reprogramming of infected T cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIV-1 replicates in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, leading to AIDS. Determining how HIV-1 shapes its niche to create a permissive environment is central to informing efforts to limit pathogenesis, disturb reservoirs, and achieve a cure. A key roadblock in understanding HIV-T cell interactions is the requirement to activate T cells in vitro to make them permissive to infection. This dramatically alters T cell biology and virus-host interactions. Here we show that HIV-1 cell-to-cell spread permits efficient, productive infection of resting memory T cells without prior activation. Strikingly, we find that HIV-1 infection primes resting T cells to gain characteristics of tissue-resident memory T cells (T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;), including upregulating key surface markers and the transcription factor Blimp-1 and inducing a transcriptional program overlapping the core T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; transcriptional signature. This reprogramming is driven by Vpr and requires Vpr packaging into virions and manipulation of STAT5. Thus, HIV-1 reprograms resting T cells, with implications for viral replication and persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distinct Role of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in Protective Immunity Against Orientia tsutsugamushi Infection in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35479068/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infection with &lt;em&gt;Orientia tsutsugamushi&lt;/em&gt;, an obligate intracellular bacterium, can cause mild or severe scrub typhus. Some patients develop acute lung injury, multi-organ failure, and fatal infection; however, little is known regarding key immune mediators that mediate infection control or disease pathogenesis. Using murine models of scrub typhus, we demonstrated in this study the requirement of TNF-TNFR signaling in protective immunity against this infection. Mice lacking both TNF receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2) were highly susceptible to &lt;em&gt;O. tsutsugamushi&lt;/em&gt; infection, displaying significantly increased tissue bacterial burdens and succumbing to infection by day 9, while most wild-type mice survived through day 20. This increased susceptibility correlated with poor activation of cellular immunity in inflamed tissues. Flow cytometry of lung- and spleen-derived cells revealed profound deficiencies in total numbers and activation status of NK cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, as well as CD4 and CD8 T cells. To define the role of individual receptors in &lt;em&gt;O. tsutsugamushi&lt;/em&gt; infection, we used mice lacking either TNFR1 or TNFR2. While deficiency in either receptor alone was sufficient to increase host susceptibility to the infection, TNFR1 and TNFR2 played a distinct role in cellular responses. TNF signaling through TNFR1 promoted inflammatory responses and effector T cell expansion, while TNFR2 signaling was associated with anti-inflammatory action and tissue homeostasis. Moreover, TNFRs played an intrinsic role in CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell activation, revealing an indispensable role of TNF in protective immunity against &lt;em&gt;O. tsutsugamushi&lt;/em&gt; infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AMG487 inhibits PRRSV replication and ameliorates lung injury in pig lung xenografts by down-regulating the expression of ANXA2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35405171/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a pig disease caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV) that is characterized with diffuse interstitial pneumonia and lung edema. High expressions of chemokine CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 are reported in infected porcine lungs. Since CXCR3 is a key player in host inflammatory response, it might be a therapeutic target to treat lung damage caused by PRRSV infection. The size of pigs has long hampered research into molecular mechanisms of PRRS and validating the potential pharmaceutical targets. In this study, a porcine lung xenograft model with PRRSV infection was generated in immunodeficient mice to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 on PRRSV infection-induced lung injury. The porcine lung tissues developed normally two weeks after xeno-transplantation in the mouse kidney capsule. Infection of PRRSV resulted in its efficient replication in the xenografts and histological damage to the porcine lung tissue structure, with no or little effects on mouse lungs. AMG487 administration dramatically reduced the number of PRRSV genome copies and significantly alleviated the porcine lung injury. Furthermore, treatment of AMG487 in cultured porcine macrophages consistently suppressed PRRSV replication with significant downregulation of Annexin A2 (ANXA2), a cellular protein facilitating viral replication. These findings provide a suitable model for evaluating new antiviral therapies as well as a possible therapeutic option for virus infection-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 impairs the disassembly of stress granules and promotes ALS-associated amyloid aggregation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35384603/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to have a high ability of liquid-liquid phase separation, which enables its incorporation into stress granules (SGs) of host cells. However, whether SG invasion by N protein occurs in the scenario of SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknow, neither do we know its consequence. Here, we used SARS-CoV-2 to infect mammalian cells and observed the incorporation of N protein into SGs, which resulted in markedly impaired self-disassembly but stimulated cell cellular clearance of SGs. NMR experiments further showed that N protein binds to the SG-related amyloid proteins via non-specific transient interactions, which not only expedites the phase transition of these proteins to aberrant amyloid aggregation in vitro, but also promotes the aggregation of FUS with ALS-associated P525L mutation in cells. In addition, we found that ACE2 is not necessary for the infection of SARS-CoV-2 to mammalian cells. Our work indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can impair the disassembly of host SGs and promote the aggregation of SG-related amyloid proteins, which may lead to an increased risk of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>APOL1 Risk Variants, Acute Kidney Injury, and Death in Participants With African Ancestry Hospitalized With COVID-19 From the Million Veteran Program</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35089317/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Importance:&lt;/em&gt; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) confers significant risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Patients with COVID-19 with AKI have high mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Individuals with African ancestry with 2 copies of apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) variants G1 or G2 (high-risk group) have significantly increased rates of kidney disease. We tested the hypothesis that the APOL1 high-risk group is associated with a higher-risk of COVID-19-associated AKI and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design, setting, and participants:&lt;/em&gt; This retrospective cohort study included 990 participants with African ancestry enrolled in the Million Veteran Program who were hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 2020 and January 2021 with available genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exposures:&lt;/em&gt; The primary exposure was having 2 APOL1 risk variants (RV) (APOL1 high-risk group), compared with having 1 or 0 risk variants (APOL1 low-risk group).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main outcomes and measures:&lt;/em&gt; The primary outcome was AKI. The secondary outcomes were stages of AKI severity and death. Multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for preexisting comorbidities, medications, and inpatient AKI risk factors; 10 principal components of ancestry were performed to study these associations. We performed a subgroup analysis in individuals with normal kidney function prior to hospitalization (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Of the 990 participants with African ancestry, 905 (91.4%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 68 (60-73) years. Overall, 392 (39.6%) patients developed AKI, 141 (14%) developed stages 2 or 3 AKI, 28 (3%) required dialysis, and 122 (12.3%) died. One hundred twenty-five (12.6%) of the participants were in the APOL1 high-risk group. Patients categorized as APOL1 high-risk group had significantly higher odds of AKI (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.95; 95% CI, 1.27-3.02; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .002), higher AKI severity stages (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.37-2.99; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001), and death (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.22-3.72; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .007). The association with AKI persisted in the subgroup with normal kidney function (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.15-3.26; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .01). Data analysis was conducted between February 2021 and April 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions and relevance:&lt;/em&gt; In this cohort study of veterans with African ancestry hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, APOL1 kidney risk variants were associated with higher odds of AKI, AKI severity, and death, even among individuals with prior normal kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;

To address how NTM infection is established and causes lung damage, we established an NTM mouse model by intranasal inoculation of clinical isolates of &lt;em&gt;M. intracellulare&lt;/em&gt;. During the 39-week course of infection, the bacteria persistently grew in the lung and caused progressive granulomatous and fibrotic lung damage with mortality exceeding 50%. Lung neutrophils were significantly increased at 1 week postinfection, reduced at 2 weeks postinfection and increased again at 39 weeks postinfection. IL-17A was increased in the lungs at 1-2 weeks of infection and reduced at 3 weeks postinfection. Depletion of neutrophils during early (0-2 weeks) and late (32-34 weeks) infection had no effect on mortality or lung damage in chronically infected mice. However, neutralization of IL-17A during early infection significantly reduced bacterial burden, fibrotic lung damage, and mortality in chronically infected mice. Since it is known that IL-17A regulates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and that MMPs contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, we determined the levels of MMPs in the lungs of &lt;em&gt;M. intracellulare&lt;/em&gt;-infected mice. Interestingly, MMP-3 was significantly reduced by anti-IL-17A neutralizing antibody. Moreover, in vitro data showed that exogenous IL-17A exaggerated the production of MMP-3 by lung epithelial cells upon &lt;em&gt;M. intracellulare&lt;/em&gt; infection. Collectively, our findings suggest that early IL-17A production precedes and promotes organized pulmonary &lt;em&gt;M. intracellulare&lt;/em&gt; infection in mice, at least in part through MMP-3 production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chrysin Ameliorates Influenza Virus Infection in the Upper Airways by Repressing Virus-Induced Cell Cycle Arrest and Mitochondria-Dependent Apoptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35432374/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrysin has been proven to possess antiviral properties, but the precise underlying anti-influenza mechanism and its anti-influenza efficacy in vivo are largely unclear. In this study, we investigated the involvement of chrysin in the blockade of cell cycle and apoptosis in distinct cell lines subjected to two H1N1 influenza A virus (IAV) strains, as well as its anti-IAV activity in vivo. Here, we found an early unidentified finding that chrysin strongly impeded IAV replication through a mechanism that was autonomous of innate antiviral immune activation and viral protein interaction. Surprisingly, chrysin can suppress IAV-induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase by downregulating the expression levels of P53 and P21 while promoting Cyclin D1/CDK4 and Cyclin E1/CDK2 activation. Furthermore, chrysin dramatically inhibited the IAV-triggered mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by altering the balance of Bax/Bcl-xl and reducing caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. Accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduction may contribute to the inhibitory role of chrysin in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following IAV infection. Notably, chrysin preferably inhibited IAV replication in the upper respiratory tract, indicating that it might be a promising drug for restraining the spread of respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acute Kidney Injury Interacts With Coma, Acidosis, and Impaired Perfusion to Significantly Increase Risk of Death in Children With Severe Malaria</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35349633/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Mortality in severe malaria remains high in children treated with intravenous artesunate. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of severe malaria, but the interactions between AKI and other complications on the risk of mortality in severe malaria are not well characterized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Between 2014 and 2017, 600 children aged 6-48 months to 4 years hospitalized with severe malaria were enrolled in a prospective clinical cohort study evaluating clinical predictors of mortality in children with severe malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The mean age of children in this cohort was 2.1 years (standard deviation, 0.9 years) and 338 children (56.3%) were male. Mortality was 7.3%, and 52.3% of deaths occurred within 12 hours of admission. Coma, acidosis, impaired perfusion, AKI, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and hyperkalemia were associated with increased mortality (all &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001). AKI interacted with each risk factor to increase mortality (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001 for interaction). Children with clinical indications for dialysis (14.4% of all children) had an increased risk of death compared with those with no indications for dialysis (odds ratio, 6.56; 95% confidence interval, 3.41-12.59).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; AKI interacts with coma, acidosis, or impaired perfusion to significantly increase the risk of death in severe malaria. Among children with AKI, those who have hyperkalemia or elevated BUN have a higher risk of death. A better understanding of the causes of these complications of severe malaria, and development and implementation of measures to prevent and treat them, such as dialysis, are needed to reduce mortality in severe malaria.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mouse circulating extracellular vesicles contain virus-derived siRNAs active in antiviral immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35343600/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Induction and suppression of antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) has been observed in mammals during infection with at least seven distinct RNA viruses, including some that are pathogenic in humans. However, while the cell-autonomous immune response mediated by antiviral RNAi is gradually being recognized, little is known about systemic antiviral RNAi in mammals. Furthermore, extracellular vesicles (EVs) also function in viral signal spreading and host immunity. Here, we show that upon antiviral RNAi activation, virus-derived small-interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) from Nodamura virus (NoV), Sindbis virus (SINV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) enter the murine bloodstream via EVs for systemic circulation. vsiRNAs in the EVs are biologically active, since they confer RNA-RNA homology-dependent antiviral activity in both cultured cells and infant mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that vaccination with a live-attenuated virus, rendered deficient in RNAi suppression, induces production of stably maintained vsiRNAs and confers protective immunity against virus infection in mice. This suggests that vaccination with live-attenuated VSR (viral suppressor of RNAi)-deficient mutant viruses could be a new strategy to induce immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Avian influenza viruses suppress innate immunity by inducing trans-transcriptional readthrough via SSU72</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35332300/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate immunity plays critical antiviral roles. The highly virulent avian influenza viruses (AIVs) H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6 can better escape host innate immune responses than the less virulent seasonal H1N1 virus. Here, we report a mechanism by which transcriptional readthrough (TRT)-mediated suppression of innate immunity occurs post AIV infection. By using cell lines, mouse lungs, and patient PBMCs, we showed that genes on the complementary strand (&amp;ldquo;trans&amp;rdquo; genes) influenced by TRT were involved in the disruption of host antiviral responses during AIV infection. The trans-TRT enhanced viral lethality, and TRT abolishment increased cell viability and STAT1/2 expression. The viral NS1 protein directly bound to SSU72, and degradation of SSU72 induced TRT. SSU72 overexpression reduced TRT and alleviated mouse lung injury. Our results suggest that AIVs infection induce TRT by reducing SSU72 expression, thereby impairing host immune responses, a molecular mechanism acting through the NS1-SSU72-trans-TRT-STAT1/2 axis. Thus, restoration of SSU72 expression might be a potential strategy for preventing AIV pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Possible Impact of LPS and (1→3)-β-D-glucan in Blood from Gut Translocation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35406667/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to limited data on the link between gut barrier defects (leaky gut) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), blood samples of COVID-19 cases-mild (upper respiratory tract symptoms without pneumonia; n = 27), moderate (pneumonia without hypoxia; n = 28), and severe (pneumonia with hypoxia; n = 20)-versus healthy control (n = 15) were evaluated, together with in vitro experiments. Accordingly, neutrophil counts, serum cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacteria-free DNA, and NETs parameters (fluorescent-stained nuclear morphology, dsDNA, neutrophil elastase, histone-DNA complex, and myeloperoxidase-DNA complex) were found to differentiate COVID-19 severity, whereas serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) was different between the control and COVID-19 cases. Despite non-detectable bacteria-free DNA in the blood of healthy volunteers, using blood bacteriome analysis, proteobacterial DNA was similarly predominant in both control and COVID-19 cases (all severities). In parallel, only COVID-19 samples from moderate and severe cases, but not mild cases, were activated in vitro NETs, as determined by supernatant dsDNA, &lt;em&gt;Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase 4&lt;/em&gt;, and nuclear morphology. With neutrophil experiments, LPS plus BG (LPS + BG) more prominently induced NETs, cytokines, NFκB, and reactive oxygen species, when compared with the activation by each molecule alone. In conclusion, pathogen molecules (LPS and BG) from gut translocation along with neutrophilia and cytokinemia in COVID-19-activated, NETs-induced hyperinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) Promotes Staphylococcus aureus-Induced Extracellular Traps Formation via the ROS-ERK Signaling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35399524/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a cytosolic DNA sensor or directly recognizes bacterial cyclic dinucleotides, which is required for the detection of microbial infection. Extracellular traps (ETs) are known to be part of the antimicrobial defense system. However, the implication of STING in ETs formation during microbial infection remains unknown. Here, we showed that STING contributed to &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;)-induced ETs formation through the ROS-ERK signaling. STING deficiency exhibited decreased cell-free DNA (cfDNA) level, reduced expression of citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), and diminished DNA colocalization with CitH3 and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Interestingly, NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoted ETs formation, accompanied by increased activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Corresponding to less ROS production, decreased ERK1/2 activation was shown in STING-/- BMDMs after &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Importantly, inhibiting the ROS-ERK signal reduced the ETs formation and the differences disappeared between WT and STING&lt;sup&gt;-/&lt;/sup&gt;- BMDMs after &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Moreover, STING&lt;sup&gt;-/&lt;/sup&gt; BMDMs exhibited significantly increased levels of extracellular bacteria compared to WT BMDMs regardless of phagocytosis. In addition, such differences disappeared after DNase I treatment. DNase I treatment also facilitated pathogen colonization without affecting the inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory factors secretion following pulmonary &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Furthermore, STING&lt;sup&gt;-/&lt;/sup&gt; mice presented decreased levels of cfDNA and CitH3, along with increased bacterial colonization compared to WT mice. Altogether, these findings highlighted that STING promoted ETs formation via the ROS-ERK signal for host defense against &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epithelial LIF signaling limits apoptosis and lung injury during bacterial pneumonia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35137631/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During bacterial pneumonia, alveolar epithelial cells are critical for maintaining gas exchange and providing antimicrobial as well as pro-immune properties. We previously demonstrated that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an IL-6 family cytokine, is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATII) and is critical for tissue protection during bacterial pneumonia. However, the target cells and mechanisms of LIF-mediated protection remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that antibody-induced LIF blockade remodels the lung epithelial transcriptome in association with increased apoptosis. Based on these data, we performed pneumonia studies using a novel mouse model in which LIFR (the unique receptor for LIF) is absent in lung epithelium. Although LIFR is expressed on the surface of epithelial cells, its absence only minimally contributed to tissue protection during pneumonia. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) was conducted to identify adult murine lung cell types most prominently expressing &lt;em&gt;Lifr&lt;/em&gt;, revealing endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and ATIIs as major sources of &lt;em&gt;Lifr&lt;/em&gt;. Sequencing data indicated that ATII cells were significantly impacted by pneumonia, with additional differences observed in response to LIF neutralization, including but not limited to gene programs related to cell death, injury, and inflammation. Overall, our data suggest that LIF signaling on epithelial cells alters responses in this cell type during pneumonia. However, our results also suggest separate and perhaps more prominent roles of LIFR in other cell types, such as endothelial cells or mesenchymal cells, which provide grounds for future investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MetOrigin: Discriminating the origins of microbial metabolites for integrative analysis of the gut microbiome and metabolome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/imt2.10/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactions between the gut microbiome and metabolome play an important role in human health and diseases. Current studies mainly apply statistical correlation analysis between the gut microbiome and all the identified metabolites to explore their relationship. However, it remains challenging to identify the specific metabolic functions of microbes without in vitro culture experiments for validation. Discriminating the microbial metabolites from others (e.g., host, food, or environment) and exploring their metabolic functions and correlations with microbiome specifically may improve the efficiency and accuracy of biomarker discovery. So far, there have been no such bioinformatics tools available. Herein, we developed &lt;a href=&#34;http://metorigin.met-bioinformatics.cn/home/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MetOrigin&lt;/a&gt;, an interactive web server that discriminates metabolites originating from the microbiome, performs the origin-based metabolic pathway enrichment analysis, and integrates the statistical correlations and biological relationships in the database using Sankey network visualization. &lt;a href=&#34;http://metorigin.met-bioinformatics.cn/home/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MetOrigin&lt;/a&gt; not only enables the quick identification of microbial metabolites and their metabolic functions but also facilitates the discovery of specific bacterial species that are closely associated with metabolites statistically and biologically.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ZDHHC18 negatively regulates cGAS-mediated innate immunity through palmitoylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35438208/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-stranded DNA is recognized as a danger signal by cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS), triggering innate immune responses. Palmitoylation is an important post-translational modification (PTM) catalyzed by DHHC-palmitoyl transferases, which participate in the regulation of diverse biological processes. However, whether palmitoylation regulates cGAS function has not yet been explored. Here, we found that palmitoylation of cGAS at C474 restricted its enzymatic activity in the presence of double-stranded DNA. cGAS palmitoylation was catalyzed mainly by the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC18 and double-stranded DNA promoted this modification. Mechanistically, palmitoylation of cGAS reduced the interaction between cGAS and double-stranded DNA, further inhibiting cGAS dimerization. Consistently, ZDHHC18 negatively regulated cGAS activation in human and mouse cell lines. In a more biologically relevant model system, Zdhhc18-deficient mice were found to be resistant to infection by DNA viruses, in agreement with the observation that ZDHHC18 negatively regulated cGAS mediated innate immune responses in human and mouse primary cells. In summary, the negative role of ZDHHC18-mediated cGAS palmitoylation may be a novel regulatory mechanism in the fine-tuning of innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has incited a global health crisis. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We evaluated the antiviral activity of sulforaphane (SFN), the principal biologically active phytochemical derived from glucoraphanin, the naturally occurring precursor present in high concentrations in cruciferous vegetables. SFN inhibited in vitro replication of six strains of SARS-CoV-2, including Delta and Omicron, as well as that of the seasonal coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Further, SFN and remdesivir interacted synergistically to inhibit coronavirus infection in vitro. Prophylactic administration of SFN to K18-hACE2 mice prior to intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly decreased the viral load in the lungs and upper respiratory tract and reduced lung injury and pulmonary pathology compared to untreated infected mice. SFN treatment diminished immune cell activation in the lungs, including significantly lower recruitment of myeloid cells and a reduction in T cell activation and cytokine production. Our results suggest that SFN should be explored as a potential agent for the prevention or treatment of coronavirus infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-6 Prevents Lung Macrophage Death and Lung Inflammation Injury by Inhibiting GSDME- and GSDMD-Mediated Pyroptosis during Pneumococcal Pneumosepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35297653/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumococcal pneumonia has been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout human history. Failing to control pneumococcal pneumonia and resolve ongoing inflammation in a host can cause sepsis, namely pneumococcal pneumosepsis, and death ensues. Few theories have suggested an optimally therapeutic option for this infectious disease. The interleukin-6 (IL-6, a cytokine featuring pleiotropic activity) theory, proposed here, implies that IL-6 acts as a protector against pneumococcal pneumosepsis. IL-6 prevents lung macrophage death and lung inflammation injury by inhibiting a caspase-3-GSDME-mediated switch from apoptosis to pyroptosis and inhibiting caspase-1-GSDMD-mediated classic pyroptosis during pneumococcal pneumosepsis. Thus, IL-6 is an important determinant for controlling bacterial invasion and a homeostatic coordinator of pneumococcal pneumosepsis. This study clarifies a novel mechanism of occurrence and development of pneumonia and secondary sepsis following a Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. It is important for the early identification and treatment of pneumococcal pneumosepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NLRC4 Deficiency Leads to Enhanced Phosphorylation of MLKL and Necroptosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosts rely on the innate immune system to clear pathogens in response to infection. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns bind to innate immune receptors and engage activation of downstream signaling to initiate a host immune response to fight infection. A key component of this innate response is programmed cell death. Recent work has highlighted significant cross-talk and functional redundancy between cell death pathways, leading to the discovery of PANoptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death pathway dependent on PANoptosomes, which are innate immune danger-sensing complexes that activate inflammatory cell death and contain caspases with or without inflammasome components and receptor interacting protein homotypic interaction motif-containing proteins. Although PANoptosis has been characterized in response to a growing number of pathogens, inflammatory diseases, and cancer, its role and the functional consequences of PANoptotic component modulation during NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4) activation by &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; infection remain unknown. In this study, we show that P. aeruginosa can induce PANoptosis in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Only the combined deletion of caspase-1, -11, -8, and RIPK3 protected mouse BMDMs from cell death. Moreover, we showed that PANoptotic components act in a compensatory manner; in the absence of NAIP5 and NLRC4 during P. aeruginosa challenge, activation of caspase-1, -3, -7, and -8 was reduced, whereas alternative cell death molecules such as RIPK1 and MLKL were activated in mouse BMDMs. Taken together, these data highlight the extensive cross-talk between cell death signaling molecules and showcase the plasticity of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Replication is the key barrier during the dual-host adaptation of mosquito-borne flaviviruses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35294288/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most viruses have a relatively narrow host range. In contrast, vector-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus, maintain their transmission cycle between arthropods and vertebrates, belonging to different phyla. How do these viruses adapt to the distinct cellular environments of two phyla? By comparing the single-host insect&amp;ndash;specific flavivirus and dual-host Zika virus, we identified three key molecular factors that determine MBF host tropism. This study will greatly increase the understanding of entry, replication, and cross-species evolution of mosquito-borne flaviviruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFs) adapt to a dual-host transmission circle between mosquitoes and vertebrates. Dual-host affiliated insect-specific flaviviruses (dISFs), discovered from mosquitoes, are phylogenetically similar to MBFs but do not infect vertebrates. Thus, dISF–MBF chimeras could be an ideal model to study the dual-host adaptation of MBFs. Using the pseudoinfectious reporter virus particle and reverse genetics systems, we found dISFs entered vertebrate cells as efficiently as the MBFs but failed to initiate replication. Exchange of the untranslational regions (UTRs) of Donggang virus (DONV), a dISF, with those from Zika virus (ZIKV) rescued DONV replication in vertebrate cells, and critical secondary RNA structures were further mapped. Essential UTR-binding host factors were screened for ZIKV replication in vertebrate cells, displaying different binding patterns. Therefore, our data demonstrate a post-entry cross-species transmission mechanism of MBFs, while UTR-host interaction is critical for dual-host adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Syk Facilitates Influenza A Virus Replication by Restraining Innate Immunity at the Late Stage of Viral Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35293768/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has recently come forth as a critical regulator of innate immune response. Previous studies identify Syk as a key kinase for STAT1 activation at the early stage of influenza A virus (IAV) infection that is involved in initial antiviral immunity. However, the involvement of Syk in host antiviral immunity during the late phase of IAV infection and its effect on pathogenesis of the virus remain unknown. Here, we found through time course studies that Syk restrained antiviral immune response at the late stage of IAV infection, thereby promoting viral replication. Depletion of Syk suppressed IAV replication &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, whereas ectopic expression of Syk facilitated viral replication. Moreover, Syk-deficient mice were employed, and we observed that knockout of Syk rendered mice more resistant to IAV infection, as evidenced by a lower degree of lung injury, slower body weight loss, and an increased survival rate of Syk knockout mice challenged with IAV. Furthermore, we revealed that Syk repressed the interferon response at the late stage of viral infection. Loss of Syk potentiated the expression of type I and III interferons in both Syk-depleted cells and mice. Mechanistically, Syk interacted with TBK1 and modulated its phosphorylation status, thereby impeding TBK1 activation and restraining innate immune signaling that governs interferon response. Together, these findings unveil a role of Syk in temporally regulating host antiviral immunity and advance our understanding of complicated mechanisms underlying regulation of innate immunity against viral invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate immunity must be tightly controlled to eliminate invading pathogens while avoiding autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. Syk is essential for STAT1 activation at the early stage of IAV infection, which is critical for initial antiviral responses. Surprisingly, here a time course study showed that Syk suppressed innate immunity during late phases of IAV infection and thereby promoted IAV replication. Syk deficiency enhanced the expression of type I and III interferons, inhibited IAV replication, and rendered mice more resistant to IAV infection. Syk impaired innate immune signaling through impeding TBK1 activation. These data reveal that Syk participates in the initiation of antiviral defense against IAV infection and simultaneously contributes to the restriction of innate immunity at the late stage of viral infection, suggesting that Syk serves a dual function in regulating antiviral responses. This finding provides new insights into complicated mechanisms underlying interaction between virus and host immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aberrant Cellular Glycosylation May Increase the Ability of Influenza Viruses to Escape Host Immune Responses through Modification of the Viral Glycome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35285699/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals with metabolic dysregulation of cellular glycosylation often experience severe influenza disease, with a poor immune response to the virus and low vaccine efficacy. Here, we investigate the consequences of aberrant cellular glycosylation for the glycome and the biology of influenza virus. We transiently induced aberrant N-linked glycosylation in cultured cells with an oligosaccharyltransferase inhibitor, NGI-1. Cells treated with NGI-1 produced morphologically unaltered viable influenza virus with sequence-neutral glycosylation changes (primarily reduced site occupancy) in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. Hemagglutinin with reduced glycan occupancy required a higher concentration of surfactant protein D (an important innate immunity respiratory tract collectin) for inhibition compared to that with normal glycan occupancy. Immunization of mice with NGI-1-treated virus significantly reduced antihemagglutinin and antineuraminidase titers of total serum antibody and reduced hemagglutinin protective antibody responses. Our data suggest that aberrant cellular glycosylation may increase the risk of severe influenza as a result of the increased ability of glycome-modified influenza viruses to evade the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with disorders such as cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes, or obesity often have metabolic dysregulation of cellular glycosylation and also have more severe influenza disease, a reduced immune response to the virus, and reduced vaccine efficacy. Since influenza viruses that infect such people do not show consistent genomic variations, it is generally assumed that the altered biology is mainly related to host factors. However, since host cells are responsible for glycosylation of influenza virus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, and glycosylation is important for interactions of these proteins with the immune system, the viruses may have functional differences that are not reflected by their genomic sequence. Here, we show that imbalanced cellular glycosylation can modify the viral glycome without genomic changes, leading to reduced innate and adaptive host immune responses to infection. Our findings link metabolic dysregulation of host glycosylation to increased risk of severe influenza and reduced influenza virus vaccine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histones released by NETosis enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 by bridging the spike protein subunit 2 and sialic acid on host cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35273357/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) can capture and kill viruses, such as influenza viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), thus contributing to host defense. Contrary to our expectation, we show here that the histones released by NETosis enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, as found by using live SARS-CoV-2 and two pseudovirus systems as well as a mouse model. The histone H3 or H4 selectively binds to subunit 2 of the spike (S) protein, as shown by a biochemical binding assay, surface plasmon resonance and binding energy calculation as well as the construction of a mutant S protein by replacing four acidic amino acids. Sialic acid on the host cell surface is the key molecule to which histones bridge subunit 2 of the S protein. Moreover, histones enhance cell-cell fusion. Finally, treatment with an inhibitor of NETosis, histone H3 or H4, or sialic acid notably affected the levels of sgRNA copies and the number of apoptotic cells in a mouse model. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could hijack histones from neutrophil NETosis to promote its host cell attachment and entry process and may be important in exploring pathogenesis and possible strategies to develop new effective therapies for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TRAF6 autophagic degradation by avibirnavirus VP3 inhibits antiviral innate immunity via blocking NFKB/NF-κB activation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitination is an important reversible post-translational modification. Many viruses hijack the host ubiquitin system to enhance self-replication. In the present study, we found that Avibirnavirus VP3 protein was ubiquitinated during infection and supported virus replication by ubiquitination. Mass spectrometry and mutation analysis showed that VP3 was ubiquitinated at residues K73, K135, K158, K193, and K219. Virus rescue showed that ubiquitination at sites K73, K193, and K219 on VP3 could enhance the replication abilities of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), and that K135 was essential for virus survival. Binding of the zinc finger domain of TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor 6) to VP3 mediated K11- and K33-linked ubiquitination of VP3, which promoted its nuclear accumulation to facilitate virus replication. Additionally, VP3 could inhibit TRAF6-mediated NFKB/NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) activation and IFNB/IFN-β (interferon beta) production to evade host innate immunity by inducing TRAF6 autophagic degradation in an SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1)-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrated a macroautophagic/autophagic mechanism by which Avibirnavirus protein VP3 blocked NFKB-mediated IFNB production by targeting TRAF6 during virus infection, and provided a potential drug target for virus infection control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reovirus infection is regulated by NPC1 and endosomal cholesterol homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35263388/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol homeostasis is required for the replication of many viruses, including Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-1. Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is an endosomal-lysosomal membrane protein involved in cholesterol trafficking from late endosomes and lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum. We identified NPC1 in CRISPR and RNA interference screens as a putative host factor for infection by mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus). Following internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the reovirus outer capsid is proteolytically removed, the endosomal membrane is disrupted, and the viral core is released into the cytoplasm where viral transcription, genome replication, and assembly take place. We found that reovirus infection is significantly impaired in cells lacking NPC1, but infection is restored by treatment of cells with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, which binds and solubilizes cholesterol. Absence of NPC1 did not dampen infection by infectious subvirion particles, which are reovirus disassembly intermediates that bypass the endocytic pathway for infection of target cells. NPC1 is not required for reovirus attachment to the plasma membrane, internalization into cells, or uncoating within endosomes. Instead, NPC1 is required for delivery of transcriptionally active reovirus core particles from endosomes into the cytoplasm. These findings suggest that cholesterol homeostasis, ensured by NPC1 transport activity, is required for reovirus penetration into the cytoplasm, pointing to a new function for NPC1 and cholesterol homeostasis in viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type I interferons (IFN-I) are essential to establish antiviral innate immunity. Unanchored (or free) polyubiquitin (poly-Ub) has been shown to regulate IFN-I responses. However, few unanchored poly-Ub interactors are known. To identify factors regulated by unanchored poly-Ub in a physiological setting, we developed an approach to isolate unanchored poly-Ub from lung tissue. We identified the RNA helicase DHX16 as a potential pattern recognition receptor (PRR). Silencing of DHX16 in cells and in vivo diminished IFN-I responses against influenza virus. These effects extended to members of other virus families, including Zika and SARS-CoV-2. DHX16-dependent IFN-I production requires RIG-I and unanchored K48-poly-Ub synthesized by the E3-Ub ligase TRIM6. DHX16 recognizes a signal in influenza RNA segments that undergo splicing and requires its RNA helicase motif for direct, high-affinity interactions with specific viral RNAs. Our study establishes DHX16 as a PRR that partners with RIG-I for optimal activation of antiviral immunity requiring unanchored poly-Ub.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Whole-genome sequencing reveals host factors underlying critical COVID-19</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical COVID-19 is caused by immune-mediated inflammatory lung injury. Host genetic variation influences the development of illness requiring critical care1 or hospitalization2-4 after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The GenOMICC (Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care) study enables the comparison of genomes from individuals who are critically ill with those of population controls to find underlying disease mechanisms. Here we use whole-genome sequencing in 7,491 critically ill individuals compared with 48,400 controls to discover and replicate 23 independent variants that significantly predispose to critical COVID-19. We identify 16 new independent associations, including variants within genes that are involved in interferon signalling (IL10RB and PLSCR1), leucocyte differentiation (BCL11A) and blood-type antigen secretor status (FUT2). Using transcriptome-wide association and colocalization to infer the effect of gene expression on disease severity, we find evidence that implicates multiple genes-including reduced expression of a membrane flippase (ATP11A), and increased expression of a mucin (MUC1)-in critical disease. Mendelian randomization provides evidence in support of causal roles for myeloid cell adhesion molecules (SELE, ICAM5 and CD209) and the coagulation factor F8, all of which are potentially druggable targets. Our results are broadly consistent with a multi-component model of COVID-19 pathophysiology, in which at least two distinct mechanisms can predispose to life-threatening disease: failure to control viral replication; or an enhanced tendency towards pulmonary inflammation and intravascular coagulation. We show that comparison between cases of critical illness and population controls is highly efficient for the detection of therapeutically relevant mechanisms of disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Osteopontin aggravates acute lung injury in influenza virus infection by promoting macrophages necroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35246529/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) can trigger pulmonary inflammation and lung damage. Osteopontin (OPN) is an essential regulator of cell death and immunity. However, the role and underlying mechanism of OPN in cell death in IAV-induced pulmonary injury remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that OPN-deficient (OPN-/-) mice were insensitive to IAV, exhibiting decreased viral loads and attenuated lung injury after IAV infection compared to those in wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, macrophage necroptosis was significantly reduced in OPN-/- mice infected with IAV compared to that in infected WT mice. OPN increased the expression of necroptosis-related genes and exacerbated macrophage necroptosis in IAV-infected THP1 cells. Notably, adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or OPN-/- BMDMs into mice restored resistance to influenza infection, and the rescue effect of OPN-/- BMDMs was better than that of WT BMDMs. Collectively, these results suggest that OPN deficiency in macrophages reduces necroptosis, which leads to a decrease in viral titers and protects against IAV infection. Therefore, OPN is a potential target for the treatment of IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The inhibition effects and mechanisms of sulfated chitooligosaccharides on influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35337521/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfated chitooligosaccharide was reported to possess inhibition effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry into host cells. Herein, we prepared chitooligosaccharide COS and its sulfate derivative SCOS and explored whether the sulfation modification can enhance the anti-influenza A virus (IAV) activity of COS. Interestingly, we discovered that SCOS possessed broad-spectrum anti-IAV effects with low toxicity, while the non-sulfated chitooligosaccharide COS had very low inhibition on IAV, verifying that the sulfation modification is essential for the anti-IAV actions of chitooligosaccharide. SCOS may target virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein to block both virus adsorption and membrane fusion processes. Oral administration of SCOS significantly decreased pulmonary viral titers and improved survival rate in IAV infected mice, comparable to the effects of Oseltamivir. Therefore, our findings support further studies on the use of SCOS as a novel entry inhibitor for IAV and as a supplement to current therapeutics for influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Systematic optimization of host-directed therapeutic targets and preclinical validation of repositioned antiviral drugs</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35238349/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inhibition of host protein functions using established drugs produces a promising antiviral effect with excellent safety profiles, decreased incidence of resistant variants and favorable balance of costs and risks. Genomic methods have produced a large number of robust host factors, providing candidates for identification of antiviral drug targets. However, there is a lack of global perspectives and systematic prioritization of known virus-targeted host proteins (VTHPs) and drug targets. There is also a need for host-directed repositioned antivirals. Here, we integrated 6140 VTHPs and grouped viral infection modes from a new perspective of enriched pathways of VTHPs. Clarifying the superiority of nonessential membrane and hub VTHPs as potential ideal targets for repositioned antivirals, we proposed 543 candidate VTHPs. We then presented a large-scale drug-virus network (DVN) based on matching these VTHPs and drug targets. We predicted possible indications for 703 approved drugs against 35 viruses and explored their potential as broad-spectrum antivirals. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; tests validated the efficacy of bosutinib, maraviroc and dextromethorphan against human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and influenza A virus (IAV). Their drug synergy with clinically used antivirals was evaluated and confirmed. The results proved that low-dose dextromethorphan is better than high-dose in both single and combined treatments. This study provides a comprehensive landscape and optimization strategy for druggable VTHPs, constructing an innovative and potent pipeline to discover novel antiviral host proteins and repositioned drugs, which may facilitate their delivery to clinical application in translational medicine to combat fatal and spreading viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are primary contributors to pathologic IFN-γ response during IAV infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-γ regulates the pathologic phenotype of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes during IAV infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-γ deficiency mitigates IAV-mediated lung injury and improves barrier integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-γ is dispensable to IAV clearance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infection triggers an exuberant host response that promotes acute lung injury. However, the host response factors that promote the development of a pathologic inflammatory response to IAV remain incompletely understood. In this study, we identify an interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-regulated subset of monocytes, CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes, as a driver of lung damage during IAV infection. IFN-γ regulates the recruitment and inflammatory phenotype of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes, and mice deficient in CCR2 (CCR2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) or IFN-γ (IFN-γ&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) exhibit reduced lung inflammation, pathology, and disease severity. Adoptive transfer of wild-type (WT) (IFN-γR1&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;) but not IFN-γR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes restore the WT-like pathological phenotype of lung damage in IAV-infected CCR2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are the main source of IFN-γ in IAV-infected lungs. Collectively, our data highlight the requirement of IFN-γ signaling in the regulation of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocyte-mediated lung pathology during IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VPS29 Exerts Opposing Effects on Endocytic Viral Entry</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging zoonotic viral pathogens threaten global health, and there is an urgent need to discover host and viral determinants influencing infection. We performed a loss-of-function genome-wide CRISPR screen in a human lung cell line using HCoV-OC43, a human betacoronavirus. One candidate gene, VPS29, a component of the retromer complex, was required for infection by HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV-2, other endemic- and pandemic-threat coronaviruses, as well as ebolavirus. Notably, we observed a heightened requirement for VPS29 by the recently described Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the ancestral variant. However, VPS29 deficiency had no effect on certain other viruses that enter cells via endosomes and had an opposing, enhancing effect on influenza A virus infection. Deficiency in VPS29 or other retromer components caused changes in endosome morphology and acidity and attenuated the activity of endosomal proteases. These changes in endosome properties caused incoming coronavirus, but not influenza virus particles, to become entrapped therein. Overall, these data show how host regulation of endosome characteristics can influence cellular susceptibility to viral infection and identify a host pathway that could serve as a pharmaceutical target for intervention in zoonotic viral diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data identify a host pathway by which VPS29 and associated factors control the endosomal environment in a manner that influences susceptibility to viral infection. This pathway could serve as a pharmaceutical target for intervention in zoonotic viral diseases, including those caused by coronaviruses, influenza viruses, and filoviruses, all of which are pandemic threats. Our findings show how host regulation of endosome characteristics can influence viral susceptibility in both a positive and negative manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a public health emergency of international concerns. Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is a critical clinical symptom of severe COVID-19 patients, and the macrophage is recognized as the direct host cell of SARS-CoV-2 and potential drivers of CSS. In the present study, peramivir was identified to reduce TNF-α by partly intervention of NF-κB activity in LPS-induced macrophage model. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, peramivir reduced the multi-cytokines in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), alleviated the acute lung injury and prolonged the survival time in mice. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs), peramivir could also inhibit the release of TNF-α. Collectively, we proposed that peramivir might be a candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 and other infections related CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Host cytoskeletal vimentin serves as a structural organizer and an RNA-binding protein regulator to facilitate Zika viral replication</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35193960/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35193960/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered a dual role of vimentin underlying Zika virus (ZIKV) replication. The vimentin network reorganizes to surround the replication complex. Depletion of vimentin resulted in drastic segregation of viral proteins and subsequent defective infection, indicating its function as an “organizer” that ensures the concentration of all necessary factors for high replication efficacy. With omics analysis, we prove that vimentin also functions as a “regulator” that dominates RNA-binding proteins during infection. These two roles complement one another to make an integrated view of vimentin in regulating ZIKV infection. Collectively, our study fills the long-term gap in our knowledge of the cellular function of intermediate filaments in addition to structural support and provides a potential target for ZIKV therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging microbe infections, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), pose an increasing threat to human health. Investigations on ZIKV replication have revealed the construction of replication complexes (RCs), but the role of cytoskeleton in this process is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the function of cytoskeletal intermediate filament protein vimentin in the life cycle of ZIKV infection. Using advanced imaging techniques, we uncovered that vimentin filaments undergo drastic reorganization upon viral protein synthesis to form a perinuclear cage-like structure that embraces and concentrates RCs. Genetic removal of vimentin markedly disrupted the integrity of RCs and resulted in fragmented subcellular dispersion of viral proteins. This led to reduced viral genome replication, viral protein production, and release of infectious virions, without interrupting viral binding and entry. Furthermore, mass spectrometry and RNA-sequencing screens identified interactions and interplay between vimentin and hundreds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident RNA-binding proteins. Among them, the cytoplasmic-region of ribosome receptor binding protein 1, an ER transmembrane protein that directly binds viral RNA, interacted with and was regulated by vimentin, resulting in modulation of ZIKV replication. Together, the data in our work reveal a dual role for vimentin as a structural element for RC integrity and as an RNA-binding-regulating hub during ZIKV infection, thus unveiling a layer of interplay between Zika virus and host cell.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prompt Antiviral Action of Pulmonary CD8&#43; TRM Cells Is Mediated by Rapid IFN-γ Induction and Its Downstream ISGs in the Lung</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35296070/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing lines of evidence supported the importance of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; lung tissue resident memory T (T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;) cells in protection against respiratory viruses, exemplified by influenza A virus. However, the underlying &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; mechanism remains largely undetermined. Here, we used mouse infection models to dissect &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; cross-protective activity of lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells. By simultaneously interrogating transcriptional dynamics in lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells and surrounding tissues during the early course of infection, we demonstrated that lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells react to antigen re-exposure within hours, manifested by IFN-γ upregulation, and a tissue-wide interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) program is subsequently elicited. Using antibody-mediated IFN-γ neutralization and IFN-γ receptor knockout mice, we could show that the induction of several important antiviral ISGs required IFN-γ signaling, so did the suppression of key inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, there were also examples of ISGs unaffected in the absence of IFN-γ activity. Collectively, focusing on &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; characterization of lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells during very early stage of infection, a critical period of host antiviral defense that has been poorly investigated, our studies highlight that these cells, once triggered by antigen re-exposure, are programmed to produce IFN-γ expeditiously to promote a lung-wide antiviral response for effective virus control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infection with dengue virus (DENV) induces vast rearrangements of the endoplasmic reticulum, which allows the compartmentalization of viral RNA replication and particle assembly. Both processes occur in concert with viral and cellular proteins. Prior studies from our group suggest that the host RNA-binding protein (RBP) Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) is required for a late step in the DENV replication cycle. Here we report that YBX1 interacts with the viral nucleocapsid, distributes to DENV assembly sites and is required for efficient assembly of intracellular infectious virions and their secretion. Genetic ablation of YBX1 decreased the spatial proximity between capsid and envelope, increased the susceptibility of envelope to proteinase K mediated degradation, resulted in the formation of rough empty-looking particles, and decreased the secretion of viral particles. We propose a model wherein YBX1 enables the interaction between the viral nucleocapsid with the structural protein E, which is required for proper assembly of intracellular virus particles and their secretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global incidence of dengue virus (DENV) infections has steadily increased over the past decades representing an enormous challenge for public health. During infection, DENV viral RNA interacts with numerous host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that aid viral replication and thus constitute potential molecular targets to curb infection. We recently reported that Y-box-binding protein 1 (YBX1) interacts with DENV RNA and is required at a late step of the replication cycle. Here we describe the molecular mechanism by which YBX1 mediates DENV infection. We show that YBX1 interacts with the viral nucleocapsid, distributes to DENV assembly sites and is required for efficient assembly of intracellular infectious virions. These results provide important insights into DENV assembly, revealing novel functions of host RBPs during viral infection and opening new avenues for antiviral intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BCG vaccination provides protection against IAV but not SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35235831/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BCG vaccination provides significant protection against IAV in mice and hamsters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BCG provides no protection against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and hamsters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 induces pulmonary hemorrhage and disseminates to the bone marrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monocytes from BCG-vaccinated humans induce more cytokines to IAV than SARS-CoV-2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the vast majority of species solely rely on innate immunity for host defense, it stands to reason that a critical evolutionary trait like immunological memory evolved in this primitive branch of our immune system. There is ample evidence that vaccines such as bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induce protective innate immune memory responses (trained immunity) against heterologous pathogens. Here we show that while BCG vaccination significantly reduces morbidity and mortality against influenza A virus (IAV), it fails to provide protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In contrast to IAV, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to unique pulmonary vasculature damage facilitating viral dissemination to other organs, including the bone marrow (BM), a central site for BCG-mediated trained immunity. Finally, monocytes from BCG-vaccinated individuals mount an efficient cytokine response to IAV infection, while this response is minimal following SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our data suggest that the protective capacity of BCG vaccination is contingent on viral pathogenesis and tissue tropism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poxviruses and paramyxoviruses use a conserved mechanism of STAT1 antagonism to inhibit interferon signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35182467/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poxvirus protein 018 is a virulence factor that inhibits IFN-induced signaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;018 binds the STAT1 SH2 domain to block its recruitment to the IFNγ receptor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The structure of the 018:STAT1 complex reveals a pTyr-independent binding mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccinia and Nipah viruses acquired a STAT1-binding motif by convergent evolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The induction of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes by STATs is a critical host defense mechanism against virus infection. Here, we report that a highly expressed poxvirus protein, 018, inhibits IFN-induced signaling by binding to the SH2 domain of STAT1, thereby preventing the association of STAT1 with an activated IFN receptor. Despite encoding other inhibitors of IFN-induced signaling, a poxvirus mutant lacking 018 was attenuated in mice. The 2.0 Å crystal structure of the 018:STAT1 complex reveals a phosphotyrosine-independent mode of 018 binding to the SH2 domain of STAT1. Moreover, the STAT1-binding motif of 018 shows similarity to the STAT1-binding proteins from Nipah virus, which, similar to 018, block the association of STAT1 with an IFN receptor. Overall, these results uncover a conserved mechanism of STAT1 antagonism that is employed independently by distinct virus families.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TMEM106A inhibits enveloped virus release from cell surface</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type II transmembrane protein TMEM106A can be incorporated into virion particles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TMEM106A inhibits enveloped virion release through C-terminal molecular interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HIV-1 envelope protein interacts with TMEM106A and suppresses its antiviral activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TMEM106A is an evolutionarily conserved antiviral factor against multiple viruses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enveloped viruses pose constant threat to hosts from ocean to land. Virion particle release from cell surface is a critical step in the viral life cycle for most enveloped viruses, making it a common antiviral target for the host defense system. Here we report that host factor TMEM106A inhibits the release of enveloped viruses from the cell surface. TMEM106A is a type II transmembrane protein localized on the plasma membrane and can be incorporated into HIV-1 virion particles. Through intermolecular interactions of its C-terminal domains on virion particle and plasma membrane, TMEM106A traps virion particles to the cell surface. HIV-1 Env interacts with TMEM106A to interfere with the intermolecular interactions and partially suppresses its antiviral activity. TMEM106A orthologs from various species displayed potent antiviral activity against multiple enveloped viruses. These results suggest that TMEM106A is an evolutionarily conserved antiviral factor that inhibits the release of enveloped viruses from the cell surface.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GMR sensors are used for the first time to monitor the host response to influenza.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GMR assay can perform multiplexed quantification of ten influenza-activated genes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GMR assay can diagnose influenza-infected individuals with high accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detecting and quantifying the host transcriptional response to influenza virus infection can serve as a real-time diagnostic tool for clinical management. We have employed the multiplexing capabilities of GMR sensors to develop a novel assay based on the influenza metasignature (IMS), which can classify influenza infection based on transcript levels. We show that the assay can reliably detect ten IMS transcripts and distinguish subjects with naturally acquired influenza infection from those with other symptomatic viral infections (AUC 0.93, 95% CI: 0.82-1.00). Separately, we validated that the gene IFI27, not included in the IMS panel, has very high single-biomarker accuracy (AUC 0.95, 95% CI: 0.90-0.99) in stratifying patients with influenza. We demonstrate that a portable GMR biosensor can be used as a tool to diagnose influenza infection by measuring the host response, simultaneously highlighting the power of immune system metrics and advancing the field of gene expression-based diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Korean Red Ginseng, a regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome, in the COVID-19 pandemic</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits various symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia or death. The major features of patients in severe COVID-19 are the dysregulation of cytokine secretion, pneumonia, and acute lung injury. Consequently, it leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multiple organ failure, and death. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of COVID-19, influences nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), the sensor of inflammasomes, directly or indirectly, culminating in the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome and activation of inflammatory caspases, which induce the inflammatory disruption in severe COVID-19. Accordingly, the target therapeutics for inflammasome has attracted attention as a treatment for COVID-19. Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) inhibits several inflammatory responses, including the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. This review discusses the role of KRG in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 based on its anti-NLRP3 inflammasome efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A viruses (IAVs) continuously challenge the poultry industry and human health. Elucidation of the host factors that modulate the IAV lifecycle is vital for developing antiviral drugs and vaccines. In this study, we infected A549 cells with IAVs and found that host protein contactin-1 (CNTN1), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, enhanced viral replication. Bioinformatic prediction and experimental validation indicated that the expression of CNTN1 was reduced by microRNA-200c (miR-200c) through directly targeting. We further showed that CNTN1-modulated viral replication in A549 cells is dependent on type I interferon signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CNTN1 specifically interacts with MAVS and promotes its proteasomal degradation by removing its K63-linked ubiquitination. Moreover, we discovered that the deubiquitinase USP25 is recruited by CNTN1 to catalyze the deubiquitination of K63-linked MAVS. Consequently, the CNTN1-induced degradation cascade of MAVS blocked RIG-I-MAVS-mediated interferon signaling, leading to enhanced viral replication. Taken together, our data reveal novel roles of CNTN1 in the type I interferon pathway and regulatory mechanism of IAV replication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-borne pathogen for which humans are an incidental host. POWV infection can be fatal or result in long-term neurological sequelae; however, there are no approved vaccinations for POWV. Integral to efficacious vaccine development is the identification of correlates of protection, which we accomplished in this study by utilizing a murine model of POWV infection. Using POWV lethal and sub-lethal challenge models, we show that (1) robust B and T cell responses are necessary for immune protection, (2) POWV lethality can be attributed to both viral- and host-mediated drivers of disease, and (3) knowledge of the immune correlates of protection against POWV can be applied in a virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccination approach that provides protection from lethal POWV challenge. Identification of these immune protection factors is significant as it will aid in the rational design of POWV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of Protein N- Glycosylation Blocks SARS-CoV-2 Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35164559/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) extensively N-glycosylates its spike proteins, which are necessary for host cell invasion and the target of both vaccines and immunotherapies. These N-glycans are predicted to modulate spike binding to the host receptor by stabilizing its open conformation and host immunity evasion. Here, we investigated the essentiality of both the host N-glycosylation pathway and SARS-CoV-2 N-glycans for infection. Ablation of host N-glycosylation using RNA interference or inhibitors, including FDA-approved drugs, reduced the spread of the infection, including that of variants B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). Under these conditions, cells produced fewer virions and some completely lost their infectivity. Furthermore, partial enzymatic deglycosylation of intact virions showed that surface-exposed N-glycans are critical for cell invasion. Altogether, we propose protein N-glycosylation as a targetable pathway with clinical potential for treatment of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike surface proteins to infect human cells. Spike proteins are heavily modified with several N-glycans, which are predicted to modulate their function. In this work, we show that interfering with either the synthesis or attachment of spike N-glycans significantly reduces the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, including that of several variants. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants, with various degrees of resistance against current vaccines, are likely to continue appearing, halting virus glycosylation using repurposed human drugs could result in a complementary strategy to reducing the spread of COVID-19 worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TBK1 directly phosphorylates METTL3 at serine 67 upon VSV infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TBK1 promotes catalytic activity of METTL3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S67 phosphorylation enhances METTL3 function in promoting translation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mRNA m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification is heavily involved in modulation of immune responses. However, its function in antiviral immunity is controversial, and how immune responses regulate m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification remains elusive. We here find TBK1, a key kinase of antiviral pathways, phosphorylates the core m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methyltransferase METTL3 at serine 67. The phosphorylated METTL3 interacts with the translational complex, which is required for enhancing protein translation, thus facilitating antiviral responses. TBK1 also promotes METTL3 activation and m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification to stabilize IRF3 mRNA. Type I interferon (IFN) induction is severely impaired in METTL3-deficient cells. &lt;em&gt;Mettl3&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;-lyz2-Cre mice are more susceptible to influenza A virus (IAV)-induced lethality than control mice. Consistently, &lt;em&gt;Ythdf1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice show higher mortality than wild-type mice due to decreased IRF3 expression and subsequently attenuated IFN production. Together, we demonstrate that innate signals activate METTL3 via TBK1, and METTL3-mediated m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification secures antiviral immunity by promoting mRNA stability and protein translation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation of functional immune cell plasticity is poorly understood. Host environmental cues are critical, but the possible influence of pathogen-derived virulence factors has not been described. We have used reverse-engineered influenza A viruses that differ in PB1-F2 activity to analyze influenza in mice in the presence or absence of host interferon (IFN)-γ. In the absence of functional PB1-F2 and IFN-γ, lung ILC2s initiated robust IL-5 responses following viral challenge, which led to improved tissue integrity and survival. Conversely, functional PB1-F2 suppressed IL-5&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ILC2 responses and induced a dominant IL-13&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8 T cell response regardless of host IFN-γ. These findings demonstrate the critical interplay between the viral virulence factors and host cytokines in regulating protective pulmonary immunity during influenza virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional plasticity of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and T cells is regulated by host environmental cues, but the influence of pathogen-derived virulence factors has not been described. We now report the interplay between host interferon (IFN)-γ and viral PB1-F2 virulence protein in regulating the functions of ILC2s and T cells that lead to recovery from influenza virus infection of mice. In the absence of IFN-γ, lung ILC2s from mice challenged with the A/California/04/2009 (CA04) H1N1 virus, containing nonfunctional viral PB1-F2, initiated a robust IL-5 response, which also led to improved tissue integrity and increased survival. Conversely, challenge with Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) H1N1 virus expressing fully functional PB1-F2, suppressed IL-5&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ILC2 responses, and induced a dominant IL-13&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8 T cell response, regardless of host IFN-γ expression. IFN-γ–deficient mice had increased survival and improved tissue integrity following challenge with lethal doses of CA04, but not PR8 virus, and increased resistance was dependent on the presence of IFN-γR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ILC2s. Reverse-engineered influenza viruses differing in functional PB1-F2 activity induced ILC2 and T cell phenotypes similar to the PB1-F2 donor strains, demonstrating the potent role of viral PB1-F2 in host resistance. These results show the ability of a pathogen virulence factor together with host IFN-γ to regulate protective pulmonary immunity during influenza infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular Prerequisites for Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation and Evasion Mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35237275/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NETosis is a multi-facetted cellular process that promotes the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs as web-like structures consist of DNA fibers armed with granular proteins, histones, and microbicidal peptides, thereby exhibiting pathogen-immobilizing and antimicrobial attributes that maximize innate immune defenses against invading microbes. However, clinically relevant pathogens often tolerate entrapment and even take advantage of the remnants of NETs to cause persistent infections in mammalian hosts. Here, we briefly summarize how &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;, a high-priority pathogen and causative agent of fatal diseases in humans as well as animals, catalyzes and concurrently exploits NETs during pathogenesis and recurrent infections. Specifically, we focus on toxigenic and immunomodulatory effector molecules produced by staphylococci that prime NET formation, and further highlight the molecular and underlying principles of suicidal NETosis compared to vital NET-formation by viable neutrophils in response to these stimuli. We also discuss the inflammatory potential of NET-controlled microenvironments, as excessive expulsion of NETs from activated neutrophils provokes local tissue injury and may therefore amplify staphylococcal disease severity in hospitalized or chronically ill patients. Combined with an overview of adaptation and counteracting strategies evolved by S. aureus to impede NET-mediated killing, these insights may stimulate biomedical research activities to uncover novel aspects of NET biology at the host-microbe interface.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An adjuvant strategy enabled by modulation of the physical properties of microbial ligands expands antigen immunogenicity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35148840/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size and solubility of microbial ligands determine the immune response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fungal mannans are directly drained to the LN to drive cell accrual via interferon release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuning mannan physical properties broadens epitope specificity of SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike antibodies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An adjuvant formulation of mannan/alum induces heterosubtypic immunity against IAV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activation of the innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is key to generate lasting adaptive immunity. PRRs detect unique chemical patterns associated with invading microorganisms, but whether and how the physical properties of PRR ligands influence the development of the immune response remains unknown. Through the study of fungal mannans, we show that the physical form of PRR ligands dictates the immune response. Soluble mannans are immunosilent in the periphery but elicit a potent pro-inflammatory response in the draining lymph node (dLN). By modulating the physical form of mannans, we developed a formulation that targets both the periphery and the dLN. When combined with viral glycoprotein antigens, this mannan formulation broadens epitope recognition, elicits potent antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies, and confers protection against viral infections of the lung. Thus, the physical properties of microbial ligands determine the outcome of the immune response and can be harnessed for vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatial, temporal and molecular dynamics of swine influenza virus-specific CD8 tissue resident memory T cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time we have defined naïve, central memory, effector memory and differentiated effector porcine CD8 T cells and analyzed their distribution in lymphoid and respiratory tissues after influenza infection or immunization, using peptide-MHC tetramers of three influenza nucleoprotein (NP) epitopes. The hierarchy of response to the three epitopes changes during the response in different tissues. Most NP-specific CD8 T cells in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and lung are tissue resident memory cells (TRM) that express CD69 and downregulate CD45RA and CCR7. NP-specific cells isolated from BAL express genes characteristic of TRM, but gene expression differs at 7, 21 and 63 days post infection. In all tissues the frequency of NP-specific CD8 cells declines over 63 days almost to background levels but is best maintained in BAL. The kinetic of influenza specific memory CD8 T cell in this natural host species differs from that in small animal models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization associates with impaired adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BackgroundAlthough recent epidemiological data suggest that pneumococci may contribute to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 disease, cases of coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during hospitalization have been reported infrequently. This apparent contradiction may be explained by interactions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and pneumococci in the upper airway, resulting in the escape of SARS-CoV-2 from protective host immune responses.MethodsHere, we investigated the relationship of these 2 respiratory pathogens in 2 distinct cohorts of health care workers with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection identified by systematic screening and patients with moderate to severe disease who presented to the hospital. We assessed the effect of coinfection on host antibody, cellular, and inflammatory responses to the virus.ResultsIn both cohorts, pneumococcal colonization was associated with diminished antiviral immune responses, which primarily affected mucosal IgA levels among individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection and cellular memory responses in infected patients.ConclusionOur findings suggest that S. pneumoniae impair host immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and raise the question of whether pneumococcal carriage also enables immune escape of other respiratory viruses and facilitates reinfection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disulfiram inhibits neutrophil extracellular trap formation and protects rodents from acute lung injury and SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35133984/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute lung injury has few treatment options and a high mortality rate. Upon injury, neutrophils infiltrate the lungs and form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), damaging the lungs and driving an exacerbated immune response. Unfortunately, no drug preventing NET formation has completed clinical development. Here, we report that disulfiram - an FDA-approved drug for alcohol use disorder - dramatically reduced NETs, increased survival, improved blood oxygenation, and reduced lung edema in a transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) mouse model. We then tested whether disulfiram could confer protection in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as NETs are elevated in patients with severe COVID-19. In SARS-CoV-2-infected golden hamsters, disulfiram reduced NETs and perivascular fibrosis in the lungs, and it downregulated innate immune and complement/coagulation pathways, suggesting that it could be beneficial for patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, an existing FDA-approved drug can block NET formation and improve disease course in 2 rodent models of lung injury for which treatment options are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Differential interferon-α subtype induced immune signatures are associated with suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferons (IFN-I) exhibit various biological effects during viral infections, and they have been successfully used for clinical treatment of viral diseases. Humans express 12 IFNα subtypes, which strongly differ in their antiviral responses against different viruses. Here we analyzed the antiviral activity of all human IFNα subtypes against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to identify the underlying immune signatures and explore their therapeutic potential. Our data provide a systemic pattern of antiviral host effector responses mediated by high antiviral IFN-I, which could help to identify key cellular effectors targeted in novel therapeutic approaches against SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferons (IFN-I) exert pleiotropic biological effects during viral infections, balancing virus control versus immune-mediated pathologies, and have been successfully employed for the treatment of viral diseases. Humans express 12 IFN-alpha (α) subtypes, which activate downstream signaling cascades and result in distinct patterns of immune responses and differential antiviral responses. Inborn errors in IFN-I immunity and the presence of anti-IFN autoantibodies account for very severe courses of COVID-19; therefore, early administration of IFN-I may be protective against life-threatening disease. Here we comprehensively analyzed the antiviral activity of all IFNα subtypes against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to identify the underlying immune signatures and explore their therapeutic potential. Prophylaxis of primary human airway epithelial cells (hAEC) with different IFNα subtypes during SARS-CoV-2 infection uncovered distinct functional classes with high, intermediate, and low antiviral IFNs. In particular, IFNα5 showed superior antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice in vivo. Dose dependency studies further displayed additive effects upon coadministration with the broad antiviral drug remdesivir in cell culture. Transcriptomic analysis of IFN-treated hAEC revealed different transcriptional signatures, uncovering distinct, intersecting, and prototypical genes of individual IFNα subtypes. Global proteomic analyses systematically assessed the abundance of specific antiviral key effector molecules which are involved in IFN-I signaling pathways, negative regulation of viral processes, and immune effector processes for the potent antiviral IFNα5. Taken together, our data provide a systemic, multimodular definition of antiviral host responses mediated by defined IFN-I. This knowledge will support the development of novel therapeutic approaches against SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) negatively regulate ebolavirus structural glycoprotein expression in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the autophagy-lysosomal pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35130104/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) causes a severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates with high morbidity and mortality. EBOV infection is dependent on its structural glycoprotein (GP), but high levels of GP expression also trigger cell rounding, detachment, and downregulation of many surface molecules that is thought to contribute to its high pathogenicity. Thus, EBOV has evolved an RNA editing mechanism to reduce its GP expression and increase its fitness. We now report that the GP expression is also suppressed at the protein level in cells by protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). Although PDIs promote oxidative protein folding by catalyzing correct disulfide formation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PDIA3/ERp57 adversely triggered the GP misfolding by targeting GP cysteine residues and activated the unfolded protein response (UPR). Abnormally folded GP was targeted by ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) machinery and, unexpectedly, was degraded via the macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosomal pathway, but not the proteasomal pathway. PDIA3 also decreased the GP expression from other ebolavirus species but increased the GP expression from Marburg virus (MARV), which is consistent with the observation that MARV-GP does not cause cell rounding and detachment, and MARV does not regulate its GP expression via RNA editing during infection. Furthermore, five other PDIs also had a similar inhibitory activity to EBOV-GP. Thus, PDIs negatively regulate ebolavirus glycoprotein expression, which balances the viral life cycle by maximizing their infection but minimizing their cellular effect. We suggest that ebolaviruses hijack the host protein folding and ERAD machinery to increase their fitness via reticulophagy during infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dihydroartemisinin attenuates pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in rats by suppressing JAK2/STAT3 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35120332/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has induced a worldwide pandemic since early 2020. COVID-19 causes pulmonary inflammation, secondary pulmonary fibrosis (PF); however, there are still no effective treatments for PF. The present study aimed to explore the inhibitory effect of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) on pulmonary inflammation and PF, and its molecular mechanism. Morphological changes and collagen deposition were analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson staining, and the hydroxyproline content. DHA attenuated early alveolar inflammation and later PF in a bleomycin-induced rat PF model, and inhibited the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 3 (CCL3) in model rat serum. Further molecular analysis revealed that both pulmonary inflammation and PF were associated with increased transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2), and signal transducer and activator 3(STAT3) expression in the lung tissues of model rats. DHA reduced the inflammatory response and PF in the lungs by suppressing TGF-β1, JAK2, phosphorylated (p)-JAK2, STAT3, and p-STAT3. Thus, DHA exerts therapeutic effects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and PF by inhibiting JAK2-STAT3 activation. DHA inhibits alveolar inflammation, and attenuates lung injury and fibrosis, possibly representing a therapeutic candidate to treat PF associated with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CBASS phage defense and evolution of antiviral nucleotide signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35123147/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling system (CBASS) immunity is a widespread form of antiphage defense in bacteria and archaea. Each CBASS operon encodes a cGAS/DncV-like Nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) enzyme that synthesizes a nucleotide second messenger in response to viral infection. An associated Cap effector protein then binds the nucleotide signal and executes cell death to destroy the host cell and block phage propagation. Here we build upon recent advances to establish rules controlling each step of CBASS activation and antiphage defense. Comparative analysis of CBASS, CRISPR, Pycsar, and cGAS-STING immunity provides insight into the evolution of phage defense and animal innate immunity and highlights new questions emerging in the role of nucleotide second messenger signaling in host-virus interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infects less than 1% of cells in the human body, yet it can cause severe damage in a variety of organs. Thus, deciphering the non-cell-autonomous effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection is imperative for understanding the cellular and molecular disruption it elicits. Neurological and cognitive defects are among the least understood symptoms of COVID-19 patients, with olfactory dysfunction being their most common sensory deficit. Here, we show that both in humans and hamsters, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) and of their signaling components. This non-cell-autonomous effect is preceded by a dramatic reorganization of the neuronal nuclear architecture, which results in dissipation of genomic compartments harboring OR genes. Our data provide a potential mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the cellular morphology and the transcriptome of cells it cannot infect, offering insight to its systemic effects in olfaction and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Lung Regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35107300/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lung is the primary site of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced immunopathology whereby the virus enters the host cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Sophisticated regeneration and repair programs exist in the lungs to replenish injured cell populations. However, known resident stem/progenitor cells have been demonstrated to express ACE2, raising a substantial concern regarding the long-term consequences of impaired lung regeneration after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, clinical treatments may also affect lung repair from antiviral drug candidates to mechanical ventilation. In this review, we highlight how SARS-CoV-2 disrupts a program that governs lung homeostasis. We also summarize the current efforts of targeted therapy and supportive treatments for COVID-19 patients. In addition, we discuss the pros and cons of cell therapy with mesenchymal stem cells or resident lung epithelial stem/progenitor cells in preventing post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. We propose that, in addition to symptomatic treatments being developed and applied in the clinic, targeting lung regeneration is also essential to restore lung homeostasis in COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasdermins, a family of five pore-forming proteins (GSDMA-GSDME) in humans expressed predominantly in the skin, mucosa and immune sentinel cells, are key executioners of inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis), which recruits immune cells to infection sites and promotes protective immunity. Pore formation is triggered by gasdermin cleavage. Although the proteases that activate GSDMB, C, D and E have been identified, how GSDMA-the dominant gasdermin in the skin-is activated, remains unknown. Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A Streptococcus (GAS), is a major skin pathogen that causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Here we show that the GAS cysteine protease SpeB virulence factor triggers keratinocyte pyroptosis by cleaving GSDMA after Gln246, unleashing an active N-terminal fragment that triggers pyroptosis. Gsdma1 genetic deficiency blunts mouse immune responses to GAS, resulting in uncontrolled bacterial dissemination and death. GSDMA acts as both a sensor and substrate of GAS SpeB and as an effector to trigger pyroptosis, adding a simple one-molecule mechanism for host recognition and control of virulence of a dangerous microbial pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vasculature-on-a-chip platform with innate immunity enables identification of angiopoietin-1 derived peptide as a therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35142777/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was primarily identified as a novel disease causing acute respiratory syndrome. However, as the pandemic progressed various cases of secondary organ infection and damage by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported, including a breakdown of the vascular barrier. As SARS-CoV-2 gains access to blood circulation through the lungs, the virus is first encountered by the layer of endothelial cells and immune cells that participate in host defense. Here, we developed an approach to study SARS-CoV-2 infection using vasculature-on-a-chip. We first modeled the interaction of virus alone with the endothelialized vasculature-on-a-chip, followed by the studies of the interaction of the virus exposed-endothelial cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In an endothelial model grown on a permeable microfluidic bioscaffold under flow conditions, both human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 presence diminished endothelial barrier function by disrupting VE-cadherin junctions and elevating the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and angiopoietin-2. Inflammatory cytokine markers were markedly more elevated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to HCoV-NL63 infection. Introduction of PBMCs with monocytes into the vasculature-on-a-chip upon SARS-CoV-2 infection further exacerbated cytokine-induced endothelial dysfunction, demonstrating the compounding effects of inter-cellular crosstalk between endothelial cells and monocytes in facilitating the hyperinflammatory state. Considering the harmful effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial cells, even without active virus proliferation inside the cells, a potential therapeutic approach is critical. We identified angiopoietin-1 derived peptide, QHREDGS, as a potential therapeutic capable of profoundly attenuating the inflammatory state of the cells consistent with the levels in non-infected controls, thereby improving the barrier function and endothelial cell survival against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of PBMC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Host glycocalyx captures HIV proximal to the cell surface via oligomannose-GlcNAc glycan-glycan interactions to support viral entry</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35108536/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viral glycan shield acts as a cellular attachment factor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viral oligomannose initiates host cell attachment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This initial attachment is a specific, non-electrostatic interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blocking this interaction may present a pan-specific suppression mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we present ultrastructural analyses showing that incoming HIV are captured near the lymphocyte surface in a virion-glycan-dependent manner. Biophysical analyses show that removal of either virion- or cell-associated N-glycans impairs virus-cell binding, and a similar glycan-dependent relationship is observed between purified HIV envelope (Env) and primary T cells. Trimming of N-glycans from either HIV or Env does not inhibit protein-protein interactions. Glycan arrays reveal HIV preferentially binds to N-acetylglucosamine and mannose. Interfering with these glycan-based interactions reduces HIV infectivity. These glycan interactions are distinct from previously reported glycan-lectin and non-specific electrostatic charge-based interactions. Specific glycan-glycan-mediated attachment occurs prior to virus entry and enhances efficiency of infection. Binding and fluorescent imaging data support glycan-glycan interactions as being responsible, at least in part, for initiating contact between HIV and the host cell, prior to viral Env-cellular CD4 engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human cytomegalovirus protein RL1 degrades the antiviral factor SLFN11 via recruitment of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35105802/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important human pathogen and a paradigm of viral immune evasion, targeting intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immunity. We have employed two orthogonal multiplexed tandem mass tag-based proteomic screens to identify host proteins down-regulated by viral factors expressed during the latest phases of viral infection. This approach revealed that the HIV-1 restriction factor Schlafen-11 (SLFN11) was degraded by the poorly characterized, late-expressed HCMV protein RL1, via recruitment of the Cullin4-RING E3 Ubiquitin Ligase (CRL4) complex. SLFN11 potently restricted HCMV infection, inhibiting the formation and spread of viral plaques. Overall, we show that a restriction factor previously thought only to inhibit RNA viruses additionally restricts HCMV. We define the mechanism of viral antagonism and also describe an important resource for revealing additional molecules of importance in antiviral innate immunity and viral immune evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>m6A modifications regulate intestinal immunity and rotavirus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35098923/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant mRNA modification and affects many biological processes. However, how m6A levels are regulated during physiological or pathological processes such as virus infections, and the in vivo function of m6A in the intestinal immune defense against virus infections are largely unknown. Here, we uncover a novel antiviral function of m6A modification during rotavirus (RV) infection in small bowel intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). We found that rotavirus infection induced global m6A modifications on mRNA transcripts by down-regulating the m6a eraser ALKBH5. Mice lacking the m6A writer enzymes METTL3 in IECs (&lt;em&gt;Mettl3&lt;/em&gt;ΔIEC) were resistant to RV infection and showed increased expression of interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Using RNA-sequencing and m6A RNA immuno-precipitation (RIP)-sequencing, we identified IRF7, a master regulator of IFN responses, as one of the primary m6A targets during virus infection. In the absence of METTL3, IECs showed increased &lt;em&gt;Irf7&lt;/em&gt; mRNA stability and enhanced type I and III IFN expression. Deficiency in IRF7 attenuated the elevated expression of IFNs and ISGs and restored susceptibility to RV infection in &lt;em&gt;Mettl3&lt;/em&gt;ΔIEC mice. Moreover, the global m6A modification on mRNA transcripts declined with age in mice, with a significant drop from 2 weeks to 3 weeks post birth, which likely has broad implications for the development of intestinal immune system against enteric viruses early in life. Collectively, we demonstrated a novel host m6A-IRF7-IFN antiviral signaling cascade that restricts rotavirus infection &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OTUD7B deubiquitinates SQSTM1/p62 and promotes IRF3 degradation to regulate antiviral immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35100065/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deubiquitination plays an important role in the regulation of the crosstalk between macroautophagy/autophagy and innate immune signaling, yet its regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we identify the deubiquitinase OTUD7B as a negative regulator of antiviral immunity by targeting IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) for selective autophagic degradation. Mechanistically, OTUD7B interacts with IRF3, and activates IRF3-associated cargo receptor SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) by removing its K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains at lysine 7 (K7) to enhance SQSTM1 oligomerization. Moreover, viral infection increased the expression of OTUD7B, which forms a negative feedback loop by promoting IRF3 degradation to balance type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Taken together, our study reveals a specific role of OTUD7B in mediating the activation of cargo receptors in a substrate-dependent manner, which could be a potential target against excessive immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A case of convergent evolution: Several viral and bacterial pathogens hijack RSK kinases through a common linear motif</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35091472/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35091472/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful microbial infections typically involve the subversion of host immune pathways by pathogen-specific virulence factors. Here, we uncovered that viruses and bacteria independently evolved effectors targeting the same conserved loop of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p90-ribosomal S6-kinases (RSKs). Kinase usurpation relies on a previously unidentified short linear motif (SLiM) shared by these virulence factors. Mechanistically, RSK kinase binding prevents its dephosphorylation, thus promoting its phosphorylating activity. Remarkably, while viruses and bacteria evolved an identical mechanism of kinase activation, downstream effect diverged, effectively disarming different arms of the immune system according to their own need. This is a prominent illustration of trans-kingdom convergent evolution across microbial pathogens to usurp key signaling kinases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microbes have been coevolving with their host for millions of years, exploiting host resources to their own benefit. We show that viral and bacterial pathogens convergently evolved to hijack cellular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p90-ribosomal S6-kinases (RSKs). Theiler’s virus leader (L) protein binds RSKs and prevents their dephosphorylation, thus maintaining the kinases active. Recruitment of RSKs enables L-protein-mediated inhibition of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 2 (EIF2AK2 or PKR) and stress granule formation. Strikingly, ORF45 protein of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and YopM protein of Yersinia use the same peptide motif as L to recruit and activate RSKs. All three proteins interact with a conserved surface-located loop of RSKs, likely acting as an allosteric regulation site. Some unrelated viruses and bacteria thus evolved to harness RSKs in a common fashion, yet to target distinct aspects of innate immunity. As documented for Varicella zoster virus ORF11, additional pathogens likely evolved to hijack RSKs, using a similar short linear motif.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emulating Membrane Protein Environments─How Much Lipid Is Required for a Native Structure: Influenza S31N M2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35089701/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report investigates the homotetrameric membrane protein structure of the S31N M2 protein from Influenza A virus in the presence of a high molar ratio of lipid. The structured regions of this protein include a single transmembrane helix and an amphipathic helix. Two structures of the S31N M2 conductance domain from Influenza A virus have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). These structures present different symmetries about the channel main axis. We present new magic angle spinning and oriented sample solid-state NMR spectroscopic data for S31N M2 in liquid crystalline lipid bilayers using protein tetramer:lipid molar ratios ranging from 1:120 to 1:240. The data is consistent with an essentially 4-fold-symmetric structure very similar to the M2 WT structure that also has a single conformation for the four monomers, except at the His37 and Trp41 functional sites when characterized in samples with a high molar ratio of lipid. While detergent solubilization is well recognized today as a nonideal environment for small membrane proteins, here we discuss the influence of a high lipid to protein ratio for samples of the S31N M2 protein to stabilize an essentially 4-fold-symmetric conformation of the M2 membrane protein. While it is generally accepted that the chemical and physical properties of the native environment of membrane proteins needs to be reproduced judiciously to achieve the native protein structure, here we show that not only the character of the emulated membrane environment is important but also the abundance of the environment is important for achieving the native structure. This is a critical finding as a membrane protein spectroscopist&amp;rsquo;s goal is always to generate a sample with the highest possible protein sensitivity while obtaining spectra of the native-like structure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human genetic and immunological determinants of critical COVID-19 pneumonia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35090163/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection is benign in most individuals but, in around 10% of cases, it triggers hypoxaemic COVID-19 pneumonia, which leads to critical illness in around 3% of cases. The ensuing risk of death (approximately 1% across age and gender) doubles every five years from childhood onwards and is around 1.5 times greater in men than in women. Here we review the molecular and cellular determinants of critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Inborn errors of type I interferons (IFNs), including autosomal TLR3 and X-chromosome-linked TLR7 deficiencies, are found in around 1-5% of patients with critical pneumonia under 60 years old, and a lower proportion in older patients. Pre-existing auto-antibodies neutralizing IFNα, IFNβ and/or IFNω, which are more common in men than in women, are found in approximately 15-20% of patients with critical pneumonia over 70 years old, and a lower proportion in younger patients. Thus, at least 15% of cases of critical COVID-19 pneumonia can be explained. The TLR3- and TLR7-dependent production of type I IFNs by respiratory epithelial cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, respectively, is essential for host defence against SARS-CoV-2. In ways that can depend on age and sex, insufficient type I IFN immunity in the respiratory tract during the first few days of infection may account for the spread of the virus, leading to pulmonary and systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protein Palmitoylation Modification During Viral Infection and Detection Methods of Palmitoylated Proteins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein palmitoylation-a lipid modification in which one or more cysteine thiols on a substrate protein are modified to form a thioester with a palmitoyl group-is a significant post-translational biological process. This process regulates the trafficking, subcellular localization, and stability of different proteins in cells. Since palmitoylation participates in various biological processes, it is related to the occurrence and development of multiple diseases. It has been well evidenced that the proteins whose functions are palmitoylation-dependent or directly involved in key proteins&amp;rsquo; palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle may be a potential source of novel therapeutic drugs for the related diseases. Many researchers have reported palmitoylation of proteins, which are crucial for host-virus interactions during viral infection. Quite a few explorations have focused on figuring out whether targeting the acylation of viral or host proteins might be a strategy to combat viral diseases. All these remarkable achievements in protein palmitoylation have been made to technological advances. This paper gives an overview of protein palmitoylation modification during viral infection and the methods for palmitoylated protein detection. Future challenges and potential developments are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evolutionary Landscapes of Host-Virus Arms Races</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertebrate immune systems suppress viral infection using both innate restriction factors and adaptive immunity. Viruses mutate to escape these defenses, driving hosts to counterevolve to regain fitness. This cycle recurs repeatedly, resulting in an evolutionary arms race whose outcome depends on the pace and likelihood of adaptation by host and viral genes. Although viruses evolve faster than their vertebrate hosts, their proteins are subject to numerous functional constraints that impact the probability of adaptation. These constraints are globally defined by evolutionary landscapes, which describe the fitness and adaptive potential of all possible mutations. We review deep mutational scanning experiments mapping the evolutionary landscapes of both host and viral proteins engaged in arms races. For restriction factors and some broadly neutralizing antibodies, landscapes favor the host, which may help to level the evolutionary playing field against rapidly evolving viruses. We discuss the biophysical underpinnings of these landscapes and their therapeutic implications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MGF360-9L Is a Major Virulence Factor Associated with the African Swine Fever Virus by Antagonizing the JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35076286/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African swine fever (ASF)-an aggressive infectious disease caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV)-is significantly unfavorable for swine production. ASFV has a complex structure and encodes 150-167 proteins; however, the function of most of these proteins is unknown. This study identified ASFV MGF360-9L as a negative regulator of the interferon (IFN)-β signal. Further evidence showed that MGF360-9L interacts with signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2 and degrades STAT1 and STAT2 through apoptosis and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways, respectively. Subsequently, the activation of IFN-β signaling was inhibited. Naturally isolated or genetically manipulated live attenuated viruses are known to protect against the virulent parental ASFV strains. Therefore, through homologous recombination, we deleted MGF360-9L from the virulent ASFV CN/GS/2018 strain to construct a recombinant strain, ASFV-Δ360-9L. Compared with the parent ASFV CN/GS/2018 strain, the replication level of ASFV-Δ360-9L decreased in primary porcine alveolar macrophage cultures at 24 h postinfection, but the difference is unlikely to be biologically relevant. Notably, ASFV-Δ360-9L was partially attenuated in pigs. To our knowledge, this study is the first to uncover the function of MGF360-9L during ASFV infection. MGF360-9L inhibits IFN-β signaling through the targeted degradation of STAT1 and STAT2. Furthermore, MGF360-9L is a key virulence gene of ASFV. Our findings reveal a new mechanism by which ASFV inhibits host antiviral response; this might facilitate the development of live attenuated ASFV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African swine fever-an acute, febrile, hemorrhagic, highly contacting, and highly lethal disease caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV)-jeopardizes the global pig industry. Understanding the mechanism ASFV employs to evade host defense during infection is essential for developing targeted drugs and vaccines against ASFV. To our knowledge, this study identifies the mechanism of innate immunity against by MGF360-9L and the effect of MGF360-9L on ASFV pathogenicity. The results showed that MGF360-9L may help ASFV escape the host immunity by degrading STAT1 and STAT2 and thus inhibiting IFN-β signaling. MGF360-9L is also an important virulence factor of ASFV. The deletion of MGF360-9L reduces ASFV virulence in pigs. This study explored a new mechanism of ASFV against innate immunity and identified a new ASFV virulence factor; these findings may guide the development of live attenuated ASFV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 NSP5 and N protein counteract the RIG-I signaling pathway by suppressing the formation of stress granules</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35075101/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a highly pathogenic human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has to counteract an intricate network of antiviral host responses to establish infection and spread. The nucleic acid-induced stress response is an essential component of antiviral defense and is closely related to antiviral innate immunity. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 regulates the stress response pathway to achieve immune evasion remains elusive. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 NSP5 and N protein were found to attenuate antiviral stress granule (avSG) formation. Moreover, NSP5 and N suppressed IFN expression induced by infection of Sendai virus or transfection of a synthetic mimic of dsRNA, poly (I:C), inhibiting TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylation, and restraining the nuclear translocalization of IRF3. Furthermore, HEK293T cells with ectopic expression of NSP5 or N protein were less resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus infection. Mechanistically, NSP5 suppressed avSG formation and disrupted RIG-I-MAVS complex to attenuate the RIG-I-mediated antiviral immunity. In contrast to the multiple targets of NSP5, the N protein specifically targeted cofactors upstream of RIG-I. The N protein interacted with G3BP1 to prevent avSG formation and to keep the cofactors G3BP1 and PACT from activating RIG-I. Additionally, the N protein also affected the recognition of dsRNA by RIG-I. This study revealed the intimate correlation between SARS-CoV-2, the stress response, and innate antiviral immunity, shedding light on the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MICU1-dependent mitochondrial calcium uptake regulates lung alveolar type 2 cell plasticity and lung regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35050901/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells are progenitors for alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells. Although many factors regulate AT2 cell plasticity, the role of mitochondrial calcium (&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) uptake in controlling AT2 cells remains unclear. We previously identified that the miR-302 family supports lung epithelial progenitor cell proliferation and less differentiated phenotypes during development. Here, we report that a sustained elevation of miR-302 in adult AT2 cells decreases AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation during the Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced lung injury repair. We identified that miR-302 targets and represses the expression of mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake 1 (MICU1), which regulates &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake through the &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uniporter channel by acting as a gatekeeper at low cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. Our results reveal a marked increase in MICU1 protein expression and decreased &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake during AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation in the adult lung. Deletion of &lt;em&gt;Micu1&lt;/em&gt; in AT2 cells reduces AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation during steady-state tissue maintenance and alveolar epithelial regeneration after bacterial pneumonia. These studies indicate that &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake is extensively modulated during AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation and that MICU1-dependent &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uniporter channel gating is a prominent mechanism modulating AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The cGAS-STING pathway drives type I IFN immunopathology in COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35045565/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19, which is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, is characterized by lung pathology and extrapulmonary complications. Type I interferons (IFNs) have an essential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Although rapid induction of type I IFNs limits virus propagation, a sustained increase in the levels of type I IFNs in the late phase of the infection is associated with aberrant inflammation and poor clinical outcome. Here we show that the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, which controls immunity to cytosolic DNA, is a critical driver of aberrant type I IFN responses in COVID-19. Profiling COVID-19 skin manifestations, we uncover a STING-dependent type I IFN signature that is primarily mediated by macrophages adjacent to areas of endothelial cell damage. Moreover, cGAS-STING activity was detected in lung samples from patients with COVID-19 with prominent tissue destruction, and was associated with type I IFN responses. A lung-on-chip model revealed that, in addition to macrophages, infection with SARS-CoV-2 activates cGAS-STING signalling in endothelial cells through mitochondrial DNA release, which leads to cell death and type I IFN production. In mice, pharmacological inhibition of STING reduces severe lung inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 and improves disease outcome. Collectively, our study establishes a mechanistic basis of pathological type I IFN responses in COVID-19 and reveals a principle for the development of host-directed therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using online surveys, we collected data regarding COVID-19-related loss of smell or taste from 69,841 individuals. We performed a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study and identified a genome-wide significant locus in the vicinity of the UGT2A1 and UGT2A2 genes. Both genes are expressed in the olfactory epithelium and play a role in metabolizing odorants. These findings provide a genetic link to the biological mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related loss of smell or taste.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 evolution in specific geographies may help predict properties of the variants that come from these regions. We mapped neutralization of a SARS-CoV-2 strain that evolved over 6 months from ancestral virus in a person with advanced HIV disease in South Africa; this person was infected prior to emergence of the Beta and Delta variants. We longitudinally tracked the evolved virus and tested it against self-plasma and convalescent plasma from ancestral, Beta, and Delta infections. Early virus was similar to ancestral, but it evolved a multitude of mutations found in Omicron and other variants. It showed substantial but incomplete Pfizer BNT162b2 escape, weak neutralization by self-plasma, and despite pre-dating Delta, it also showed extensive escape of Delta infection-elicited neutralization. This example is consistent with the notion that SARS-CoV-2 evolving in individual immune-compromised hosts, including those with advanced HIV disease, may gain immune escape of vaccines and enhanced escape of Delta immunity, and this has implications for vaccine breakthrough and reinfections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many viral infections including influenza. Therefore, there is a need for therapeutic interventions that dampen and redirect inflammatory responses and, ideally, exert antiviral effects. Itaconate is an immunomodulatory metabolite which also reprograms cell metabolism and inflammatory responses when applied exogenously. We evaluated effects of endogenous itaconate and exogenous application of itaconate and its variants dimethyl- and 4-octyl-itaconate (DI, 4OI) on host responses to influenza A virus (IAV). Infection induced expression of ACOD1, the enzyme catalyzing itaconate synthesis, in monocytes and macrophages, which correlated with viral replication and was abrogated by DI and 4OI treatment. In IAV-infected mice, pulmonary inflammation and weight loss were greater in Acod1-/- than in wild-type mice, and DI treatment reduced pulmonary inflammation and mortality. The compounds reversed infection-triggered interferon responses and modulated inflammation in human cells supporting non-productive and productive infection, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in human lung tissue. All three itaconates reduced ROS levels and STAT1 phosphorylation, whereas AKT phosphorylation was reduced by 4OI and DI but increased by itaconate. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified monocytes as the main target of infection and the exclusive source of ACOD1 mRNA in peripheral blood. DI treatment silenced IFN-responses predominantly in monocytes, but also in lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Ectopic synthesis of itaconate in A549 cells, which do not physiologically express ACOD1, reduced infection-driven inflammation, and DI reduced IAV- and IFNγ-induced CXCL10 expression in murine macrophages independent of the presence of endogenous ACOD1. The compounds differed greatly in their effects on cellular gene homeostasis and released cytokines/chemokines, but all three markedly reduced release of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL2 (MCP-1). Viral replication did not increase under treatment despite the dramatically repressed IFN responses. In fact, 4OI strongly inhibited viral transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the compounds reduced viral titers (4OI&amp;gt;Ita&amp;gt;DI) in A549 cells whereas viral transcription was unaffected. Taken together, these results reveal itaconates as immunomodulatory and antiviral interventions for influenza virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple respiratory viruses can concurrently or sequentially infect the respiratory tract and lead to virus‒virus interactions. Infection by a first virus could enhance or reduce infection and replication of a second virus, resulting in positive (additive or synergistic) or negative (antagonistic) interaction. The concept of viral interference has been demonstrated at the cellular, host, and population levels. The mechanisms involved in viral interference have been evaluated in differentiated airway epithelial cells and in animal models susceptible to the respiratory viruses of interest. A likely mechanism is the interferon response that could confer a temporary nonspecific immunity to the host. During the coronavirus disease pandemic, nonpharmacologic interventions have prevented the circulation of most respiratory viruses. Once the sanitary restrictions are lifted, circulation of seasonal respiratory viruses is expected to resume and will offer the opportunity to study their interactions, notably with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conformation of HIV-1 Envelope Governs Rhesus CD4 Usage and Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Virus Replication</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35012342/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infection of rhesus macaques with simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) is the preferred model system for vaccine development because SHIVs encode human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins (Envs)-a key target of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. Since the goal of vaccines is to prevent new infections, SHIVs encoding circulating HIV-1 Env are desired as challenge viruses. Development of such biologically relevant SHIVs has been challenging, as they fail to infect rhesus macaques, mainly because most circulating HIV-1 Envs do not use rhesus CD4 (rhCD4) receptor for viral entry. Most primary HIV-1 Envs exist in a closed conformation and occasionally transit to a downstream, open conformation through an obligate intermediate conformation. Here, we provide genetic evidence that open Env conformations can overcome the rhCD4 entry barrier and increase replication of SHIVs in rhesus lymphocytes. Consistent with prior studies, we found that circulating HIV-1 Envs do not use rhCD4 efficiently for viral entry. However, by using HIV-1 Envs with single amino acid substitutions that alter their conformational state, we found that transitions to intermediate and open Env conformations allow usage of physiological levels of rhCD4 for viral entry. We engineered these single amino acid substitutions in the transmitted/founder HIV-1BG505 Envs encoded by SHIV-BG505 and found that open Env conformation enhances SHIV replication in rhesus lymphocytes. Lastly, CD4-mediated SHIV pulldown, sensitivity to soluble CD4, and fusogenicity assays indicated that open Env conformation promotes efficient rhCD4 binding and viral-host membrane fusion. These findings identify the conformational state of HIV-1 Env as a major determinant for rhCD4 usage, viral fusion, and SHIV replication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhesus macaques are a critical animal model for preclinical testing of HIV-1 vaccine and prevention approaches. However, HIV-1 does not replicate in rhesus macaques, and thus, chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs), which encode HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), are used as surrogate challenge viruses to infect rhesus macaques for modeling HIV-1 infection. Development of SHIVs encoding Envs from clinically relevant, circulating HIV-1 variants has been extremely challenging, as such SHIVs replicate poorly, if at all, in rhesus lymphocytes. This is most probably because many circulating HIV-1 Envs do not use rhesus CD4 efficiently for viral entry. In this study, we identified conformational state of HIV-1 envelope as a key determinant for rhesus CD4 usage, viral-host membrane fusion, and SHIV replication in rhesus lymphocytes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MRSA-induced endothelial permeability and acute lung injury are attenuated by FTY720 S-phosphonate</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35015568/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disruption of the lung endothelial barrier is a hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which no effective pharmacologic treatments exist. Prior work has demonstrated that FTY720 S-phosphonate (Tys), an analog of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and FTY720, exhibits potent endothelial cell (EC) barrier protective properties. In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of Tys against methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA), a frequent bacterial cause of ARDS. Tys-protected human lung EC from barrier disruption induced by heat-killed MRSA (HK-MRSA) or staphylococcal α-toxin and attenuated MRSA-induced cytoskeletal changes associated with barrier disruption, including actin stress fiber formation and loss of peripheral VE-cadherin and cortactin. Tys-inhibited Rho and myosin light chain (MLC) activation after MRSA and blocked MRSA-induced NF-κB activation and release of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8. In vivo, intratracheal administration of live MRSA in mice caused significant vascular leakage and leukocyte infiltration into the alveolar space. Pre- or posttreatment with Tys attenuated MRSA-induced lung permeability and levels of alveolar neutrophils. Posttreatment with Tys significantly reduced levels of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) VCAM-1 and plasma IL-6 and KC induced by MRSA. Dynamic intravital imaging of mouse lungs demonstrated Tys attenuation of HK-MRSA-induced interstitial edema and neutrophil infiltration into lung tissue. Tys did not directly inhibit MRSA growth or viability in vitro. In conclusion, Tys inhibits lung EC barrier disruption and proinflammatory signaling induced by MRSA in vitro and attenuates acute lung injury induced by MRSA in vivo. These results support the potential utility of Tys as a novel ARDS therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diverse facets of MDSC in different phases of chronic HBV infection: Impact on HBV-specific T-cell response and homing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35000202/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35000202/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic HBV infection (CHI) is associated with a diverse natural history that includes immune-tolerant (IT), HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) (EP-CHB), inactive carrier, and HBeAg-negative CHB (EN-CHB) phases. A hallmark of CHI is impairment of HBV-specific T-cell response. Recently, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have emerged as key regulator of T cells, and their properties are sculpted by their microenvironment. Here, we investigated the distinctive features of MDSCs during CHI, identified factors responsible for their functional discrepancies, and studied their impact on HBV-specific T-cell response and homing. Influence of antiviral therapy on MDSC profile and T-cell response was also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt; Flow cytometric analysis indicated that MDSCs in EP-CHB/EN-CHB patients had profound suppressive ability, expressing arginase 1 (Arg1)/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4)/CD40 at significantly greater levels relative to healthy controls (HC). However, in IT, only Arg1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MDSCs and in inactive carrier, iNOS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and PD-L1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MDSCs were higher than HC. In vitro assays demonstrated that high HBsAg titer in IT/CHB induced Arg1+ MDSC. Furthermore, elevated serum TNF-α and IL-4 in CHB potentiated Arg1/PD-L1/CD40/CTLA-4 expression, whereas increased IL-1β in CHB/IC triggered the expansion of PD-L1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MDSCs and iNOS+ MDSCs. MDSCs, sorted from CHB/IC, greatly attenuated IL-2/interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production by HBV-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, the effect being more pronounced in CHB. However, MDSCs of IT minimally affected the cytokine production by T cells. Adding Arg1-/iNOS-inhibitor restored only IFN-γ production, while neutralizing PD-L1 recovered both IL-2 and IFN-γ secretion by T cells. Moreover, MDSCs from IT/CHB disrupted virus-specific T-cell trafficking by down-regulating chemokine receptor type 5 on them via TGF-β signaling. One year of tenofovir therapy failed to normalize MDSC phenotype and HBV-specific T-cell response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Diversity of MDSCs during CHI affects HBV-specific T-cell response and homing. Hence, therapeutic targeting of MDSCs could boost anti-HBV immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MVIP: multi-omics portal of viral infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virus infections are huge threats to living organisms and cause many diseases, such as COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has led to millions of deaths. To develop effective strategies to control viral infection, we need to understand its molecular events in host cells. Virus related functional genomic datasets are growing rapidly, however, an integrative platform for systematically investigating host responses to viruses is missing. Here, we developed a user-friendly multi-omics portal of viral infection named as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mvip.whu.edu.cn/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MVIP&lt;/a&gt;. We manually collected available high-throughput sequencing data under viral infection, and unified their detailed metadata including virus, host species, infection time, assay, and target, etc. We processed multi-layered omics data of more than 4900 viral infected samples from 77 viruses and 33 host species with standard pipelines, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and CLIP-seq, etc. In addition, we integrated these genome-wide signals into customized genome browsers, and developed multiple dynamic charts to exhibit the information, such as time-course dynamic and differential gene expression profiles, alternative splicing changes and enriched GO/KEGG terms. Furthermore, we implemented several tools for efficiently mining the virus-host interactions by virus, host and genes. &lt;a href=&#34;https://mvip.whu.edu.cn/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MVIP&lt;/a&gt; would help users to retrieve large-scale functional information and promote the understanding of virus-host interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CRISPRi links COVID-19 GWAS loci to LZTFL1 and RAVER1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34998241/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34998241/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; To identify host genetic variants (SNPs) associated with COVID-19 disease severity, a number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted. Since most of the identified variants are located at non-coding regions, such variants are presumed to affect the expression of neighbouring genes, thereby influencing COVID-19 disease severity. However, it remains largely unknown which genes are influenced by such COVID-19 GWAS loci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; CRISPRi (interference)-mediated gene expression analysis was performed to identify genes functionally regulated by COVID-19 GWAS loci by targeting regions near the loci (SNPs) in lung epithelial cell lines. The expression of CRISPRi-identified genes was investigated using COVID-19-contracted human and monkey lung single-nucleus/cell (sn/sc) RNA-seq datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Findings:&lt;/em&gt; CRISPRi analysis indicated that a region near rs11385942 at chromosome 3p21.31 (locus of highest significance with COVID-19 disease severity at intron 5 of LZTFL1) significantly affected the expression of LZTFL1 (P&amp;lt;0.05), an airway cilia regulator. A region near rs74956615 at chromosome 19p13.2 (locus located at the 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated exonic region of RAVER1), which is associated with critical illness in COVID-19, affected the expression of RAVER1 (P&amp;lt;0.05), a coactivator of MDA5 (IFIH1), which induces antiviral response genes, including ICAM1. The sn/scRNA-seq datasets indicated that the MDA5/RAVER1-ICAM1 pathway was activated in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19-resistant monkeys but not those of COVID-19-succumbed humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/em&gt; Patients with risk alleles of rs11385942 and rs74956615 may be susceptible to critical illness in COVID-19 in part through weakened airway viral clearance via LZTFL1-mediated ciliogenesis and diminished antiviral immune response via the MDA5/RAVER1 pathway, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibrotic lung disease inhibits immune responses to staphylococcal pneumonia via impaired neutrophil and macrophage function</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34990413/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease characterized by collagen deposition within the lung interstitium. Bacterial infection is associated with increased morbidity and more rapid mortality in IPF patient populations, and pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are commonly isolated from the lungs of hospitalized patients with IPF. Despite this, the effects of fibrotic lung injury on critical immune responses to infection remain unknown. In the present study, we show that, like humans with IPF, fibrotic mice infected with MRSA exhibit increased morbidity and mortality compared with uninfected fibrotic mice. We determine that fibrosis conferred a defect in MRSA clearance compared with nonfibrotic mice, resulting from blunted innate immune responses. We show that fibrosis inhibited neutrophil intracellular killing of MRSA through impaired neutrophil elastase release and oxidative radical production. Additionally, we demonstrate that lung macrophages from fibrotic mice have impaired phagocytosis of MRSA. Our study describes potentially novel impairments of antimicrobial responses upon pulmonary fibrosis development, and our findings suggest a possible mechanism for why patients with IPF are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality related to infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) and Covid-19: A new frontiers for therapeutic modality</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35032828/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are solid inflammatory reactions due to neutrophil recruitments and formation of NETs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustained formations of NETs during respiratory viral infections are associated with collateral tissue injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anti-NETs of natural or synthetic sources may mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced complications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NETs can inactivate a wide range of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NETs can trigger innate immunity through activation release of interferon from dendritic cells and adaptive immunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a worldwide infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is severe inflammatory reactions due to neutrophil recruitments and infiltration in the different organs with the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which involved various complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the objective of the present review was to explore the potential role of NETs in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify the targeting drugs against NETs in Covid-19 patients. Different enzyme types are involved in the formation of NETs, such as neutrophil elastase (NE), which degrades nuclear protein and release histones, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (PADA4), which releases chromosomal DNA and gasdermin D, which creates pores in the NTs cell membrane that facilitating expulsion of NT contents. Despite of the beneficial effects of NETs in controlling of invading pathogens, sustained formations of NETs during respiratory viral infections are associated with collateral tissue injury. Excessive development of NETs in SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked with the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to creation of the NETs-IL-1β loop. Also, aberrant NTs activation alone or through NETs formation may augment SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm (CS) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) in patients with severe Covid-19. Furthermore, NETs formation in SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with immuno-thrombosis and the development of ALI/ARDS. Therefore, anti-NETs therapy of natural or synthetic sources may mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced exaggerated immune response, hyperinflammation, immuno-thrombosis, and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-Covid pulmonary fibrosis is evident following severe COVID-19. There is an urgent need to identify the cellular and pathophysiological characteristics of chronic lung squeals of Covid-19 for the development of future preventive and/or therapeutic interventions. Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells can mediate local immune protection against infections and cancer. Less beneficially, lung TRM cells cause chronic airway inflammation and fibrosis by stimulating pathologic inflammation. The effects of Janus kinase (JAK), an inducer pathway of cytokine storm, inhibition on acute Covid-19 cases have been previously evaluated. Here, we propose that Tofacitinib by targeting the CD8+ TRM cells could be a potential candidate for the treatment of chronic lung diseases induced by acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pandemic Influenza Infection Promotes Streptococcus pneumoniae Infiltration, Necrotic Damage, and Proteomic Remodeling in the Heart</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over a century, it has been reported that primary influenza infection promotes the development of a lethal form of bacterial pulmonary disease. More recently, pneumonia events caused by both viruses and bacteria have been directly associated with cardiac damage. Importantly, it is not known whether viral-bacterial synergy extends to extrapulmonary organs such as the heart. Using label-free quantitative proteomics and molecular approaches, we report that primary infection with pandemic influenza A virus leads to increased Streptococcus pneumoniae translocation to the myocardium, leading to general biological alterations. We also observed that each infection alone led to proteomic changes in the heart, and these were exacerbated in the secondary bacterial infection (SBI) model. Gene ontology analysis of significantly upregulated proteins showed increased innate immune activity, oxidative processes, and changes to ion homeostasis during SBI. Immunoblots confirmed increased complement and antioxidant activity in addition to increased expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Using an &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; model of sequential infection in human cardiomyocytes, we observed that influenza enhances S. pneumoniae cytotoxicity by promoting oxidative stress enhancing bacterial toxin-induced necrotic cell death. Influenza infection was found to increase receptors that promote bacterial adhesion, such as polymeric immunoglobulin receptor and fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 1 in cardiomyocytes. Finally, mice deficient in programmed necrosis (i.e., necroptosis) showed enhanced innate immune responses, decreased virus-associated pathways, and promotion of mitochondrial function upon SBI. The presented results provide the first &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; evidence that influenza infection promotes S. pneumoniae infiltration, necrotic damage, and proteomic remodeling of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adverse cardiac events are a common complication of viral and bacterial pneumonia. For over a century, it has been recognized that influenza infection promotes severe forms of pulmonary disease mainly caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. The extrapulmonary effects of secondary bacterial infections to influenza virus are not known. In the present study, we used a combination of quantitative proteomics and molecular approaches to assess the underlying mechanisms of how influenza infection promotes bacteria-driven cardiac damage and proteome remodeling. We further observed that programmed necrosis (i.e., necroptosis) inhibition leads to reduced damage and proteome changes associated with health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trained immunity induction by the inactivated mucosal vaccine MV130 protects against experimental viral respiratory infections</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MV130 is an inactivated polybacterial mucosal vaccine that confers protection to patients against recurrent respiratory infections, including those of viral etiology. However, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we find that intranasal prophylaxis with MV130 modulates the lung immune landscape and provides long-term heterologous protection against viral respiratory infections in mice. Intranasal administration of MV130 provides protection against systemic candidiasis in wild-type and Rag1-deficient mice lacking functional lymphocytes, indicative of innate immune-mediated protection. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of trained immunity with metformin abrogates the protection conferred by MV130 against influenza A virus respiratory infection. MV130 induces reprogramming of both mouse bone marrow progenitor cells and in vitro human monocytes, promoting an enhanced cytokine production that relies on a metabolic shift. Our results unveil that the mucosal administration of a fully inactivated bacterial vaccine provides protection against viral infections by a mechanism associated with the induction of trained immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fatal COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Is Associated with Incomplete Alveolar Type 1 Epithelial Cell Differentiation from the Transitional State without Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34973949/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 and other etiologies results from injury to the alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) barrier resulting in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, which causes acute respiratory failure; recovery requires epithelial regeneration. During physiological regeneration in mice, type 2 AECs (AEC2s) proliferate, exit the cell cycle, transiently assume a transitional state, then differentiate into type 1 AECs (AEC1s); in humans, persistence of the transitional state is associated with pulmonary fibrosis. It is unknown whether transitional cells emerge and differentiate into AEC1s without fibrosis in human ARDS and why transitional cells differentiate into AEC1s during physiological regeneration but persist in fibrosis. We hypothesized that incomplete but ongoing AEC1 differentiation from transitional cells without fibrosis may underlie persistent barrier permeability and acute respiratory failure in ARDS. Immunostaining of postmortem ARDS lungs revealed abundant transitional cells without fibrosis. They were typically cuboidal or partially spread, sometimes flat, and occasionally expressed AEC1 markers. Immunostaining and/or single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that transitional cells in mouse models of physiological regeneration, ARDS, and fibrosis express markers of cell cycle exit but only in fibrosis express a specific senescence marker. Thus, in severe, fatal early ARDS, AEC1 differentiation from transitional cells is incomplete, underlying persistent barrier permeability and respiratory failure but ongoing without fibrosis; senescence of transitional cells may be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phospholipase A2 inhibitor and LY6/PLAUR domain-containing protein PINLYP regulates type I interferon innate immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34969857/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses serve as the first line of the host innate immune defense against viral infection. Here we identify a previously uncharacterized protein designated phospholipase A2 inhibitor and LY6/PLAUR domain-containing protein (PINLYP), which is essential for embryonic development and plays an important role in type I IFN against pathogen infection. PINLYP deficiency impairs type I IFN production and dampens in vivo host defense against DNA and RNA virus infection. We unravel a unique actor in the type I IFN innate immunity and a potential target for the antiviral therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferons (IFNs) are the first frontline of the host innate immune response against invading pathogens. Herein, we characterized an unknown protein encoded by phospholipase A2 inhibitor and LY6/PLAUR domain-containing (PINLYP) gene that interacted with TBK1 and induced type I IFN in a TBK1- and IRF3-dependent manner. Loss of PINLYP impaired the activation of IRF3 and production of IFN-β induced by DNA virus, RNA virus, and various Toll-like receptor ligands in multiple cell types. Because PINLYP deficiency in mice engendered an early embryonic lethality in mice, we generated a conditional mouse in which PINLYP was depleted in dendritic cells. Mice lacking PINLYP in dendritic cells were defective in type I IFN induction and more susceptible to lethal virus infection. Thus, PINLYP is a positive regulator of type I IFN innate immunity and important for effective host defense against viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Severe COVID-19 is marked by activated, highly cytotoxic CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immune-complex-mediated degranulation of CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells causes endothelial cell injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C3a-rich environment in severe COVID-19 promotes differentiation of CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activated CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and complement proteins are associated with fatal outcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe COVID-19 is linked to both dysfunctional immune response and unrestrained immunopathology, and it remains unclear whether T cells contribute to disease pathology. Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and single-cell proteomics with mechanistic studies to assess pathogenic T cell functions and inducing signals. We identified highly activated CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells with increased cytotoxic functions in severe COVID-19. CD16 expression enabled immune-complex-mediated, T cell receptor-independent degranulation and cytotoxicity not found in other diseases. CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells from COVID-19 patients promoted microvascular endothelial cell injury and release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Increased generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cytotoxic T cells. Proportions of activated CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a were associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, supporting a pathological role of exacerbated cytotoxicity and complement activation in COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory infected by COVID-19 represents a major global health problem at moment even after recovery from virus corona. Since, the lung lesions for infected patients are still sufferings from acute respiratory distress syndrome including alveolar septal edema, pneumonia, hyperplasia, and hyaline membranes Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify additional candidates having ability to overcome inflammatory process and can enhance efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. The polypenolic extracts were integrated into moeties of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then were coated by chitosan as a mucoadhesion polymer. The results of interleukin-6, and c-reactive protein showed significant reduction in group treated by Encap. SIL + CUR (64 ± 0.8 Pg/μL &amp;amp; 6 ± 0.5 μg/μL) compared to group treated by Cham. + CUR (102 ± 0.8 Pg/μL &amp;amp; 7 ± 0.5 μg/μL) respectively and free capsules (with no any drug inside) (148 ± 0.6 Pg/μL &amp;amp; 10 ± 0.6 μg/μL) respectively. Histopathology profile was improved completely. Additionally, encapsulating silymarin showed anti-viral activity in vitro COVID-19 experiment. It can be summarized that muco-inhalable delivery system (MIDS) loaded by silymarin can be used to overcome inflammation induced by oleic acid and to overcome COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COVID-19 patients present tubulo-interstitial kidney fibrosis compared with controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates profibrotic signaling in human kidney organoids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection can be inhibited by a protease blocker in human kidney organoids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidney failure is frequently observed during and after COVID-19, but it remains elusive whether this is a direct effect of the virus. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects kidney cells and is associated with increased tubule-interstitial kidney fibrosis in patient autopsy samples. To study direct effects of the virus on the kidney independent of systemic effects of COVID-19, we infected human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived kidney organoids with SARS-CoV-2. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicated injury and dedifferentiation of infected cells with activation of profibrotic signaling pathways. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection also led to increased collagen 1 protein expression in organoids. A SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor was able to ameliorate the infection of kidney cells by SARS-CoV-2. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect kidney cells and induce cell injury with subsequent fibrosis. These data could explain both acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and the development of chronic kidney disease in long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disulfiram (DSF) attenuated MCMV-infected pneumonia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSF suppressed NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway in MCMV-infected mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSF inhibited inflammatory response in MCMV-infected BMDMs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSF reduced viral loads in MCMV-infected mice and BMDMs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals is associated with damaging hyperinflammation and leads to high morbidity and mortality. It is urgently needed to develop new strategies to treat CMV-induced pneumonia. As disulfiram (DSF) reportedly inhibits inflammatory responses in different disease models, its therapeutic effects in CMV-induced pneumonia are proposed. In this study, we demonstrated that DSF effectively attenuated pulmonary injury and improved survival in murine CMV (MCMV) pneumonia model. DSF treatment inhibited lung inflammatory responses, e.g. reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokine, and lowering the accumulation of leukocytes in the lung. Similar to the in vivo results, DSF attenuated inflammatory responses and modulated NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in MCMV-infected BMDMs. Furthermore, DSF reduced pulmonary fibrosis and viral loads in MCMV pneumonia mice and BMDMs. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory effects of DSF may due to its regulating NF-κB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Collectively, our results suggest that DSF-mediated anti-hyperinflammatory effects have potentials for therapy of human CMV pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Proteins Inhibit Infection by the Kaposi&#39;s Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus and the Related Rhesus Monkey Rhadinovirus in a Cell-Specific Manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34933450/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are broad-spectrum antiviral proteins that inhibit the entry of enveloped viruses. We analyzed the effect of IFITMs on the gamma-2 herpesviruses Kaposi&amp;rsquo;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and the closely related rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV). We used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout to generate A549 cells, human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with combined IFITM1/2/3 knockout and identified IFITMs as cell-dependent inhibitors of KSHV and RRV infection in A549 cells and HFF but not HUVEC. IFITM overexpression revealed IFITM1 as the relevant IFITM that inhibits KSHV and RRV infection. Fluorescent KSHV particles did not pronouncedly colocalize with IFITM-positive compartments. However, we found that KSHV and RRV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion is enhanced upon IFITM1/2/3 knockout. Taken together, we identified IFITM1 as a cell-dependent restriction factor of KSHV and RRV that acts at the level of membrane fusion. Of note, our results indicate that recombinant IFITM overexpression may lead to results that are not representative for the situation at endogenous levels. Strikingly, we observed that the endotheliotropic KSHV circumvents IFITM-mediated restriction in HUVEC despite high IFITM expression, while influenza A virus (IAV) glycoprotein-driven entry into HUVEC is potently restricted by IFITMs even in the absence of interferon. Mechanistically, we found that KSHV colocalizes less with IFITM1 and IFITM2 in HUVEC than in A549 cells immediately after attachment, potentially contributing to the observed difference in restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFITM proteins are the first line of defense against infection by many pathogens and may also have therapeutic importance, as they, among other effectors, mediate the antiviral effect of interferons. Neither their function against herpesviruses nor their mechanism of action is well understood. We report here that in some cells but not in, for example, primary umbilical vein endothelial cells, IFITM1 restricts KSHV and RRV and that, mechanistically, this is likely effected by reducing the fusogenicity of the cell membrane. Further, we demonstrate potent inhibition of IAV glycoprotein-driven infection of cells of extrapulmonary origin by high constitutive IFITM expression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STING-Mediated Interferon Induction by Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Requires the Protein Tyrosine Kinase Syk</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34933455/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature and the intensity of innate immune response to virus infection determine the course of pathogenesis in the host. Among the many pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors, STING, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein, plays a pivotal role in triggering responses to microbial or cellular cytoplasmic DNA. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a common human pathogen, activates STING signaling, and the resultant induction of type I interferon causes inhibition of virus replication. In this context, we have observed that phosphorylation of Tyr245 of STING by epidermal growth factor receptor kinase is necessary for interferon induction. Here, we report that phosphorylation of Tyr240 by the tyrosine kinase Syk is essential for all signaling activities of STING. Our analysis showed that upon ligand-binding, STING dimerizes and interacts with membrane-bound EGFR, which autophosphorylates and provides the platform for the recruitment of cytoplasmic Syk to the signaling complex and its activation. Activated Syk phosphorylates Tyr240 of STING, followed by phosphorylation of Tyr245 by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Pharmacological or genetic ablation of Syk activity resulted in an arrest of STING in the ER compartment and a complete block of gene induction. Consequently, in the absence of Syk, HSV-1 could not induce interferon, and it replicated more robustly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune response to virus infection leads to interferon production and inhibition of viral replication. STING, an ER-bound protein, mediates such a response to cytoplasmic cellular or microbial DNA. HSV-1, a DNA virus, activates STING, and it replicates more efficiently in the absence of STING signaling. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tyr240 of STING by the protein tyrosine kinase Syk is essential for STING-mediated gene induction. To signal, ligand-activated STING recruits two kinases, Syk and EGFR, which phosphorylate Tyr240 and Tyr245, respectively. The dependence of STING signaling on Syk has broad significance, because STING plays a major role in many microbial, mitochondrial, and autoimmune diseases as well as in cancer development and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nonclassical autophagy activation pathways are essential for production of infectious Influenza A virus in vitro</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is a critical mechanism deployed by eukaryotic cells in response to stress, including viral infection, to boost the innate antimicrobial responses. However, an increasing number of pathogens hijack the autophagic machinery to facilitate their own replication. Influenza A virus (IAV), responsible for several global pandemics, has an intricate dependence on autophagy for successful replication in mammalian cells. To elucidate key chokepoints in the host stress responses facilitating IAV replication, we constructed a meta-transcriptome of IAV and host gene expression dynamics during early (1-3 hpi), mid (4-6 hpi), and late (8-12 hpi) stages of the viral replication cycle at two multiplicities of infection (MOI): 1 and 5. We supplemented the global transcriptome study with phosphoproteomic analysis of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) signaling in lung carcinoma (predominantly used as an in vitro model of IAV replication) and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. We report significant differences in the activation profiles of autophagy regulating genes upon IAV infection at the two MOI as well as divergent dependence on ULK1 signaling within the normal and cancer cells. Regardless of the cell model, JNK-Thr187 signaling was crucial for the production of infectious viral particles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VLDLR and ApoER2 are receptors for multiple alphaviruses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34929721/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alphaviruses, like many other arthropod-borne viruses, infect vertebrate species and insect vectors separated by hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary history. Entry into evolutionarily divergent host cells can be accomplished by recognition of different cellular receptors in different species, or by binding to receptors that are highly conserved across species. Although multiple alphavirus receptors have been described1-3, most are not shared among vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Here we identify the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) as a receptor for the prototypic alphavirus Semliki forest virus. We show that the E2 and E1 glycoproteins (E2-E1) of Semliki forest virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus and Sindbis virus interact with the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of VLDLR and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), two closely related receptors. Ectopic expression of either protein facilitates cellular attachment, and internalization of virus-like particles, a VLDLR LBD-Fc fusion protein or a ligand-binding antagonist block Semliki forest virus E2-E1-mediated infection of human and mouse neurons in culture. The administration of a VLDLR LBD-Fc fusion protein has protective activity against rapidly fatal Semliki forest virus infection in mouse neonates. We further show that invertebrate receptor orthologues from mosquitoes and worms can serve as functional alphavirus receptors. We propose that the ability of some alphaviruses to infect a wide range of hosts is a result of their engagement of evolutionarily conserved lipoprotein receptors and contributes to their pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell death forms an essential component of the antiviral immune response. Viral infection elicits different forms of host cell death, including the lytic and inflammatory cell death modes necroptosis or pyroptosis. The induction of both types of cell death not only eliminates virus-infected cells but also contributes to the development of innate and adaptive immunity through the release of inflammatory mediators. The importance of necroptosis and pyroptosis in host defence is evident from the numerous viral evasion mechanisms that suppress these cell death pathways. Here, we review the emerging principles by which viruses antagonise host cell necroptosis and pyroptosis to promote their spread and block host immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection results in impaired interferon response in patients with severe COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 interferes with host immune responses is incompletely understood. Here, we sequence small RNAs from SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells and identify a microRNA (miRNA) derived from a recently evolved region of the viral genome. We show that the virus-derived miRNA produces two miRNA isoforms in infected cells by the enzyme Dicer, which are loaded into Argonaute proteins. Moreover, the predominant miRNA isoform targets the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR of interferon-stimulated genes and represses their expression in a miRNA-like fashion. Finally, the two viral miRNA isoforms were detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 can potentially employ a virus-derived miRNA to hijack the host miRNA machinery, which could help to evade the interferon-mediated immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A functionally distinct neutrophil landscape in severe COVID-19 reveals opportunities for adjunctive therapies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34908534/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening syndrome, constituted by respiratory failure and diffuse alveolar damage that results from dysregulated local and systemic immune activation, causing pulmonary vascular, parenchymal, and alveolar damage. SARS-CoV-2 infection has become the dominant cause of ARDS worldwide, and emerging evidence implicates neutrophils and their cytotoxic arsenal of effector functions as central drivers of immune-mediated lung injury in COVID-19 ARDS. However, key outstanding questions are whether COVID-19 drives a unique program of neutrophil activation or effector functions that contribute to the severe pathogenesis of this pandemic illness and whether this unique neutrophil response can be targeted to attenuate disease. Using a combination of high-dimensional single-cell analysis and ex vivo functional assays of neutrophils from patients with COVID-19 ARDS, compared with those with non-COVID ARDS (caused by bacterial pneumonia), we identified a functionally distinct landscape of neutrophil activation in COVID-19 ARDS that was intrinsically programmed during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, neutrophils in COVID-19 ARDS were functionally primed to produce high amounts of neutrophil extracellular traps. Surprisingly, this unique pathological program of neutrophil priming escaped conventional therapy with dexamethasone, thereby revealing a promising target for adjunctive immunotherapy in severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Highly conserved s2m element of SARS-CoV-2 dimerizes via a kissing complex and interacts with host miRNA-1307-3p</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34908151/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the necessity for a more fundamental understanding of the coronavirus life cycle. The causative agent of the disease, SARS-CoV-2, is being studied extensively from a structural standpoint in order to gain insight into key molecular mechanisms required for its survival. Contained within the untranslated regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are various conserved stem-loop elements that are believed to function in RNA replication, viral protein translation, and discontinuous transcription. While the majority of these regions are variable in sequence, a 41-nucleotide s2m element within the genome 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated region is highly conserved among coronaviruses and three other viral families. In this study, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 s2m element dimerizes by forming an intermediate homodimeric kissing complex structure that is subsequently converted to a thermodynamically stable duplex conformation. This process is aided by the viral nucleocapsid protein, potentially indicating a role in mediating genome dimerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the s2m element interacts with multiple copies of host cellular microRNA (miRNA) 1307-3p. Taken together, our results highlight the potential significance of the dimer structures formed by the s2m element in key biological processes and implicate the motif as a possible therapeutic drug target for COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Kinase MAP4K1 Inhibits Cytosolic RNA-Induced Antiviral Signaling by Promoting Proteasomal Degradation of TBK1/IKKε</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34908452/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/IκB kinase-ε (IKKε) mediates robust production of type I interferons (IFN-I) and proinflammatory cytokines to restrict the spread of invading viruses. However, excessive or prolonged production of IFN-I is harmful to the host by causing autoimmune disorders. In this study, we identified that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP4K1) is a negative regulator in the RLR signaling pathway. Notably, MAP4K1 promotes the degradation of TBK1/IKKε by K48-linked ubiquitination via the ubiquitin ligase DTX4, leading to the negative regulation of the IFN signaling pathway. Previous studies showed that MAP4K1 has a pivotal function in adaptive immune responses. This study identifies that MAP4K1 also plays a vital role in innate immunity and outlines a novel mechanism by which the IFN signaling pathway is tightly controlled to avoid excessive inflammation. Our study documents a novel TBK1 inhibitor, which serves as a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases, and elucidated a significant function for MAP4K1 linked to innate immunity in addition to subsequent adaptive immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/IκB kinase-ε (IKKε) mediates robust production of type I interferons (IFN-I) and proinflammatory cytokines in response to acute viral infection. However, excessive or prolonged production of IFN-I is harmful and even fatal to the host by causing autoimmune disorders. In this study, we identified mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP4K1) as a negative regulator in the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway. MAP4K1, a member of Ste20-like serine/threonine kinases, was previously known as a prominent regulator in adaptive immunity by downregulating T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. However, its role in regulating antiviral innate immune signaling is still unclear. This study reports an undiscovered role of MAP4K1, which inhibits RLR signaling by targeting TBK1/IKKε for proteasomal degradation via the ubiquitin ligase DTX4. We initially identify MAP4K1 as an interacting partner of TBK1 by yeast two-hybrid screens and subsequently investigate its function in RLR-mediated antiviral signaling pathways. Overexpression of MAP4K1 significantly inhibits RNA virus-triggered activation of IFN-β and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Consistently, knockdown or knockout experiments show opposite effects. Furthermore, MAP4K1 promotes the degradation of TBK1/IKKε by K48-linked ubiquitination via DTX4. Knockdown of DTX4 abrogated the ubiquitination and degradation of TBK1/IKKε. Collectively, our results identify that MAP4K1 acts as a negative regulator in antiviral innate immunity by targeting TBK1/IKKε, discover a novel TBK1 inhibitor, and extend a novel functional role of MAP4K1 in immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rotavirus NSP1 Contributes to Intestinal Viral Replication, Pathogenesis, and Transmission</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34903043/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotavirus (RV)-encoded nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1), the product of gene segment 5, effectively antagonizes host interferon (IFN) signaling via multiple mechanisms. Recent studies with the newly established RV reverse genetics system indicate that NSP1 is not essential for the replication of the simian RV SA11 strain in cell culture. However, the role of NSP1 in RV infection &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; remains poorly characterized due to the limited replication of heterologous simian RVs in the suckling mouse model. Here, we used an optimized reverse genetics system and successfully recovered recombinant murine RVs with or without NSP1 expression. While the NSP1-null virus replicated comparably with the parental murine RV in IFN-deficient and IFN-competent cell lines &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, it was highly attenuated in 5-day-old wild-type suckling pups in both the 129sv and C57BL/6 backgrounds. In the absence of NSP1 expression, murine RV had significantly reduced replication in the ileum, systemic spread to mesenteric lymph nodes, fecal shedding, diarrhea occurrence, and transmission to uninoculated littermates. The defective replication of the NSP1-null RV in small intestinal tissues occurred as early as 1 day postinfection. Of interest, the replication and pathogenesis defects of NSP1-null RV were only minimally rescued in &lt;em&gt;Stat1&lt;/em&gt; knockout pups, suggesting that NSP1 facilitates RV replication in an IFN-independent manner. Our findings highlight a pivotal function of NSP1 during homologous RV infections &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and identify NSP1 as an ideal viral protein for targeted attenuation for future vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotavirus remains one of the most important causes of severe diarrhea and dehydration in young children worldwide. Although NSP1 is dispensable for rotavirus replication in cell culture, its exact role in virus infection &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate, for the first time in a pathologically valid homologous small animal model, that in the context of a fully replication-competent, pathogenic, and transmissible murine rotavirus, loss of NSP1 expression substantially attenuated virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract, diarrheal disease, and virus transmission. Notably, the NSP1-deficient murine rotavirus also replicated poorly in mice lacking host interferon or inflammasome signaling. Our data provide the first piece of evidence that NSP1 is essential for murine rotavirus replication &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, making it an attractive target for developing improved next-generation rotavirus vaccines better suited for socioeconomically disadvantaged and immunocompromised individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating Ubiquitous RNA, A Highly Predictive and Prognostic Biomarker in Hospitalized Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34894121/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Approximately 15-30% of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic tissue injury, and/or multi-organ failure leading to death in around 45% of cases. There is a clear need for biomarkers that quantify tissue injury, predict clinical outcomes, and guide the clinical management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We herein report the quantification by droplet-based digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNAemia and the plasmatic release of a ubiquitous human intracellular marker, the ribonuclease P (RNase P) in order to evaluate tissue injury and cell lysis in the plasma of 139 COVID-19 hospitalized patients at admission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia was associated with clinical severity of COVID-19 patients. In addition, we showed that plasmatic RNase P RNAemia at admission was also highly correlated with disease severity (P &amp;lt; .001) and invasive mechanical ventilation status (P &amp;lt; .001) but not with pulmonary severity. Altogether, these results indicate a consequent cell lysis process in severe and critical patients but not systematically due to lung cell death. Finally, the plasmatic RNase P RNA value was also significantly associated with overall survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Viral and ubiquitous blood biomarkers monitored by ddPCR could be useful for the clinical monitoring and the management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Moreover, these results could pave the way for new and more personalized circulating biomarkers in COVID-19, and more generally in infectious diseases, specific from each patient organ injury profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The systemic processes involved in the manifestation of life-threatening COVID-19 and in disease recovery are still incompletely understood, despite investigations focusing on the dysregulation of immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To define hallmarks of severe COVID-19 in acute disease (n = 58) and in disease recovery in convalescent patients (n = 28) from Hannover Medical School, we used flow cytometry and proteomics data with unsupervised clustering analyses. In our observational study, we combined analyses of immune cells and cytokine/chemokine networks with endothelial activation and injury. ICU patients displayed an altered immune signature with prolonged lymphopenia but the expansion of granulocytes and plasmablasts along with activated and terminally differentiated T and NK cells and high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The core signature of seven plasma proteins revealed a highly inflammatory microenvironment in addition to endothelial injury in severe COVID-19. Changes within this signature were associated with either disease progression or recovery. In summary, our data suggest that besides a strong inflammatory response, severe COVID-19 is driven by endothelial activation and barrier disruption, whereby recovery depends on the regeneration of the endothelial integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The short isoform of the host antiviral protein ZAP acts as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a fundamental gene expression event in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It allows production of essential viral, structural and replicative enzymes that are encoded in an alternative reading frame. Despite the importance of PRF for the viral life cycle, it is still largely unknown how and to what extent cellular factors alter mechanical properties of frameshift elements and thereby impact virulence. This prompted us to comprehensively dissect the interplay between the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift element and the host proteome. We reveal that the short isoform of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP-S) is a direct regulator of PRF in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. ZAP-S overexpression strongly impairs frameshifting and inhibits viral replication. Using in vitro ensemble and single-molecule techniques, we further demonstrate that ZAP-S directly interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and interferes with the folding of the frameshift RNA element. Together, these data identify ZAP-S as a host-encoded inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting and expand our understanding of RNA-based gene regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus nsp4 positively regulates cellular cholesterol to inhibit type I interferon production</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34911669/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellular cholesterol plays an important role in the life cycles of enveloped viruses. Previous studies by our group and other groups have demonstrated that the depletion of cellular cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) reduces the proliferation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a porcine Arterivirus that has been devastating the swine industry worldwide for over two decades. However, how PRRSV infection regulates cholesterol synthesis is not fully understood. In this study, we showed that PRRSV infection upregulated the activity of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), which subsequently activated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, to increase the levels of cellular cholesterol. By screening the PRRSV-encoded proteins, we showed that nsp4 dominated the upregulation of cellular cholesterol, independently of the 3C-like protease activity of nsp4. A mutation analysis showed that domain I (amino acids 1-80) of PRRSV nsp4 interacted with PR65 alpha (PR65α), the structural subunit, and PP2Ac, the catalytic subunit, of PP2A. Importantly, domain I of nsp4 inhibited Sendai virus-induced interferon β production, and this inhibitory effect was eliminated by Lovastatin, an HMGCR inhibitor, indicating that the upregulation of cellular cholesterol by nsp4 is a strategy used by PRRSV to suppress the antiviral innate immunity of its host. Collectively, we here demonstrated the mechanism by which PRRSV regulates cellular cholesterol synthesis and reported a novel strategy by which PRRSV evades its host&amp;rsquo;s antiviral innate immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upper and lower respiratory tract correlates of protection against respiratory syncytial virus following vaccination of nonhuman primates</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34879230/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique antibody profiles are induced by six distinct vaccine platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correlates of protection against RSV differ by compartment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IgA levels, neutralization, and complement are key in the upper respiratory tract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fc-effector functions correlate with RSV restriction in the lower respiratory tract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of respiratory illness in infants and the elderly. Although several vaccines have been developed, none have succeeded in part due to our incomplete understanding of the correlates of immune protection. While both T cells and antibodies play a role, emerging data suggest that antibody-mediated mechanisms alone may be sufficient to provide protection. Therefore, to map the humoral correlates of immunity against RSV, antibody responses across six different vaccines were profiled in a highly controlled nonhuman primate-challenge model. Viral loads were monitored in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and machine learning was used to determine the vaccine platform-agnostic antibody features associated with protection. Upper respiratory control was associated with virus-specific IgA levels, neutralization, and complement activity, whereas lower respiratory control was associated with Fc-mediated effector mechanisms. These findings provide critical compartment-specific insights toward the rational development of future vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFP35 as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for the syndromes induced by SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34910942/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serum IFP35 levels in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 correlate with severity of the syndrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFP35 is released by macrophages and lung epithelial cells under influenza infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFP35 neutralizing antibodies reduce lung injury and mortality of infected mice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFP35 serves as a biomarker and as a therapeutic target in virus-induced syndromes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that the high mortality caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus primarily results from complications of a cytokine storm. Therefore, it is critical to identify the key factors participating in the cytokine storm. Here we demonstrate that interferon-induced protein 35 (IFP35) plays an important role in the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection. We find that the levels of serum IFP35 in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 correlates with severity of the syndrome. Using mouse model and cell assays, we show that IFP35 is released by lung epithelial cells and macrophages after SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus infection. In addition, we show that administration of neutralizing antibodies against IFP35 considerably reduces lung injury and, thus, the mortality rate of mice exposed to viral infection. Our findings suggest that IFP35 serves as a biomarker and as a therapeutic target in virus-induced syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The oxidative stress response of pathogenic Leptospira is controlled by two peroxide stress regulators which putatively cooperate in controlling virulence</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34855911/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34855911/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic Leptospira are the causative agents of leptospirosis, the most widespread zoonotic infectious disease. Leptospirosis is a potentially severe and life-threatening emerging disease with highest burden in sub-tropical areas and impoverished populations. Mechanisms allowing pathogenic Leptospira to survive inside a host and induce acute leptospirosis are not fully understood. The ability to resist deadly oxidants produced by the host during infection is pivotal for Leptospira virulence. We have previously shown that genes encoding defenses against oxidants in L. interrogans are repressed by PerRA (encoded by LIMLP_10155), a peroxide stress regulator of the Fur family. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of another putative PerR-like regulator (LIMLP_05620) in L. interrogans. Protein sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicated that LIMLP_05620 displayed all the canonical PerR amino acid residues and is restricted to pathogenic Leptospira clades. We therefore named this PerR-like regulator PerRB. In L. interrogans, the PerRB regulon is distinct from that of PerRA. While a perRA mutant had a greater tolerance to peroxide, inactivating perRB led to a higher tolerance to superoxide, suggesting that these two regulators have a distinct function in the adaptation of L. interrogans to oxidative stress. The concomitant inactivation of perRA and perRB resulted in a higher tolerance to both peroxide and superoxide and, unlike the single mutants, a double perRAperRB mutant was avirulent. Interestingly, this correlated with major changes in gene and non-coding RNA expression. Notably, several virulence-associated genes (clpB, ligA/B, and lvrAB) were repressed. By obtaining a double mutant in a pathogenic Leptospira strain, our study has uncovered an interplay of two PerRs in the adaptation of Leptospira to oxidative stress with a putative role in virulence and pathogenicity, most likely through the transcriptional control of a complex regulatory network.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cell intrinsic antiviral response of multicellular organisms developed over millions of years and critically relies on the ability to sense and eliminate viral nucleic acids. Here we use an affinity proteomics approach in evolutionary distant species (human, mouse and fly) to identify proteins that are conserved in their ability to associate with diverse viral nucleic acids. This approach shows a core of orthologous proteins targeting viral genetic material and species-specific interactions. Functional characterization of the influence of 181 candidates on replication of 6 distinct viruses in human cells and flies identifies 128 nucleic acid binding proteins with an impact on virus growth. We identify the family of TAO kinases (TAOK1, -2 and -3) as dsRNA-interacting antiviral proteins and show their requirement for type-I interferon induction. Depletion of TAO kinases in mammals or flies leads to an impaired response to virus infection characterized by a reduced induction of interferon stimulated genes in mammals and impaired expression of srg1 and diedel in flies. Overall, our study shows a larger set of proteins able to mediate the interaction between viral genetic material and host factors than anticipated so far, attesting to the ancestral roots of innate immunity and to the lineage-specific pressures exerted by viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time Series Transcriptomic Analysis of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Cells from Piglets Infected with Virulent or Low-Virulent Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus 1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34851149/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has evolved to escape the immune surveillance for a survival advantage leading to a strong modulation of host&amp;rsquo;s immune responses and favoring secondary bacterial infections. However, limited data are available on how the immunological and transcriptional responses elicited by virulent and low-virulent PRRSV-1 strains are comparable and how they are conserved during the infection. To explore the kinetic transcriptional signature associated with the modulation of host immune response at lung level, a time-series transcriptomic analysis was performed in bronchoalveolar lavage cells upon experimental in vivo infection with two PRRSV-1 strains of different virulence, virulent subtype 3 Lena strain or the low-virulent subtype 1 3249 strain. The time-series analysis revealed overlapping patterns of dysregulated genes enriched in T-cell signaling pathways among both virulent and low-virulent strains, highlighting an upregulation of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory immune checkpoints that were disclosed as Hub genes. On the other hand, virulent Lena infection induced an early and more marked &amp;ldquo;negative regulation of immune system process&amp;rdquo; with an overexpression of co-inhibitory receptors genes related to T-cell and NK cell functions, in association with more severe lung lesion, lung viral load, and BAL cell kinetics. These results underline a complex network of molecular mechanisms governing PRRSV-1 immunopathogenesis at lung level, revealing a pivotal role of co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoints in the pulmonary disease, which may have an impact on T-cell activation and related pathways. These immune checkpoints, together with the regulation of cytokine-signaling pathways, modulated in a virulence-dependent fashion, orchestrate an interplay among pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the major threats to swine health and global production, causing substantial economic losses. We explore the mechanisms involved in the modulation of host immune response at lung level performing a time-series transcriptomic analysis upon experimental infection with two PRRSV-1 strains of different virulence. A complex network of molecular mechanisms was revealed to control the immunopathogenesis of PRRSV-1 infection, highlighting an interplay among pro- and anti-inflammatory responses as a potential mechanism to restrict inflammation-induced lung injury. Moreover, a pivotal role of co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoints was evidenced, which may lead to progressive dysfunction of T cells, impairing viral clearance and leading to persistent infection, favoring as well secondary bacterial infections or viral rebound. However, further studies should be conducted to evaluate the functional role of immune checkpoints in advanced stages of PRRSV infection and explore a possible T-cell exhaustion state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upper airway innate defenses are crucial for host protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines influences host immune response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sepsis-like immune dysfunction contributes to host tissue damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial morbidity and mortality to humanity. Remarkable progress has been made in understanding both the innate and adaptive mechanisms involved in the host response to the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus, but much remains to be discovered. Robust upper airway defenses are critical in restricting SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation. Further, the nasal abundance of viral uptake receptor, ACE2, and the host epithelial transcriptional landscape, are associated with differential disease outcomes across different patient cohorts. The adaptive host response to systemic COVID-19 is heterogeneous and complex. Blunted responses to interferon and robust cytokine generation are hallmarks of the disease, particularly at the advanced stages. Excessive immune cell influx into tissues can lead to substantial collateral damage to the host akin to sepsis. This review offers a contemporary summary of these mechanisms of disease and highlights potential avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic development. These include improved disease stratification, targeting effectors of immune-mediated tissue damage, and blunting of immune cell-mediated tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19-induced &amp;ldquo;acute respiratory distress syndrome&amp;rdquo; (ARDS) is associated with prolonged respiratory failure and high mortality, but the mechanistic basis of lung injury remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyze pulmonary immune responses and lung pathology in two cohorts of patients with COVID-19 ARDS using functional single-cell genomics, immunohistology, and electron microscopy. We describe an accumulation of CD163-expressing monocyte-derived macrophages that acquired a profibrotic transcriptional phenotype during COVID-19 ARDS. Gene set enrichment and computational data integration revealed a significant similarity between COVID-19-associated macrophages and profibrotic macrophage populations identified in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. COVID-19 ARDS was associated with clinical, radiographic, histopathological, and ultrastructural hallmarks of pulmonary fibrosis. Exposure of human monocytes to SARS-CoV-2, but not influenza A virus or viral RNA analogs, was sufficient to induce a similar profibrotic phenotype in vitro. In conclusion, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 triggers profibrotic macrophage responses and pronounced fibroproliferative ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by lung injury, cytokine storm, and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Current therapies focus on reducing viral replication and inflammatory responses, but no specific treatment exists to prevent the development of severe COVID-19 in infected individuals. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, but it is also critical for maintaining the correct functionality of lung epithelium and endothelium. Coronaviruses induce activation of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) and shedding of ACE2 from the cell surface resulting in exacerbated inflammatory responses. Thus, we hypothesized that ADAM17 inhibition ameliorates COVID-19-related lung inflammation. We employed a preclinical mouse model using intratracheal instillation of a combination of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RBD-S) to mimic lung damage associated with COVID-19. Histologic analysis of inflamed mice confirmed the expected signs of lung injury including edema, fibrosis, vascular congestion, and leukocyte infiltration. Moreover, inflamed mice also showed an increased NLR as observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Administration of the ADAM17/MMP inhibitors apratastat and TMI-1 significantly improved lung histology and prevented leukocyte infiltration. Reduced leukocyte recruitment could be explained by reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines and lower levels of the endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Additionally, the NLR was significantly reduced by ADAM17/MMP inhibition. Thus, we propose inhibition of ADAM17/MMP as a novel promising treatment strategy in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to prevent the progression toward severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Infection Disturbs the Mitochondrial Network, Leading to Type I Interferon Production through the RNA Polymerase III/RIG-I Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34809467/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) impairs the mitochondrial network through the viral protein UL12.5. This leads to the fusion of mitochondria and simultaneous release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in a mouse model. We have shown that released mtDNA is recognized as a danger signal, capable of stimulating signaling pathways and inducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The expression of the human cytidine deaminase APOBEC3A is highly upregulated by interferon responses. This enzyme catalyzes the deamination of cytidine to uridine in single-stranded DNA substrates, resulting in the catabolism of edited DNA. Using human cell lines deprived of mtDNA and viral strains deficient in UL12, we demonstrated the implication of mtDNA in the production of interferon and APOBEC3A expression during viral infection. We have shown that HSV-1 induces mitochondrial network fragmentation in a human model and confirmed the implication of RNA polymerase III/RIG-I signaling in the capture of cytosolic mtDNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses have evolved a plethora of mechanisms to impair host innate immune responses. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a double-stranded linear DNA virus, impairs the mitochondrial network and dynamics predominantly through the UL12.5 gene. We demonstrated that HSV-1 infection induced a remodeling of mitochondrial shape, resulting in a fragmentation of the mitochondria associated with a decrease in their volume and an increase in their sphericity. This damage leads to the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol. By generating a stable THP-1 cell line expressing the DNase I-mCherry fusion protein and a THP-1 cell line specifically depleted of mtDNA upon ethidium bromide treatment, we showed that cytosolic mtDNA contributes to type I interferon and APOBEC3A upregulation. This was confirmed by using an HSV-1 strain (KOS37 UL98-SPA) with a deletion of the UL12.5 gene that impaired its ability to induce mtDNA stress. Furthermore, by using an inhibitor of RNA polymerase III, we demonstrated that upon HSV-1 infection, cytosolic mtDNA enhanced type I interferon induction through the RNA polymerase III/RIG-I pathway. APOBEC3A was in turn induced by interferon. Deep sequencing analyses of cytosolic mtDNA mutations revealed an APOBEC3A signature predominantly in the 5&amp;rsquo;TpCpG context. These data demonstrate that upon HSV-1 infection, the mitochondrial network is disrupted, leading to the release of mtDNA and ultimately to its catabolism through APOBEC3-induced mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 N Protein Induces Acute Kidney Injury via Smad3-Dependent G1 Cell Cycle Arrest Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34813685/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that the selective overactivation of autophagy can cause cell death with unique morphological features distinct from apoptosis or necrosis. This unique type of autophagic cell death, termed “autosis,” occurs not only &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; but also in vivo in cerebral hypoxia–ischemia. Moreover, autosis is inhibited both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; by cardiac glycosides, which are Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase antagonists used in clinical medicine. Our findings contribute to the basic understanding of cell-death mechanisms and suggest strategies for protecting cells against stresses such as hypoxia–ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and can cause severe multiple organ injury and death. Kidney is one of major target organs of COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, mechanisms through which COVID-19 causes AKI remain largely unknown and treatment remains unspecific and ineffective. Here, the authors report that normal kidney-specifically overexpressing SARS-CoV-2 N develops AKI, which worsens in mice under ischemic condition. Mechanistically, it is uncovered that SARS-CoV-2 N-induced AKI is Smad3-dependent as SARS-CoV-2 N protein can interact with Smad3 and enhance TGF-β/Smad3 signaling to cause tubular epithelial cell death and AKI via the G1 cell cycle arrest mechanism. This is further confirmed in Smad3 knockout mice and cells in which deletion of Smad3 protects against SARS-CoV-2 N protein-induced cell death and AKI in vivo and in vitro. Most significantly, it is also found that targeting Smad3 with a Smad3 pharmacological inhibitor is able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 N-induced AKI. In conclusion, the authors identify that SARS-CoV-2 N protein is a key mediator for AKI and induces AKI via the Smad3-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest mechanism. Targeting Smad3 may represent as a novel therapy for COVID-19-asscoaited AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell landscape of peripheral immune responses to fatal SFTS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single-cell landscape of peripheral immune responses is reprogrammed in SFTS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exacerbated IFN-I response is related to hyper-inflammation and fatal outcome in SFTS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intermediate monocytes and IFN-I-inducible plasmablasts are major targets for SFTSV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease with high fatality. Poor prognosis of SFTS has been associated with dysregulated host immunity; however, the immune patterns associated with pathophysiology involving SFTS exacerbation remain unclear. Here, we show that the single-cell landscape of peripheral immune responses is reprogrammed in SFTS and characterized by monocyte shift to an intermediate type along with complement activation, perturbation of plasmablast composition, and highly exhausted T cells, all correlated with lethal consequences. We identify the overexpression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes across most immune cell types after SFTSV infection, which are simultaneously related to older age, high viremia, and a hyperinflammatory response. A retrospective clinical study reveals no efficiency of IFN-α in treating SFTS. These data collectively support the intermediate monocytes and IFN-I-inducible plasmablasts to be major targets for SFTS virus infection, and they indicate the pivotal role of the IFN-I response in exacerbating hyperinflammation and lethal SFTS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A defective viral genome strategy elicits broad protective immunity against respiratory viruses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eTIP1 is a novel tool to protect against viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 strains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intranasal eTIP1 delivery elicits innate antiviral responses in the respiratory tract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eTIP1 provides pre- and post-exposure protection against respiratory viral infections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eTIP1 treatment boosts generation of protective antibodies against pathogenic virus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA viruses generate defective viral genomes (DVGs) that can interfere with replication of the parental wild-type virus. To examine their therapeutic potential, we created a DVG by deleting the capsid-coding region of poliovirus. Strikingly, intraperitoneal or intranasal administration of this genome, which we termed eTIP1, elicits an antiviral response, inhibits replication, and protects mice from several RNA viruses, including enteroviruses, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. While eTIP1 replication following intranasal administration is limited to the nasal cavity, its antiviral action extends non-cell-autonomously to the lungs. eTIP1 broad-spectrum antiviral effects are mediated by both local and distal type I interferon responses. Importantly, while a single eTIP1 dose protects animals from SARS-CoV-2 infection, it also stimulates production of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies that afford long-lasting protection from SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Thus, eTIP1 is a safe and effective broad-spectrum antiviral generating short- and long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past decade has seen near continual global public health crises caused by emerging viral infections. Extraordinary increases in our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying successful antiviral immune responses in animal models and during human infection have accompanied these viral outbreaks. Keeping pace with the rapidly advancing field of viral immunology, innovations in microscopy have afforded a previously unseen view of viral infection occurring in real-time in living animals. Here, we review the contribution of intravital imaging to our understanding of cell-mediated immune responses to viral infections, with a particular focus on studies that visualize the antiviral effector cells responding to infection as well as virus-infected cells. We discuss methods to visualize viral infection in vivo using intravital microscopy (IVM) and significant findings arising through the application of IVM to viral infection. Collectively, these works underscore the importance of developing a comprehensive spatial understanding of the relationships between immune effectors and virus-infected cells and how this has enabled unique discoveries about virus/host interactions and antiviral effector cell biology.&lt;/p&gt;

Our findings contribute to the basic understanding of cell-death mechanisms and suggest strategies for protecting cells against stresses such as hypoxia–ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by lung inflammation and pulmonary edema. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with ARDS in the more severe cases. This study aimed to compare the specificity of the metabolic alterations induced by COVID-19 or Influenza A pneumonia (IAP) in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Eighteen patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and twenty patients with ARDS due to IAP, admitted to the intensive care unit. ARDS was defined as in the American-European Consensus Conference. As compared with patients with COVID-19, patients with IAP were younger and received more often noradrenaline to maintain a mean arterial pressure &amp;gt; 65 mm Hg. Serum samples were analyzed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Multivariate Statistical Analyses were used to identify metabolic differences between groups. Metabolic pathway analysis was performed to identify the most relevant pathways involved in ARDS development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; ARDS due to COVID-19 or to IAP induces a different regulation of amino acids metabolism, lipid metabolism, glycolysis, and anaplerotic metabolism. COVID-19 causes a significant energy supply deficit that induces supplementary energy-generating pathways. In contrast, IAP patients suffer more marked inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. The classificatory model discriminated against the cause of pneumonia with a success rate of 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings support the concept that ARDS is associated with a characteristic metabolomic profile that may discriminate patients with ARDS of different etiologies, being a potential biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a causative virus in the development of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Respiratory manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection such as acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leads to hypoxia, oxidative stress, and sympatho-activation and in severe cases leads to sympathetic storm (SS). On the other hand, an exaggerated immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 invasion may lead to uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokine development of cytokine storm (CS). In Covid-19, there are interactive interactions between CS and SS in the development of multi-organ failure (MOF). Interestingly, cutting the bridge between CS and SS by anti-inflammatory and anti-adrenergic agents may mitigate complications that are induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in severely affected Covid-19 patients. The potential mechanisms of SS in Covid-19 are through different pathways such as hypoxia, which activate the central sympathetic center through carotid bodies chemosensory input and induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, which cross the blood-brain barrier and activation of the sympathetic center. β2-receptors signaling pathway play a crucial role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, macrophage activation, and B-cells for the production of antibodies with inflammation exacerbation. β-blockers have anti-inflammatory effects through reduction release of pro-inflammatory cytokines with inhibition of NF-κB. In conclusion, β-blockers interrupt this interaction through inhibition of several mediators of CS and SS with prevention development of neural-cytokine loop in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence from this study triggers an idea for future prospective studies to confirm the potential role of β-blockers in the management of Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innate antiviral defenses are crucial for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COVID-19 clinical heterogeneity is associated with variability in innate immunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impairments in the interferon response account for COVID-19 severity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type I and type III interferons are promising therapeutics for COVID-19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emerged pathogen that has caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the worst pandemic of our times leading to tremendous loss of human life and unprecedented measures of social distancing. COVID-19 symptom manifestations range from asymptomatic disease to severe and lethal outcomes. Lack of previous exposure and immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and high infectivity of the virus have contributed to its broad spread across the globe. In the absence of specific adaptive immunity, innate immune mechanisms are crucial for efficient antiviral defenses and control of the infection. Accumulating evidence now suggests that the remarkable heterogeneity in COVID-19 disease manifestations is due to variable degrees of impairment of innate immune mechanisms. In this review, we summarize recent findings describing both viral and host intrinsic factors that have been linked to defective innate immune responses and account for severe COVID-19. We also discuss emerging therapeutic opportunities for targeting innate immunity for the treatment of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is an essential transductor for initiation of many immune responses. Here, we show that lncRNA-ISIR directly binds IRF3 to promote its phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation, along with enhanced target gene productions. In vivo lncRNA-ISIR deficiency results in reduced IFN production, uncontrolled viral replication, and increased mortality. The human homolog, AK131315, also binds IRF3 and promotes its activation. More important, AK131315 expression is positively correlated with type I interferon (IFN-I) level and severity in patients with lupus. Mechanistically, in resting cells, IRF3 is bound to suppressor protein Flightless-1 (Fli-1), which keeps its inactive state. Upon infection, IFN-I-induced lncRNA-ISIR binds IRF3 at DNA-binding domain in cytoplasm and removes Fli-1&amp;rsquo;s association from IRF3, consequently facilitating IRF3 activation. Our results demonstrate that IFN-I-inducible lncRNA-ISIR feedback strengthens IRF3 activation by removing suppressive Fli-1 in immune responses, revealing a method of lncRNA-mediated modulation of transcription factor (TF) activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dsRNA induces liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of NLRP6 &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and in cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASC solidifies LLPS of NLRP6 and RNA to promote inflammasome activation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poly-Lysine region in NLRP6 is critical for multivalent interaction and LLPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase separation of NLRP6 promotes inflammasome activation in intestine and liver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NLRP6 is important in host defense by inducing functional outcomes including inflammasome activation and interferon production. Here, we show that NLRP6 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon interaction with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and in cells, and an intrinsically disordered poly-lysine sequence (K350-354) of NLRP6 is important for multivalent interactions, phase separation, and inflammasome activation. &lt;em&gt;Nlrp6&lt;/em&gt;-deficient or &lt;em&gt;Nlrp6&lt;sup&gt;K350-354A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mutant mice show reduced inflammasome activation upon mouse hepatitis virus or rotavirus infection, and in steady state stimulated by intestinal microbiota, implicating NLRP6 LLPS in anti-microbial immunity. Recruitment of ASC via helical assembly solidifies NLRP6 condensates, and ASC further recruits and activates caspase-1. Lipoteichoic acid, a known NLRP6 ligand, also promotes NLRP6 LLPS, and DHX15, a helicase in NLRP6-induced interferon signaling, co-forms condensates with NLRP6 and dsRNA. Thus, LLPS of NLRP6 is a common response to ligand stimulation, which serves to direct NLRP6 to distinct functional outcomes depending on the cellular context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 promotes RIPK1 activation to facilitate viral propagation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the ongoing global pandemic that poses substantial challenges to public health worldwide. A subset of COVID-19 patients experience systemic inflammatory response, known as cytokine storm, which may lead to death. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is an important mediator of inflammation and cell death. Here, we examined the interaction of RIPK1-mediated innate immunity with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found evidence of RIPK1 activation in human COVID-19 lung pathological samples, and cultured human lung organoids and ACE2 transgenic mice infected by SARS-CoV-2. Inhibition of RIPK1 using multiple small-molecule inhibitors reduced the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in human lung organoids. Furthermore, therapeutic dosing of the RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1s reduced mortality and lung viral load, and blocked the CNS manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2 transgenic mice. Mechanistically, we found that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2, NSP12, a highly conserved central component of coronaviral replication and transcription machinery, promoted the activation of RIPK1. Furthermore, NSP12 323L variant, encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 C14408T variant first detected in Lombardy, Italy, that carries a Pro323Leu amino acid substitution in NSP12, showed increased ability to activate RIPK1. Inhibition of RIPK1 downregulated the transcriptional induction of proinflammatory cytokines and host factors including ACE2 and EGFR that promote viral entry into cells. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may have an unexpected and unusual ability to hijack the RIPK1-mediated host defense response to promote its own propagation and that inhibition of RIPK1 may provide a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cis-acting lnc-Cxcl2 restrains neutrophil-mediated lung inflammation by inhibiting epithelial cell CXCL2 expression in virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34607953/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemokine production by epithelial cells is important for neutrophil recruitment during viral infection, the appropriate regulation of which is critical for restraining inflammation and attenuating subsequent tissue damage. Epithelial cell expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), RNA-binding proteins, and their functional interactions during viral infection and inflammation remain to be fully understood. Here, we identified an inducible lncRNA in the &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; gene locus, lnc-Cxcl2, which could selectively inhibit &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; expression in mouse lung epithelial cells but not in macrophages. lnc-Cxcl2-deficient mice exhibited increased &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; expression, enhanced neutrophils recruitment, and more severe inflammation in the lung after influenza virus infection. Mechanistically, nucleus-localized lnc-Cxcl2 bound to &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; promoter, recruited a ribonucleoprotein La, which inhibited the chromatin accessibility of chemokine promoters, and consequently inhibited &lt;em&gt;Cxcl2&lt;/em&gt; transcription in cis However, unlike mouse lnc-Cxcl2, human lnc-CXCL2-4-1 inhibited multiple immune cytokine expressions including chemokines in human lung epithelial cells. Together, our results demonstrate a self-protecting mechanism within epithelial cells to restrain chemokine and neutrophil-mediated inflammation, providing clues for better understanding chemokine regulation and epithelial cell function in lung viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanistic insights into COVID-19 by global analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro substrate degradome</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An atlas of 101 human cell substrates of SARS-CoV-2 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; and 58 candidate substrates is presented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; redundantly targets the hippo and antiviral xenophagy pathways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galectin-8 binds as an intracellular sensor for CoV-2 spike protein that 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; cuts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytosolic translocation of PTBP1 from the nucleus follows proteolytic removal of an NLS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main viral protease (3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;) is indispensable for SARS-CoV-2 replication. We delineate the human protein substrate landscape of 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; by TAILS substrate-targeted N-terminomics. We identify more than 100 substrates in human lung and kidney cells supported by analyses of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Enzyme kinetics and molecular docking simulations of 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; engaging substrates reveal how noncanonical cleavage sites, which diverge from SARS-CoV, guide substrate specificity. Cleaving the interactors of essential effector proteins, effectively stranding them from their binding partners, amplifies the consequences of proteolysis. We show that 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; targets the Hippo pathway, including inactivation of MAP4K5, and key effectors of transcription, mRNA processing, and translation. We demonstrate that Spike glycoprotein directly binds galectin-8, with galectin-8 cleavage disengaging CALCOCO2/NDP52 to decouple antiviral-autophagy. Indeed, in post-mortem COVID-19 lung samples, NDP52 rarely colocalizes with galectin-8, unlike in healthy lungs. The 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; substrate degradome establishes a foundational substrate atlas to accelerate exploration of SARS-CoV-2 pathology and drug design.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interactions of chemical components in ambient PM2.5 with influenza viruses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of this work is that ambient PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is a direct transmission mode for influenza virus infection to the human alveolar epithelium. The concentration of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; was 11.7 ± 5.5 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in Taipei during 24 December 2019-13 January 2020. Approximately 79% of inhaled PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is able to reach the upper-to-lower airway, and 47% of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is able to reach the alveolar epithelium for influenza virus infection. Influenza A and B viruses were detected in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; on 9 days, and the influenza A/H5 virus was detected on 15 days during the study period. FL and Pyr were negatively correlated with the influenza A virus. D(ah)P and Acp were positively correlated with the influenza B and A/H5 viruses, respectively. Cd, V, and Zn were positively correlated with the influenza A, B, and A/H5 viruses, respectively. Next, influenza A, B, and A/H5 viral plasmids interacted with carbon black, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, DEPs, and UD. We observed that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; significantly decreased levels of complementary DNA of the three influenza viruses. DEPs and UD significantly decreased influenza A and A/H5 viral levels. In conclusion, chemicals in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; may play vital roles in terms of viable influenza virus in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Virus-induced senescence is a driver and therapeutic target in COVID-19</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derailed cytokine and immune cell networks account for the organ damage and the clinical severity of COVID-19. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2, like other viruses, evokes cellular senescence as a primary stress response in infected cells. Virus-induced senescence (VIS) is indistinguishable from other forms of cellular senescence and is accompanied by a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which comprises pro-inflammatory cytokines, extracellular-matrix-active factors and pro-coagulatory mediators. Patients with COVID-19 displayed markers of senescence in their airway mucosa in situ and increased serum levels of SASP factors. In vitro assays demonstrated macrophage activation with SASP-reminiscent secretion, complement lysis and SASP-amplifying secondary senescence of endothelial cells, which mirrored hallmark features of COVID-19 such as macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, endothelial damage and widespread thrombosis in affected lung tissue. Moreover, supernatant from VIS cells, including SARS-CoV-2-induced senescence, induced neutrophil extracellular trap formation and activation of platelets and the clotting cascade. Senolytics such as navitoclax and a combination of dasatinib plus quercetin selectively eliminated VIS cells, mitigated COVID-19-reminiscent lung disease and reduced inflammation in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters and mice. Our findings mark VIS as a pathogenic trigger of COVID-19-related cytokine escalation and organ damage, and suggest that senolytic targeting of virus-infected cells is a treatment option against SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps other viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Biosafety Level 2 Mouse Model for Studying Betacoronavirus-Induced Acute Lung Damage and Systemic Manifestations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34495692/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of life-threatening zoonotic diseases caused by betacoronaviruses, including the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, has highlighted the need for developing preclinical models mirroring respiratory and systemic pathophysiological manifestations seen in infected humans. Here, we showed that C57BL/6J wild-type mice intranasally inoculated with the murine betacoronavirus murine hepatitis coronavirus 3 (MHV-3) develop a robust inflammatory response leading to acute lung injuries, including alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and fibrin thrombi. Although such histopathological changes seemed to resolve as the infection advanced, they efficiently impaired respiratory function, as the infected mice displayed restricted lung distention and increased respiratory frequency and ventilation. Following respiratory manifestation, the MHV-3 infection became systemic, and a high virus burden could be detected in multiple organs along with morphological changes. The systemic manifestation of MHV-3 infection was also marked by a sharp drop in the number of circulating platelets and lymphocytes, besides the augmented concentration of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-12, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), thereby mirroring some clinical features observed in moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. Importantly, both respiratory and systemic changes triggered by MHV-3 infection were greatly prevented by blocking TNF signaling, either via genetic or pharmacologic approaches. In line with this, TNF blockage also diminished the infection-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines and virus replication of human epithelial lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Collectively, results show that MHV-3 respiratory infection leads to a large range of clinical manifestations in mice and may constitute an attractive, lower-cost, biosafety level 2 (BSL2) in vivo platform for evaluating the respiratory and multiorgan involvement of betacoronavirus infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouse models have long been used as valuable in vivo platforms to investigate the pathogenesis of viral infections and effective countermeasures. The natural resistance of mice to the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has launched a race toward the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection in other animals (e.g., hamsters, cats, ferrets, bats, and monkeys), as well as adaptation of the mouse model, by modifying either the host or the virus. In the present study, we utilized a natural pathogen of mice, MHV, as a prototype to model betacoronavirus-induced acute lung injure and multiorgan involvement under biosafety level 2 conditions. We showed that C57BL/6J mice intranasally inoculated with MHV-3 develops severe disease, which includes acute lung damage and respiratory distress that precede systemic inflammation and death. Accordingly, the proposed animal model may provide a useful tool for studies regarding betacoronavirus respiratory infection and related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Degradation of WTAP blocks antiviral responses by reducing the m6A levels of IRF3 and IFNAR1 mRNA</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34467630/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) is a chemical modification present in multiple RNA species and is most abundant in mRNAs. Studies on m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A reveal its comprehensive roles in almost every aspect of mRNA metabolism, as well as in a variety of physiological processes. Although some recent discoveries indicate that m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A can affect the life cycles of numerous viruses as well as the cellular antiviral immune response, the roles of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification in type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling are still largely unknown. Here, we reveal that WT1-associated protein (WTAP), one of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A &amp;ldquo;writers&amp;rdquo;, is degraded via the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway upon activation of IFN-I signaling. With the degradation of WTAP, the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and interferon alpha/beta receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) mRNAs are reduced, leading to translational suppression of IRF3 and instability of IFNAR1 mRNA. Thus, the WTAP-IRF3/IFNAR1 axis may serve as negative feedback pathway to fine-tune the activation of IFN-I signaling, which highlights the roles of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A in the antiviral response by dictating the fate of mRNAs associated with IFN-I signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; HCV infection is a major risk factor that can lead to chronic liver disease, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. Progression of chronic liver disease by HCV infection is caused by a complex intercellular reaction. Especially, exosomes and microRNAs (miRNAs) from HCV-infected hepatocytes play a role in the pathogenesis of liver disease by facilitating cellular communication between parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells. However, the underlying mechanism of secretions of exosome and miRNAs during HCV infection is still open for study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we demonstrated a pathway for the release of exosome and exosomal miRNAs through caspase-3/pannexin 1 (Panx1)/P2X4 activation during HCV infection in hepatocytes. We found that HCV infection induced the stimulation of exosome release and activation of the caspase-3/Panx1/P2X4 pathway in Huh7.5.1 cells. In addition, miR-122 and miR-146a levels in extracellular exosomes from HCV-infected cells were dramatically increased whereas intracellular miR122 and miR-146a expression had no large changes. Notably, secretions of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs were decreased by inhibition of caspase 3, Panx1, and P2X4 whereas inhibition of ROCK-1 cleavage did not affect these during HCV infection in Huh7.5.1 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These results suggested that HCV infection caused secretions of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs dependent on the caspase 3/Panx1/P2X4 pathway. Our study provides a possible therapeutic intervention using Panx1 suppression for liver disease development mediated by exosomes from HCV-infected hepatocytes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>African Swine Fever Virus E120R Protein Inhibits Interferon Beta Production by Interacting with IRF3 To Block Its Activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34190598/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African swine fever is a devastating disease of swine caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). The pathogenesis of the disease remains largely unknown, leaving the spread of the disease uncontrolled in many countries and regions. Here, we identified E120R, a structural protein of ASFV, as a key virulence factor and late-phase-expressed protein of the virus. E120R revealed an activity to suppress the host antiviral response through blocking beta interferon (IFN-β) production, and the amino acids (aa) at sites 72 and 73 (amino acids 72-73) in the C-terminal domain were essential for this function. E120R interacted with interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and interfered with the recruitment of IRF3 to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which in turn suppressed IRF3 phosphorylation, decreasing interferon production. A recombinant mutant ASFV was further constructed to confirm the claimed mechanism. The ASFV lacking the complete E120R region could not be rescued, whereas the virus could tolerate the deletion of the 72nd and 73rd residues in E120R (ASFV E120R-Δ72-73aa). ASFV E120R with the two-amino-acid deletion failed to interact with IRF3 during ASFV E120R-Δ72-73aa infection, and the viral infection activated IRF3 phosphorylation highly and induced more robust type I interferon production than its parental ASFV. An unbiased transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression also confirmed that considerably more IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were detected in ASFV E120R-Δ72-73aa-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) than in wild-type ASFV-infected PAMs. Together, our findings have identified a novel mechanism evolved by ASFV to inhibit the host antiviral response, and they provide a new target for guiding the development of ASFV live-attenuated vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African swine fever is a highly contagious animal disease affecting the pig industry worldwide, which has brought enormous economic losses. Infection by the causative agent, African swine fever virus (ASFV), causes severe immunosuppression during viral infection, contributing to serious clinical manifestations. Therefore, identification of the viral proteins involved in immunosuppression is critical for ASFV vaccine design and development. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated that E120R protein, a structural protein of ASFV, played an important role in suppression of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and type I interferon production by binding to IRF3 and blocking the recruitment of IRF3 to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Deletion of the crucial binding sites in E120R critically increased the interferon response during ASFV infection. This study explored a novel antagonistic mechanism of ASFV, which is critical for guiding the development of ASFV live-attenuated vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HIF-1α promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection and aggravates inflammatory responses to COVID-19</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytokine storm induced by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major pathological feature of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a crucial determinant in COVID-19 prognosis. Understanding the mechanism underlying the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm is critical for COVID-19 control. Here, we identify that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and host hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) play key roles in the virus infection and pro-inflammatory responses. RNA sequencing shows that HIF-1α signaling, immune response, and metabolism pathways are dysregulated in COVID-19 patients. Clinical analyses indicate that HIF-1α production, inflammatory responses, and high mortalities occurr in elderly patients. HIF-1α and pro-inflammatory cytokines are elicited in patients and infected cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces mitochondrial damage and Mito-ROS production to promote HIF-1α expression, which subsequently facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokines production. Notably, HIF-1α also broadly promotes the infection of other viruses. Collectively, during SARS-CoV-2 infection, ORF3a induces HIF-1α, which in turn aggravates viral infection and inflammatory responses. Therefore, HIF-1α plays an important role in promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection and inducing pro-inflammatory responses to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MARCH8 inhibits influenza A virus infection by targeting viral M2 protein for ubiquitination-dependent degradation in lysosomes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34285233/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) proteins are E3 ligases that regulate the stability of various cellular membrane proteins. MARCH8 has been reported to inhibit the infection of HIV-1 and a few other viruses, thus plays an important role in host antiviral defense. However, the antiviral spectrum and the underlying mechanisms of MARCH8 are incompletely defined. Here, we demonstrate that MARCH8 profoundly inhibits influenza A virus (IAV) replication both in vitro and in mice. Mechanistically, MARCH8 suppresses IAV release through redirecting viral M2 protein from the plasma membrane to lysosomes for degradation. Specifically, MARCH8 catalyzes the K63-linked polyubiquitination of M2 at lysine residue 78 (K78). A recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus carrying the K78R M2 protein shows greater replication and more severe pathogenicity in cells and mice. More importantly, we found that the M2 protein of the H1N1 IAV has evolved to acquire non-lysine amino acids at positions 78/79 to resist MARCH8-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Together, our data support the important role of MARCH8 in host anti-IAV intrinsic immune defense by targeting M2, and suggest the inhibitory pressure of MARCH8 on H1N1 IAV transmission in the human population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective Zika vaccines engineered to eliminate enhancement of dengue infection via immunodominance switch</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34267374/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is an important safety concern for vaccine development against dengue virus (DENV) and its antigenically related Zika virus (ZIKV) because vaccine may prime deleterious antibodies to enhance natural infections. Cross-reactive antibodies targeting the conserved fusion loop epitope (FLE) are known as the main sources of ADE. We design ZIKV immunogens engineered to change the FLE conformation but preserve neutralizing epitopes. Single vaccination conferred sterilizing immunity against ZIKV without ADE of DENV-serotype 1-4 infections and abrogated maternal-neonatal transmission in mice. Unlike the wild-type-based vaccine inducing predominately cross-reactive ADE-prone antibodies, B cell profiling revealed that the engineered vaccines switched immunodominance to dispersed patterns without DENV enhancement. The crystal structure of the engineered immunogen showed the dimeric conformation of the envelope protein with FLE disruption. We provide vaccine candidates that will prevent both ZIKV infection and infection-/vaccination-induced DENV ADE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selective autophagy controls the stability of TBK1 via NEDD4 to balance host defense</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a core kinase of antiviral immunity, the activity and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is tightly controlled by multiple post-translational modifications. Although it has been demonstrated that TBK1 stability can be regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway, it is unclear whether another important protein degradation pathway, autophagosome pathway, can specifically affect TBK1 degradation by cargo receptors. Here we report that E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 functions as a negative regulator of type I interferon (IFN) signaling by targeting TBK1 for degradation at the late stage of viral infection, to prevent the host from excessive immune response. Mechanically NEDD4 catalyzes the K27-linked poly-ubiquitination of TBK1 at K344, which serves as a recognition signal for cargo receptor NDP52-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Taken together, our study reveals the regulatory role of NEDD4 in balancing TBK1-centered type I IFN activation and provides insights into the crosstalk between selective autophagy and antiviral signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global crisis and is more devastating than any other previous infectious disease. It has affected a significant proportion of the global population both physically and mentally, and destroyed businesses and societies. Current evidence suggested that immunopathology may be responsible for COVID-19 pathogenesis, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, dysregulation of monocytes and macrophages, reduced or delayed type I interferon (IFN-I) response, antibody-dependent enhancement, and especially, cytokine storm (CS). The CS is characterized by hyperproduction of an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines and is closely associated with poor prognosis. These excessively secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines initiate different inflammatory signaling pathways via their receptors on immune and tissue cells, resulting in complicated medical symptoms including fever, capillary leak syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure, ultimately leading to death in the most severe cases. Therefore, it is clinically important to understand the initiation and signaling pathways of CS to develop more effective treatment strategies for COVID-19. Herein, we discuss the latest developments in the immunopathological characteristics of COVID-19 and focus on CS including the current research status of the different cytokines involved. We also discuss the induction, function, downstream signaling, and existing and potential interventions for targeting these cytokines or related signal pathways. We believe that a comprehensive understanding of CS in COVID-19 will help to develop better strategies to effectively control immunopathology in this disease and other infectious and inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interplay between EBV infection and acquired genetic alterations during nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) development remains vague. Here we report a comprehensive genomic analysis of 70 NPCs, combining whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of microdissected tumor cells with EBV oncogene expression to reveal multiple aspects of cellular-viral co-operation in tumorigenesis. Genomic aberrations along with EBV-encoded LMP1 expression underpin constitutive NF-κB activation in 90% of NPCs. A similar spectrum of somatic aberrations and viral gene expression undermine innate immunity in 79% of cases and adaptive immunity in 47% of cases; mechanisms by which NPC may evade immune surveillance despite its pro-inflammatory phenotype. Additionally, genomic changes impairing TGFBR2 promote oncogenesis and stabilize EBV infection in tumor cells. Fine-mapping of CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletion breakpoints reveals homozygous MTAP deletions in 32-34% of NPCs that confer marked sensitivity to MAT2A inhibition. Our work concludes that NPC is a homogeneously NF-κB-driven and immune-protected, yet potentially druggable, cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nuclear pore complex is the sole gateway connecting the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. In humans, the nuclear pore complex is one of the largest multiprotein assemblies in the cell, with a molecular mass of ∼110 MDa and consisting of 8 to 64 copies of about 34 different nuclear pore proteins, termed nucleoporins, for a total of 1000 subunits per pore. Trafficking events across the nuclear pore are mediated by nuclear transport receptors and are highly regulated. The nuclear pore complex is also used by several RNA viruses and almost all DNA viruses to access the host cell nucleoplasm for replication. Viruses hijack the nuclear pore complex, and nuclear transport receptors, to access the nucleoplasm where they replicate. In addition, the nuclear pore complex is used by the cell innate immune system, a network of signal transduction pathways that coordinates the first response to foreign invaders, including viruses and other pathogens. Several branches of this response depend on dynamic signaling events that involve the nuclear translocation of downstream signal transducers. Mounting evidence has shown that these signaling cascades, especially those steps that involve nucleocytoplasmic trafficking events, are targeted by viruses so that they can evade the innate immune system. This review summarizes how nuclear pore proteins and nuclear transport receptors contribute to the innate immune response and highlights how viruses manipulate this cellular machinery to favor infection. A comprehensive understanding of nuclear pore proteins in antiviral innate immunity will likely contribute to the development of new antiviral therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Arginine monomethylation by PRMT7 controls MAVS-mediated antiviral innate immunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate control of innate immune responses is required to eliminate invading pathogens and simultaneously avoid autoinflammation and autoimmune diseases. Here, we demonstrate that arginine monomethylation precisely regulates the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated antiviral response. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) forms aggregates to catalyze MAVS monomethylation at arginine residue 52 (R52), attenuating its binding to TRIM31 and RIG-I, which leads to the suppression of MAVS aggregation and subsequent activation. Upon virus infection, aggregated PRMT7 is disabled in a timely manner due to automethylation at arginine residue 32 (R32), and SMURF1 is recruited to PRMT7 by MAVS to induce proteasomal degradation of PRMT7, resulting in the relief of PRMT7 suppression of MAVS activation. Therefore, we not only reveal that arginine monomethylation by PRMT7 negatively regulates MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling in vitro and in vivo but also uncover a mechanism by which PRMT7 is tightly controlled to ensure the timely activation of antiviral defense.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbiota plays a fundamental role in regulating host immunity. However, the processes involved in the initiation and regulation of immunity to the microbiota remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the skin microbiota promotes the discrete expression of defined endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Keratinocyte-intrinsic responses to ERVs depended on cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) signaling and promoted the induction of commensal-specific T cells. Inhibition of ERV reverse transcription significantly impacted these responses, resulting in impaired immunity to the microbiota and its associated tissue repair function. Conversely, a lipid-enriched diet primed the skin for heightened ERV- expression in response to commensal colonization, leading to increased immune responses and tissue inflammation. Together, our results support the idea that the host may have co-opted its endogenous virome as a means to communicate with the exogenous microbiota, resulting in a multi-kingdom dialog that controls both tissue homeostasis and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RNA-binding protein RBM47 stabilizes IFNAR1 mRNA to potentiate host antiviral activity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-α/β)-mediated immune response is the first line of host defense against invading viruses. IFN-α/β binds to IFN-α/β receptors (IFNARs) and triggers the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Thus, stabilization of IFNARs is important for prolonging antiviral activity. Here, we report the induction of an RNA-binding motif-containing protein, RBM47, upon viral infection or interferon stimulation. Using multiple virus infection models, we demonstrate that RBM47 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. RBM47 has no noticeable impact on IFN production, but significantly activates the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and enhances the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Mechanistically, RBM47 binds to the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR of IFNAR1 mRNA, increases mRNA stability, and retards the degradation of IFNAR1. In summary, this study suggests that RBM47 is an interferon-inducible RNA-binding protein that plays an essential role in enhancing host IFN downstream signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RUNX1-mediated alphaherpesvirus-host trans-species chromatin interaction promotes viral transcription</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most DNA viruses, herpesviruses precisely deliver their genomes into the sophisticatedly organized nuclei of the infected host cells to initiate subsequent transcription and replication. However, it remains elusive how the viral genome specifically interacts with the host genome and hijacks host transcription machinery. Using pseudorabies virus (PRV) as model virus, we performed chromosome conformation capture assays to demonstrate a genome-wide specific trans-species chromatin interaction between the virus and host. Our data show that the PRV genome is delivered by the host DNA binding protein RUNX1 into the open chromatin and active transcription zone. This facilitates virus hijacking host RNAPII to efficiently transcribe viral genes, which is significantly inhibited by either a RUNX1 inhibitor or RNA interference. Together, these findings provide insights into the chromatin interaction between viral and host genomes and identify new areas of research to advance the understanding of herpesvirus genome transcription.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DHX15 is required to control RNA virus-induced intestinal inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA helicases play critical roles in various biological processes, including serving as viral RNA sensors in innate immunity. Here, we find that RNA helicase DEAH-box helicase 15 (DHX15) is essential for type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-β), type III IFN (IFN-λ3), and inflammasome-derived cytokine IL-18 production by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in response to poly I:C and RNA viruses with preference of enteric RNA viruses, but not DNA virus. Importantly, we generate IEC-specific Dhx15-knockout mice and demonstrate that DHX15 is required for controlling intestinal inflammation induced by enteric RNA virus rotavirus in suckling mice and reovirus in adult mice in vivo, which owes to impaired IFN-β, IFN-λ3, and IL-18 production in IECs from Dhx15-deficient mice. Mechanistically, DHX15 interacts with NLRP6 to trigger NLRP6 inflammasome assembly and activation for inducing IL-18 secretion in IECs. Collectively, our report reveals critical roles for DHX15 in sensing enteric RNA viruses in IECs and controlling intestinal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Caspase-Dependent Cleavage of DDX21 Suppresses Host Innate Immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34125604/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEAD (Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu) box RNA helicases have been proven to contribute to antiviral innate immunity. The DDX21 RNA helicase was identified as a nuclear protein involved in rRNA processing and RNA unwinding. DDX21 was also proven to be the scaffold protein in the complex of DDX1-DDX21-DHX36, which senses double-strand RNA and initiates downstream innate immunity. Here, we identified that DDX21 undergoes caspase-dependent cleavage after virus infection and treatment with RNA/DNA ligands, especially for RNA virus and ligands. Caspase-3/6 cleaves DDX21 at D126 and promotes its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to virus infection. The cytoplasmic cleaved DDX21 negatively regulates the interferon beta (IFN-β) signaling pathway by suppressing the formation of the DDX1-DDX21-DHX36 complex. Thus, our data identify DDX21 as a regulator of immune balance and most importantly uncover a potential role of DDX21 cleavage in the innate immune response to virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate immunity serves as the first barrier against virus infection. DEAD (Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu) box RNA helicases, originally considered to be involved in RNA processing and RNA unwinding, have been shown to play an important role in antiviral innate immunity. The precise regulation of innate immunity is critical for the host because the aberrant production of cytokines leads to unexpected pathological consequences. Here, we identified that DDX21 was cleaved at D126 by virus infection and treatment with RNA/DNA ligands via the caspase-3/6-dependent pathway. The cytoplasmic cleaved DDX21 negatively regulates the IFN-β signaling pathway by suppressing the formation of the DDX1-DDX21-DHX36 complex. In sum, our data identify DDX21 as a regulator of immune balance and most importantly uncover a potential role of DDX21 cleavage in the innate immune response to virus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates immune evasion through down-regulating MHC-Ι</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic and has claimed over 2 million lives worldwide. Although the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have high homology, the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 differ significantly from those of SARS. How and whether SARS-CoV-2 evades (cellular) immune surveillance requires further elucidation. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to major histocompability complex class Ι (MHC-Ι) down-regulation both in vitro and in vivo. The viral protein encoded by open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2, which shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all viral proteins, directly interacts with MHC-Ι molecules and mediates their down-regulation. In ORF8-expressing cells, MHC-Ι molecules are selectively targeted for lysosomal degradation via autophagy. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are much less sensitive to lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Because ORF8 protein impairs the antigen presentation system, inhibition of ORF8 could be a strategy to improve immune surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19, uses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for the replication of its genome and the transcription of its genes. We found that the catalytic subunit of the RdRp, nsp12, ligates two iron-sulfur metal cofactors in sites that were modeled as zinc centers in the available cryo-electron microscopy structures of the RdRp complex. These metal binding sites are essential for replication and for interaction with the viral helicase. Oxidation of the clusters by the stable nitroxide TEMPOL caused their disassembly, potently inhibited the RdRp, and blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. These iron-sulfur clusters thus serve as cofactors for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and are targets for therapy of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunoevasins are viral proteins that prevent antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, thus evading host immune recognition. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) evades immune surveillance to induce chronic infection; however, how HCV-infected hepatocytes affect immune cells and evade immune recognition remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that HCV core protein functions as an immunoevasin. Its expression interfered with the maturation of MHC class I molecules catalyzed by the signal peptide peptidase (SPP) and induced their degradation via HMG-CoA reductase degradation 1 homolog, thereby impairing antigen presentation to CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. The expression of MHC class I in the livers of HCV core transgenic mice and chronic hepatitis C patients was impaired but was restored in patients achieving sustained virological response. Finally, we show that the human cytomegalovirus US2 protein, possessing a transmembrane region structurally similar to the HCV core protein, targets SPP to impair MHC class I molecule expression. Thus, SPP represents a potential target for the impairment of MHC class I molecules by DNA and RNA viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging life-threatening viruses have posed great challenges to public health. It is now increasingly clear that epigenetics plays a role in shaping host-virus interactions and there is a great need for a more thorough understanding of these intricate interactions through the epigenetic lens, which may represent potential therapeutic opportunities in the clinic. In this review, we highlight the current understanding of the roles of key epigenetic regulators - chromatin remodeling and histone modification - in modulating chromatin openness during host defense against virus. We also discuss how the RNA modification m6A (N6-methyladenosine) affects fundamental aspects of host-virus interactions. We conclude with future directions for uncovering more detailed functions that epigenetic regulation exerts on both host cells and viruses during infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the effects of antibodies against other spike protein domains are largely unknown. Here, we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) induced the open conformation of RBD and thus enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2 and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis revealed that all of the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the NTD. Structural analysis demonstrated that all infectivity-enhancing antibodies bound to NTD in a similar manner. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected at high levels in severe patients. Moreover, we identified antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site in uninfected donors, albeit at a lower frequency. These findings demonstrate that not only neutralizing antibodies but also enhancing antibodies are produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) triggers a potent response to detect pathogen infection and promote innate immune signaling. Whether and how pathogens manipulate cGAS-DNA condensation to mediate immune evasion is unknown. We report the identification of a structurally related viral tegument protein family, represented by ORF52 and VP22 from gamma- and alpha-herpesvirinae, respectively, that employs a conserved mechanism to restrict cGAS-DNA phase separation. ORF52/VP22 proteins accumulate into, and effectively disrupt, the pre-formed cGAS-DNA condensation both in vitro and in cells. The inhibition process is dependent on DNA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation of the viral protein rather than a direct interaction with cGAS. Moreover, highly abundant ORF52 proteins carried within viral particles are able to target cGAS-DNA phase separation in early infection stage. Our results define ORF52/VP22-type tegument proteins as a family of inhibitors targeting cGAS-DNA phase separation and demonstrate a mechanism for how viruses overcome innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies UFMylation and TRAMP-like complexes as host factors required for hepatitis A virus infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies host factors important for hepatitis A virus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UFMylation of the ribosomal protein RPL26 enhances viral translation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PAPD5/7-ZCCHC14 TRAMP-like complexes are important for hepatitis A virus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pharmacological inhibition of PAPD5/7 reduces hepatitis A virus replication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a positive-sense RNA virus causing acute inflammation of the liver. Here, using a genome-scale CRISPR screen, we provide a comprehensive picture of the cellular factors that are exploited by HAV. We identify genes involved in sialic acid/ganglioside biosynthesis and members of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor complex, corroborating their putative roles for HAV. Additionally, we uncover all components of the cellular machinery for UFMylation, a ubiquitin-like protein modification. We show that HAV translation specifically depends on UFM1 conjugation of the ribosomal protein RPL26. Furthermore, we find that components related to the yeast Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation (TRAMP) complex are required for viral translation independent of controlling viral poly(A) tails or RNA stability. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of the TRAMP-like complex decreases HAV replication in hepatocyte cells and human liver organoids, thus providing a strategy for host-directed therapy of HAV infection&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFI16 directly senses viral RNA and enhances RIG-I transcription and activation to restrict influenza virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33986530/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) receptor senses cytoplasmic viral RNA and activates type I interferons (IFN-I) and downstream antiviral immune responses. How RIG-I binds to viral RNA and how its activation is regulated remains unclear. Here, using IFI16 knockout cells and p204-deficient mice, we demonstrate that the DNA sensor IFI16 enhances IFN-I production to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) replication. IFI16 positively upregulates RIG-I transcription through direct binding to and recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the RIG-I promoter. IFI16 also binds to influenza viral RNA via its HINa domain and to RIG-I protein with its PYRIN domain, thus promoting IAV-induced K63-linked polyubiquitination and RIG-I activation. Our work demonstrates that IFI16 is a positive regulator of RIG-I signalling during influenza virus infection, highlighting its role in the RIG-I-like-receptor-mediated innate immune response to IAV and other RNA viruses, and suggesting its possible exploitation to modulate the antiviral response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 9 (PARP9) as a noncanonical sensor for RNA virus in dendritic cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33976210/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate immune cells are critical in protective immunity against viral infections, involved in sensing foreign viral nucleic acids. Here we report that the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 9 (PARP9), a member of PARP family, serves as a non-canonical sensor for RNA virus to initiate and amplify type I interferon (IFN) production. We find knockdown or deletion of PARP9 in human or mouse dendritic cells and macrophages inhibits type I IFN production in response to double strand RNA stimulation or RNA virus infection. Furthermore, mice deficient for PARP9 show enhanced susceptibility to infections with RNA viruses because of the impaired type I IFN production. Mechanistically, we show that PARP9 recognizes and binds viral RNA, with resultant recruitment and activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT3 pathway, independent of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS). PI3K/AKT3 then activates the IRF3 and IRF7 by phosphorylating IRF3 at Ser385 and IRF7 at Ser437/438 mediating type I IFN production. Together, we reveal a critical role for PARP9 as a non-canonical RNA sensor that depends on the PI3K/AKT3 pathway to produce type I IFN. These findings may have important clinical implications in controlling viral infections and viral-induced diseases by targeting PARP9.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Infection of humanized mice with a novel phlebovirus presented pathogenic features of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33974679/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a tick-borne emerging phlebovirus with high mortality rates of 6.0 to 30%. SFTSV infection is characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemorrhage and multiple organ failures. Currently, specific therapies and vaccines remain elusive. Suitable small animal models are urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenesis and evaluate the potential drug and vaccine for SFTSV infection. Previous models presented only mild or no pathogenesis of SFTS, limiting their applications in SFTSV infection. Therefore, it is an urgent need to develop a small animal model for the investigation of SFTSV pathogenesis and evaluation of therapeutics. In the current report, we developed a SFTSV infection model based on the HuPBL-NCG mice that recapitulates many pathological characteristics of SFTSV infection in humans. Virus-induced histopathological changes were identified in spleen, lung, kidney, and liver. SFTSV was colocalized with macrophages in the spleen and liver, suggesting that the macrophages in the spleen and liver could be the principle target cells of SFTSV. In addition, histological analysis showed that the vascular endothelium integrity was severely disrupted upon viral infection along with depletion of platelets. In vitro cellular assays further revealed that SFTSV infection increased the vascular permeability of endothelial cells by promoting tyrosine phosphorylation and internalization of the adhesion molecule vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, a critical component of endothelial integrity. In addition, we found that both virus infection and pathogen-induced exuberant cytokine release dramatically contributed to the vascular endothelial injury. We elucidated the pathogenic mechanisms of hemorrhage syndrome and developed a humanized mouse model for SFTSV infection, which should be helpful for anti-SFTSV therapy and pathogenesis study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A signaling pathway-driven bioinformatics pipeline for predicting therapeutics against emerging infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34868553/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), is a novel Betacoronavirus that was first reported in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. The virus has since caused a worldwide pandemic that highlights the need to quickly identify potential prophylactic or therapeutic treatments that can reduce the signs, symptoms, and/or spread of disease when dealing with a novel infectious agent. To combat this problem, we constructed a computational pipeline that uniquely combines existing tools to predict drugs and biologics that could be repurposed to combat an emerging pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Our workflow analyzes RNA-sequencing data to determine differentially expressed genes, enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and dysregulated pathways in infected cells, which can then be used to identify US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs that target human proteins within these pathways. We used this pipeline to perform a meta-analysis of RNA-seq data from cells infected with three Betacoronavirus species including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; MERS), and SARS-CoV-2, as well as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus to identify therapeutics that could be used to treat COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; This analysis identified twelve existing drugs, most of which already have FDA-approval, that are predicted to counter the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results were cross-referenced with interventional clinical trials and other studies in the literature to identify drugs on our list that had previously been identified or used as treatments for COIVD-19 including canakinumab, anakinra, tocilizumab, sarilumab, and baricitinib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; While the results reported here are specific to Betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, our bioinformatics pipeline can be used to quickly identify candidate therapeutics for future emerging infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblasts as immune regulators in infection, inflammation and cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chronic infection, inflammation and cancer, the tissue microenvironment controls how local immune cells behave, with tissue-resident fibroblasts emerging as a key cell type in regulating activation or suppression of an immune response. Fibroblasts are heterogeneous cells, encompassing functionally distinct populations, the phenotypes of which differ according to their tissue of origin and type of inciting disease. Their immunological properties are also diverse, ranging from the maintenance of a potent inflammatory environment in chronic inflammation to promoting immunosuppression in malignancy, and encapsulating and incarcerating infectious agents within tissues. In this Review, we compare the mechanisms by which fibroblasts control local immune responses, as well as the factors regulating their inflammatory and suppressive profiles, in different tissues and pathological settings. This cross-disease perspective highlights the importance of tissue context in determining fibroblast-immune cell interactions, as well as potential therapeutic avenues to exploit this knowledge for the benefit of patients with chronic infection, inflammation and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bacteria induce skin regeneration via IL-1β signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33798492/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germ-free mice have low skin regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skin commensal microbiome and even pathological S. aureus induce regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bacteria induce regeneration through IL1β-keratinocyte-dependent IL1R/Myd88 signaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commensal bacteria promote healing in humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental factors that enhance regeneration are largely unknown. The immune system and microbiome are attributed roles in repairing and regenerating structure but their precise interplay is unclear. Here, we assessed the function of skin bacteria in wound healing and wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN), a rare adult organogenesis model. WIHN levels and stem cell markers correlate with bacterial counts, being lowest in germ-free (GF), intermediate in conventional specific pathogen-free (SPF), and highest in wild-type mice, even those infected with pathogenic &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;. Reducing skin microbiota via cage changes or topical antibiotics decreased WIHN. Inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and keratinocyte-dependent IL-1R-MyD88 signaling are necessary and sufficient for bacteria to promote regeneration. Finally, in a small trial, a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic also slowed skin wound healing in adult volunteers. These results demonstrate a role for IL-1β to control morphogenesis and support the need to reconsider routine applications of topical prophylactic antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Serine metabolism antagonizes antiviral innate immunity by preventing ATP6V0d2-mediated YAP lysosomal degradation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serine metabolism promotes tumor oncogenesis and regulates immune cell functions, but whether it also contributes to antiviral innate immunity is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that virus-infected macrophages display decreased expression of serine synthesis pathway (SSP) enzymes. Suppressing the SSP key enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) by genetic approaches or by treatment with the pharmaceutical inhibitor CBR-5884 and by exogenous serine restriction enhanced IFN-β-mediated antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic experiments showed that virus infection or serine metabolism deficiency increased the expression of the V-ATPase subunit ATP6V0d2 by inhibiting S-adenosyl methionine-dependent H3K27me3 occupancy at the promoter. ATP6V0d2 promoted YAP lysosomal degradation to relieve YAP-mediated blockade of the TBK1-IRF3 axis and, thus, enhance IFN-β production. These findings implicate critical functions of PHGDH and the key immunometabolite serine in blunting antiviral innate immunity and also suggest manipulation of serine metabolism as a therapeutic strategy against virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the current global pandemic of COVID-19; this virus infects multiple organs, such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. The microbiome in these organs, including the bacteriome and virome, responds to infection and might also influence disease progression and treatment outcome. In a cohort of 13 COVID-19 patients in Beijing, China, we observed that the gut virome and bacteriome in the COVID-19 patients were notably different from those of five healthy controls. We identified a bacterial dysbiosis signature by observing reduced diversity and viral shifts in patients, and among the patients, the bacterial/viral compositions were different between patients of different severities, although these differences are not entirely distinguishable from the effect of antibiotics. Severe cases of COVID-19 exhibited a greater abundance of opportunistic pathogens but were depleted for butyrate-producing groups of bacteria compared with mild to moderate cases. We replicated our findings in a mouse COVID-19 model, confirmed virome differences and bacteriome dysbiosis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and observed that immune/infection-related genes were differentially expressed in gut epithelial cells during infection, possibly explaining the virome and bacteriome dynamics. Our results suggest that the components of the microbiome, including the bacteriome and virome, are affected by SARS-CoV-2 infections, while their compositional signatures could reflect or even contribute to disease severity and recovery processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heparin prevents caspase-11-dependent septic lethality independent of anticoagulant properties</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heparin, a mammalian polysaccharide, is a widely used anticoagulant medicine to treat thrombotic disorders. It is also known to improve outcomes in sepsis, a leading cause of mortality resulted from infection-induced immune dysfunction. Whereas it is relatively clear how heparin exerts its anticoagulant effect, the immunomodulatory mechanisms enabled by heparin remain enigmatic. Here, we show that heparin prevented caspase-11-dependent immune responses and lethality in sepsis independent of its anticoagulant properties. Heparin or a chemically modified form of heparin without anticoagulant function inhibited the alarmin HMGB1-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interaction and prevented the macrophage glycocalyx degradation by heparanase. These events blocked the cytosolic delivery of LPS in macrophages and the activation of caspase-11, a cytosolic LPS receptor that mediates lethality in sepsis. Survival was higher in septic patients treated with heparin than those without heparin treatment. The identification of this previously unrecognized heparin function establishes a link between innate immune responses and coagulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membrane-associated RING (really interesting new gene)-cysteine-histidine (CH) (MARCH) ubiquitin ligases belong to a RING finger domain E3 ligases family. So far, eleven members have been found in the MARCH family, which are MARCH 1 to 11. The members of the MARCH family are widely distributed and involve in a variety of cellular functions, including regulation of the immune system, transmembrane transport of proteins, protein stability, endoplasmic reticulum-related degradation, and endosome protein transport. Several seminal studies over the past decade have delineated that MARCH affects viral replication through various mechanisms by regulating the activity of signaling molecules and their expression in the antiviral innate immune responses. Here, we summarize the complex roles of MARCH ligases in the antiviral innate immune signaling pathway and its impact on viral replication in host immune defense systems. A better understanding of this interplay&amp;rsquo;s molecular mechanisms is important concerning the development of new therapeutics targeting viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decreased Expression of the Host Long-Noncoding RNA-GM Facilitates Viral Escape by Inhibiting the Kinase activity TBK1 via S-glutathionylation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade elimination by the immune system. Here we examined the contribution of host long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in viral immune evasion. By functional screening of lncRNAs whose expression decreased upon viral infection of macrophages, we identified a lncRNA (lncRNA-GM, Gene Symbol: AK189470.1) that promoted type I interferon (IFN-I) production and inhibited viral replication. Deficiency of lncRNA-GM in mice increased susceptibility to viral infection and impaired IFN-I production. Mechanistically, lncRNA-GM bound to glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and blocked GSTM1 interaction with the kinase TBK1, reducing GSTM1-mediated S-glutathionylation of TBK1. Decreased S-glutathionylation enhanced TBK1 activity and downstream production of antiviral mediators. Viral infection reprogrammed intracellular glutathione metabolism and furthermore, an oxidized glutathione mimetic could inhibit TBK1 activity and promote viral replication. Our findings reveal regulation of TBK1 by S-glutathionylation and provide insight into the viral mediated metabolic changes that impact innate immunity and viral evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Complement and tissue factor-enriched neutrophil extracellular traps are key drivers in COVID-19 immunothrombosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32759504/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging data indicate that complement and neutrophils contribute to the maladaptive immune response that fuels hyperinflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy, thereby increasing coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) mortality. Here, we investigated how complement interacts with the platelet/neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)/thrombin axis, using COVID-19 specimens, cell-based inhibition studies, and NET/human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) cocultures. Increased plasma levels of NETs, tissue factor (TF) activity, and sC5b-9 were detected in patients. Neutrophils of patients yielded high TF expression and released NETs carrying active TF. Treatment of control neutrophils with COVID-19 platelet-rich plasma generated TF-bearing NETs that induced thrombotic activity of HAECs. Thrombin or NETosis inhibition or C5aR1 blockade attenuated platelet-mediated NET-driven thrombogenicity. COVID-19 serum induced complement activation in vitro, consistent with high complement activity in clinical samples. Complement C3 inhibition with compstatin Cp40 disrupted TF expression in neutrophils. In conclusion, we provide a mechanistic basis for a pivotal role of complement and NETs in COVID-19 immunothrombosis. This study supports strategies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that exploit complement or NETosis inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selective usage of ANP32 proteins by influenza B virus polymerase: Implications in determination of host range</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33045004/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influenza B virus (IBV) causes seasonal influenza and has accounted for an increasing proportion of influenza outbreaks. IBV mainly causes human infections and has not been found to spread in poultry. The replication mechanism and the determinants of interspecies transmission of IBV are largely unknown. In this study, we found that the host ANP32 proteins are required for the function of the IBV polymerase. Human ANP32A/B strongly supports IBV replication, while ANP32E has a limited role. Unlike human ANP32A/B, chicken ANP32A has low support activity to IBV polymerase because of a unique 33-amino-acid insert, which, in contrast, exhibits species specific support to avian influenza A virus (IAV) replication. Chicken ANP32B and ANP32E have even lower activity compared with human ANP32B/E due to specific amino acid substitutions at sites 129-130. We further revealed that the sites 129-130 affect the binding ability of ANP32B/E to IBV polymerase, while the 33-amino-acid insert of chicken ANP32A reduces its binding stability and affinity. Taken together, the features of avian ANP32 proteins limited their abilities to support IBV polymerase, which could prevent efficient replication of IBV in chicken cells. Our results illustrate roles of ANP32 proteins in supporting IBV replication and may help to understand the ineffective replication of IBV in birds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TREML4 receptor regulates inflammation and innate immune cell death during polymicrobial sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33020659/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a biphasic disease characterized by an acute inflammatory response, followed by a prolonged immunosuppressive phase. Therapies aimed at controlling inflammation help to reduce the time patients with sepsis spend in intensive care units, but they do not lead to a reduction in overall mortality. Recently, the focus has been on addressing the immunosuppressive phase, often caused by apoptosis of immune cells. However, molecular triggers of these events are not yet known. Using whole-genome CRISPR screening in mice, we identified a triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) family receptor, TREML4, as a key regulator of inflammation and immune cell death in sepsis. Genetic ablation of Treml4 in mice demonstrated that TREML4 regulates calcium homeostasis, the inflammatory cytokine response, myeloperoxidase activation, the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and apoptotic cell death in innate immune cells, leading to an overall increase in survival rate, both during the acute and chronic phases of polymicrobial sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA Malat1 inhibition of TDP43 cleavage suppresses IRF3-initiated antiviral innate immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32907941/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in the regulation of antiviral innate immune responses need to be further identified. By functionally screening the lncRNAs in macrophages, here we identified lncRNA &lt;em&gt;Malat1&lt;/em&gt;, abundant in the nucleus but significantly down-regulated after viral infection, as a negative regulator of antiviral type I IFN (IFN-I) production. &lt;em&gt;Malat1&lt;/em&gt; directly bound to the transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP43) in the nucleus and prevented activation of TDP43 by blocking the activated caspase-3-mediated TDP43 cleavage to TDP35. The cleaved TDP35 increased the nuclear IRF3 protein level by binding and degrading &lt;em&gt;Rbck1&lt;/em&gt; pre-mRNA to prevent IRF3 proteasomal degradation upon viral infection, thus selectively promoting antiviral IFN-I production. Deficiency of &lt;em&gt;Malat1&lt;/em&gt; enhanced antiviral innate responses in vivo, accompanying the increased IFN-I production and reduced viral burden. Importantly, the reduced &lt;em&gt;MALAT1&lt;/em&gt;, augmented IRF3, and increased &lt;em&gt;IFNA&lt;/em&gt; mRNA were found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Therefore, the down-regulation of &lt;em&gt;MALAT1&lt;/em&gt; in virus-infected cells or in human cells from autoimmune diseases will increase host resistance against viral infection or lead to autoinflammatory interferonopathies via the increased type I IFN production. Our results demonstrate that the nuclear &lt;em&gt;Malat1&lt;/em&gt; suppresses antiviral innate responses by targeting TDP43 activation via RNA-RBP interactive network, adding insight to the molecular regulation of innate responses and autoimmune pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LncRNAs have been identified as regulating antiviral innate responses via different targets through various ways. Whether there is an abundant and highly conserved lncRNA in the nucleus which may regulate antiviral innate signaling through a new mechanism remains to be investigated. Here, we identify that viral infection-reduced expression of &lt;em&gt;Malat1&lt;/em&gt; feedback promotes IRF3-initiated type I IFN production in the innate response against viral infection. &lt;em&gt;Malat1&lt;/em&gt; binds to TDP43 and prevents its cleavage mediated by activated caspase-3. The cleaved TDP35 inhibits IRF3 degradation through promoting the degradation of pre-mRNA of Rbck1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting IRF3. Aberrant &lt;em&gt;MALAT1&lt;/em&gt; reduction and IRF3 activation are found in SLE patients, providing one mechanistic explanation for why SLE patients always have type I interferonopathies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation and evasion of type I interferon responses by SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32733001/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pandemic of COVID-19 has posed an unprecedented threat to global public health. However, the interplay between the viral pathogen of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and host innate immunity is poorly understood. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 induces overt but delayed type-I interferon (IFN) responses. By screening 23 viral proteins, we find that SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, NSP3, NSP12, NSP13, NSP14, ORF3, ORF6 and M protein inhibit Sendai virus-induced IFN-β promoter activation, whereas NSP2 and S protein exert opposite effects. Further analyses suggest that ORF6 inhibits both type I IFN production and downstream signaling, and that the C-terminus region of ORF6 is critical for its antagonistic effect. Finally, we find that IFN-β treatment effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication. In summary, our study shows that SARS-CoV-2 perturbs host innate immune response via both its structural and nonstructural proteins, and thus provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TRIM24 facilitates antiviral immunity through mediating K63-linked TRAF3 ubiquitination</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32324863/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitination is an essential mechanism in the control of antiviral immunity upon virus infection. Here, we identify a series of ubiquitination-modulating enzymes that are modulated by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Notably, TRIM24 is down-regulated through direct transcriptional suppression induced by VSV-activated IRF3. Reducing or ablating TRIM24 compromises type I IFN (IFN-I) induction upon RNA virus infection and thus renders mice more sensitive to VSV infection. Mechanistically, VSV infection induces abundant TRIM24 translocation to mitochondria, where TRIM24 binds with TRAF3 and directly mediates K63-linked TRAF3 ubiquitination at K429/K436. This modification of TRAF3 enables its association with MAVS and TBK1, which consequently activates downstream antiviral signaling. Together, these findings establish TRIM24 as a critical positive regulator in controlling the activation of antiviral signaling and describe a previously unknown mechanism of TRIM24 function.The predicted 80 open reading frames (ORFs) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) have been intensively studied for decades. Here, we unravel the complete viral transcriptome and translatome during lytic infection with base-pair resolution by computational integration of multi-omics data. We identify a total of 201 transcripts and 284 ORFs including all known and 46 novel large ORFs. This includes a so far unknown ORF in the locus deleted in the FDA-approved oncolytic virus Imlygic. Multiple transcript isoforms expressed from individual gene loci explain translation of the vast majority of ORFs as well as N-terminal extensions (NTEs) and truncations. We show that NTEs with non-canonical start codons govern the subcellular protein localization and packaging of key viral regulators and structural proteins. We extend the current nomenclature to include all viral gene products and provide a genome browser that visualizes all the obtained data from whole genome to single-nucleotide resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel selective autophagy receptor, CCDC50, delivers K63 polyubiquitination-activated RIG-I/MDA5 for degradation during viral infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is a conserved process that delivers cytosolic substances to the lysosome for degradation, but its direct role in the regulation of antiviral innate immunity remains poorly understood. Here, through high-throughput screening, we discovered that CCDC50 functions as a previously unknown autophagy receptor that negatively regulates the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway initiated by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), the sensors for RNA viruses. The expression of CCDC50 is enhanced by viral infection, and CCDC50 specifically recognizes K63-polyubiquitinated RLRs, thus delivering the activated RIG-I/MDA5 for autophagic degradation. The association of CCDC50 with phagophore membrane protein LC3 is confirmed by crystal structure analysis. In contrast to other known autophagic cargo receptors that associate with either the LIR-docking site (LDS) or the UIM-docking site (UDS) of LC3, CCDC50 can bind to both LDS and UDS, representing a new type of cargo receptor. In mouse models with RNA virus infection, CCDC50 deficiency reduces the autophagic degradation of RIG-I/MDA5 and promotes type I IFN responses, resulting in enhanced viral resistance and improved survival rates. These results reveal a new link between autophagy and antiviral innate immune responses and provide additional insights into the regulatory mechanisms of RLR-mediated antiviral signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human herpesviruses 6A and 6B (HHV-6A and HHV-6B, respectively) are two virus species in the betaherpesvirus subfamily that exhibit T cell tropism. CD46 and CD134 are the cellular receptors for HHV-6A and HHV-6B, respectively. Interestingly, the efficiency of HHV-6A/6B entry is different among different types of target cells despite similar receptor expression levels on these cells. Here, we found that the cellular factor gp96 (also known as glucose-regulated protein 94, GRP94) is expressed on the cell surface and interacts with viral glycoprotein Q1 (gQ1) during virus entry. gp96 cell surface expression levels are associated with the efficiency of HHV-6A and HHV-6B entry into target cells. Both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments indicated that gp96 plays an important role in HHV-6 infection. Our findings provide new insight into the HHV-6 entry process and might suggest novel therapeutic targets for HHV-6 infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although new clinical importance has been revealed for human herpesviruses 6A (HHV-6A) and 6B, much is still unknown about the life cycles of these viruses in target cells. We identified a novel cellular factor, gp96, that is critical for both HHV-6A and -6B entry into host cells. As gp96 can function as an adjuvant in vaccine development for both infectious agents and cancers, it can be a potential therapeutic target for infection by these two viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>hnRNPA2B1 Associated with Recruitment of RNA into Exosomes Plays a Key Role in Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Release from Infected Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32295924/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hnRNPA2B1, an abundant cellular protein, has been reported to recruit RNAs bearing a specific sequence (EXO motif) into exosomes. We characterized an exosome population averaging 100 ± 50 nm in diameter and containing a defined set of constitutive exosome markers. This population packages microRNAs (miRNAs) and can be directed to block targeted gene expression in a dose-dependent fashion. The objective of this study was to characterize the role of hnRNPA2B1 in the recruitment of miRNA. We report the following four key findings. (i) hnRNPA2B1 is not a component of exosomes produced in HEp-2 or HEK293T cells. Hence, hnRNPA2B1 carries its cargo, at most, to the site of exosome assembly, but it is not itself incorporated into exosomes. (ii) The accumulation of exosomes produced by cells in which the gene encoding hnRNPA2B1 has been knocked out (ΔhnRNPA2B1 cells) was reduced 3-fold. (iii) In uninfected HEp-2 cells, hnRNPA2B1 is localized in the nucleus. In cells infected with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), hnRNPA2B1 was quantitatively exported to the cytoplasm and at least a fraction of hnRNPA2B1 colocalized with a Golgi marker. (iv) Lastly, in ΔhnRNPA2B1 cells, there was a 2- to 3-fold reduction in virus yield but a significant (&amp;gt;10-fold) reduction in HSV-1 released through the apical surface into the extracellular environment. The absence of hnRNPA2B1 had no significant impact on the basolateral export of HSV-1 from infected to uninfected cells by direct cell-to-cell contact. The results suggest that hnRNPA2B1 plays a key role in the transport of enveloped virus from its site of assembly to the extracellular environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this report, we show that hnRNPA2B1 is not a component of exosomes produced in HEp-2 or HEK293T cells. In herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-infected cells, hnRNPA2B1 was quantitatively translocated from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. In infected ΔhnRNPA2B1 cells, Golgi-dependent transport of virus from the apical surface to the extracellular medium was significantly reduced. In essence, this report supports the hypothesis that hnRNPA2B1 plays a key role in the egress of exosomes and HSV-1 from infected cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is an essential sensor of cytosolic DNA and critically mediates innate immune responses and autoimmunity. Modulating the activity and stability of cGAS provides potential strategies for treating viral or autoimmune diseases. Here, we report that ubiquitin-specific protease 29 (USP29) deubiquitinates and stabilizes cGAS and promotes cellular antiviral responses and autoimmunity. Knockdown or knockout of USP29 severely impairs Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)- or cytosolic DNA-induced expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. Consistently, Usp29m/m mice produce decreased type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines after HSV-1 infection and are hypersensitive to HSV-1 infection compared to the wild-type littermates. In addition, genetic ablation of USP29 in Trex1-/- mice eliminated the detectable pathological and molecular autoimmune phenotypes. Mechanistically, USP29 constitutively interacts with cGAS, deconjugates K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from cGAS and stabilizes cGAS in uninfected cells or after HSV-1 infection. Reconstitution of cGAS into Usp29-/- cells fully rescues type I IFN induction and cellular antiviral responses after HSV-1 infection. Our findings thus reveal a critical role of USP29 in the innate antiviral responses against DNA viruses and autoimmune diseases and provide insight into the regulation of cGAS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery of Widespread Host Protein Interactions with the Pre-replicated Genome of CHIKV Using VIR-CLASP</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary interactions between incoming viral RNA genomes and host proteins are crucial to infection and immunity. Until now, the ability to study these events was lacking. We developed viral cross-linking and solid-phase purification (VIR-CLASP) to characterize the earliest interactions between viral RNA and cellular proteins. We investigated the infection of human cells using Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and influenza A virus and identified hundreds of direct RNA-protein interactions. Here, we explore the biological impact of three protein classes that bind CHIKV RNA within minutes of infection. We find CHIKV RNA binds and hijacks the lipid-modifying enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) for pro-viral activity. We show that CHIKV genomes are N6-methyladenosine modified, and YTHDF1 binds and suppresses CHIKV replication. Finally, we find that the innate immune DNA sensor IFI16 associates with CHIKV RNA, reducing viral replication and maturation. Our findings have direct applicability to the investigation of potentially all RNA viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influenza infection elicits an expansion of gut population of endogenous Bifidobacterium animalis which protects mice against infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32345342/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Influenza is a severe respiratory illness that continually threatens global health. It has been widely known that gut microbiota modulates the host response to protect against influenza infection, but mechanistic details remain largely unknown. Here, we took advantage of the phenomenon of lethal dose 50 (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and metagenomic sequencing analysis to identify specific anti-influenza gut microbes and analyze the underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Transferring fecal microbes from mice that survive virulent influenza H7N9 infection into antibiotic-treated mice confers resistance to infection. Some gut microbes exhibit differential features to lethal influenza infection depending on the infection outcome. Bifidobacterium pseudolongum and Bifidobacterium animalis levels are significantly elevated in surviving mice when compared to dead or mock-infected mice. Oral administration of B. animalis alone or the combination of both significantly reduces the severity of H7N9 infection in both antibiotic-treated and germ-free mice. Functional metagenomic analysis suggests that B. animalis mediates the anti-influenza effect via several specific metabolic molecules. In vivo tests confirm valine and coenzyme A produce an anti-influenza effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings show that the severity of influenza infection is closely related to the heterogeneous responses of the gut microbiota. We demonstrate the anti-influenza effect of B. animalis, and also find that the gut population of endogenous B. animalis can expand to enhance host influenza resistance when lethal influenza infection occurs, representing a novel interaction between host and gut microbiota. Further, our data suggest the potential utility of Bifidobacterium in the prevention and as a prognostic predictor of influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interaction Between the Microbiota, Epithelia, and Immune Cells in the Intestine</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/32340570/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gastrointestinal tract harbors numerous commensal bacteria, referred to as the microbiota, that benefit host health by digesting dietary components and eliminating pathogens. The intestinal microbiota maintains epithelial barrier integrity and shapes the mucosal immune system, balancing host defense and oral tolerance with microbial metabolites, components, and attachment to host cells. To avoid aberrant immune responses, epithelial cells segregate the intestinal microbiota from immune cells by constructing chemical and physical barriers, leading to the establishment of host-commensal mutualism. Furthermore, intestinal immune cells participate in the maintenance of a healthy microbiota community and reinforce epithelial barrier functions. Perturbations of the microbiota composition are commonly observed in patients with autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory disorders. An understanding of the intimate interactions between the intestinal microbiota, epithelial cells, and immune cells that are crucial for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis might promote advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>O-GlcNAc transferase promotes influenza A virus-induced cytokine storm by targeting interferon regulatory factor-5</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32494619/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we demonstrated an essential function of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP)-associated O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) signaling in influenza A virus (IAV)-induced cytokine storm. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), a key enzyme for protein O-GlcNAcylation, mediated IAV-induced cytokine production. Upon investigating the mechanisms driving this event, we determined that IAV induced OGT to bind to interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF5), leading to O-GlcNAcylation of IRF5 on serine-430. O-GlcNAcylation of IRF5 is required for K63-linked ubiquitination of IRF5 and subsequent cytokine production. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that IRF5 is O-GlcNAcylated, and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines correlated with higher levels of blood glucose in IAV-infected patients. We identified a molecular mechanism by which HBP-mediated O-GlcNAcylation regulates IRF5 function during IAV infection, highlighting the importance of glucose metabolism in IAV-induced cytokine storm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ZFYVE1 negatively regulates MDA5- but not RIG-I-mediated innate antiviral response</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32251420/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), including RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), sense cytoplasmic viral RNA and initiate innate antiviral responses. How RIG-I and MDA5 are differentially regulated remains enigmatic. In this study, we identified the guanylate-binding protein (GBP) and zinc-finger FYVE domain-containing protein ZFYVE1 as a negative regulator of MDA5- but not RIG-I-mediated innate antiviral responses. ZFYVE1-deficiency promoted MDA5- but not RIG-I-mediated transcription of downstream antiviral genes. Comparing to wild-type mice, &lt;em&gt;Zfyve1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice were significantly protected from lethality induced by encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) that is sensed by MDA5, whereas &lt;em&gt;Zfyve1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Zfyve1&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice were comparable to death induced by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that is sensed by RIG-I. Mechanistically, ZFYVE1 interacted with MDA5 but not RIG-I. ZFYVE1 bound to viral RNA and decreased the ligand binding and oligomerization of MDA5. These findings suggest that ZFYVE1 acts as a specific negative regulator of MDA5-mediated innate immune responses by inhibiting its ligand binding and oligomerization.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of type 1 interferons in coagulation induced by gram-negative bacteria</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32016282/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infection not only stimulates innate immune responses but also activates coagulation cascades. Overactivation of the coagulation system in bacterial sepsis leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a life-threatening condition. However, the mechanisms by which bacterial infection activates the coagulation cascade are not fully understood. Here we show that type 1 interferons (IFNs), a widely expressed family of cytokines that orchestrate innate antiviral and antibacterial immunity, mediate bacterial infection-induced DIC by amplifying the release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) into the bloodstream. Inhibition of the expression of type 1 IFNs and disruption of their receptor IFN-α/βR or downstream effector (eg, HMGB1) uniformly decreased gram-negative bacteria-induced DIC. Mechanistically, extracellular HMGB1 markedly increased the procoagulant activity of tissue factor by promoting the externalization of phosphatidylserine to the outer cell surface, where phosphatidylserine assembles a complex of cofactor-proteases of the coagulation cascades. These findings not only provide novel insights into the link between innate immune responses and coagulation, but they also open a new avenue for developing novel therapeutic strategies to prevent DIC in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromatin dynamics regulated by epigenetic modification is crucial in genome stability and gene expression. Various epigenetic mechanisms have been identified in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Here, we examined the effects of ten epigenetic agents on pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection by using GFP-reporter assays. Inhibitors of bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4), which receives much more attention in cancer than viral infection, was found to exhibit substantial anti-viral activity against PRV as well as a range of DNA and RNA viruses. We further demonstrated that BRD4 inhibition boosted a robust innate immune response. BRD4 inhibition also de-compacted chromatin structure and induced the DNA damage response, thereby triggering the activation of cGAS-mediated innate immunity and increasing host resistance to viral infection both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effect of BRD4 inhibition on viral infection was mainly attributed to the attenuation of viral attachment. Our findings reveal a unique mechanism through which BRD4 inhibition restrains viral infection and points to its potent therapeutic value for viral infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current knowledge about nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) is largely derived from viral isolates that are co-cultivated with protists and algae. Here we reconstructed 2,074 NCLDV genomes from sampling sites across the globe by building on the rapidly increasing amount of publicly available metagenome data. This led to an 11-fold increase in phylogenetic diversity and a parallel 10-fold expansion in functional diversity. Analysis of 58,023 major capsid proteins from large and giant viruses using metagenomic data revealed the global distribution patterns and cosmopolitan nature of these viruses. The discovered viral genomes encoded a wide range of proteins with putative roles in photosynthesis and diverse substrate transport processes, indicating that host reprogramming is probably a common strategy in the NCLDVs. Furthermore, inferences of horizontal gene transfer connected viral lineages to diverse eukaryotic hosts. We anticipate that the global diversity of NCLDVs that we describe here will establish giant viruses-which are associated with most major eukaryotic lineages-as important players in ecosystems across Earth&amp;rsquo;s biomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>lncRNA Sensing of a Viral Suppressor of RNAi Activates Non-canonical Innate Immune Signaling in Drosophila</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiviral immunity in insects is mediated by the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Viruses evade antiviral RNAi by expressing virulence factors known as viral suppressors of RNAi (VSR). Here, we report the identification of VINR, a Drosophila VSR-interacting long non-coding (lnc) RNA that activates non-canonical innate immune signaling upon detection of the dsRNA-binding VSR of Drosophila C virus (DCV). VINR is required for the induction of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes but dispensable for antiviral RNAi. VINR functions by preventing the ubiquitin proteasome-dependent degradation of Cactin, a coiled-coil and arginine-serine-rich domain-containing protein that regulates a non-cannonical antimicrobial pathway for AMP induction. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of VINR in Drosophila cells enhances DCV replication independently of antiviral RNAi, and VINR-knockout adult flies exhibit enhanced disease susceptibility to DCV and bacteria. Our findings reveal a counter counter-defense strategy activated by a lncRNA in response to the viral suppression of the primary antiviral RNAi immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bacterial Endotoxin Activates the Coagulation Cascade through Gasdermin D-Dependent Phosphatidylserine Exposure</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31836429/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deletion of caspase-11 prevents disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in sepsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deletion of GSDMD prevents caspase-11- and TF-mediated DIC in endotoxemia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GSDMD deficiency inhibits endotoxin-induced TF activation by reducing PS exposure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of GSDMD by caspase-11 triggers Ca2+-dependent PS exposure through TMEM16F&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive activation of the coagulation system leads to life-threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Here, we examined the mechanisms underlying the activation of coagulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major cell-wall component of Gram-negative bacteria. We found that caspase-11, a cytosolic LPS receptor, activated the coagulation cascade. Caspase-11 enhanced the activation of tissue factor (TF), an initiator of coagulation, through triggering the formation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores and subsequent phosphatidylserine exposure, in a manner independent of cell death. GSDMD pores mediated calcium influx, which induced phosphatidylserine exposure through transmembrane protein 16F, a calcium-dependent phospholipid scramblase. Deletion of &lt;em&gt;Casp11&lt;/em&gt;, ablation of &lt;em&gt;Gsdmd&lt;/em&gt;, or neutralization of phosphatidylserine or TF prevented LPS-induced DIC. In septic patients, plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1β, biomarkers of GSDMD activation, correlated with phosphatidylserine exposure in peripheral leukocytes and DIC scores. Our findings mechanistically link immune recognition of LPS to coagulation, with implications for the treatment of DIC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infection-associated morbidity and mortality are a key global health care concern, necessitating the identification of new therapies capable of reducing the severity of IAV infections. In this study, we show that the consumption of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet (KD) protects mice from lethal IAV infection and disease. KD feeding resulted in an expansion of γδ T cells in the lung that improved barrier functions, thereby enhancing antiviral resistance. Expansion of these protective γδ T cells required metabolic adaptation to a ketogenic diet because neither feeding mice a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet nor providing chemical ketone body substrate that bypasses hepatic ketogenesis protected against infection. Therefore, KD-mediated immune-metabolic integration represents a viable avenue toward preventing or alleviating influenza disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enterovirus pathogenesis requires the host methyltransferase SETD3</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31527793/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enteroviruses (EVs) comprise a large genus of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses whose members cause a number of important and widespread human diseases, including poliomyelitis, myocarditis, acute flaccid myelitis and the common cold. How EVs co-opt cellular functions to promote replication and spread is incompletely understood. Here, using genome-scale CRISPR screens, we identify the actin histidine methyltransferase SET domain containing 3 (SETD3) as critically important for viral infection by a broad panel of EVs, including rhinoviruses and non-polio EVs increasingly linked to severe neurological disease such as acute flaccid myelitis (EV-D68) and viral encephalitis (EV-A71). We show that cytosolic SETD3, independent of its methylation activity, is required for the RNA replication step in the viral life cycle. Using quantitative affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we show that SETD3 specifically interacts with the viral 2A protease of multiple enteroviral species, and we map the residues in 2A that mediate this interaction. 2A mutants that retain protease activity but are unable to interact with SETD3 are severely compromised in RNA replication. These data suggest a role of the viral 2A protein in RNA replication beyond facilitating proteolytic cleavage. Finally, we show that SETD3 is essential for in vivo replication and pathogenesis in multiple mouse models for EV infection, including CV-A10, EV-A71 and EV-D68. Our results reveal a crucial role of a host protein in viral pathogenesis, and suggest targeting SETD3 as a potential mechanism for controlling viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protection against influenza infection requires early recognition by inflammatory dendritic cells through C-type lectin receptor SIGN-R1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31358982/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early phase of influenza infection occurs in the upper respiratory tract and the trachea, but little is known about the initial events of virus recognition and control of viral dissemination by the immune system. Here, we report that inflammatory dendritic cells (IDCs) are recruited to the trachea shortly after influenza infection through type I interferon-mediated production of the chemokine CCL2. We further show that recruited IDCs express the C-type lectin receptor SIGN-R1, which mediates direct recognition of the virus by interacting with N-linked glycans present in glycoproteins of the virion envelope. Activation of IDCs via SIGN-R1 triggers the production of the chemokines CCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10, which initiate the recruitment of protective natural killer (NK) cells in the infected trachea. In the absence of SIGN-R1, the recruitment and activation of NK cells is impaired, leading to uncontrolled viral proliferation. In sum, our results provide insight into the orchestration of the early cellular and molecular events involved in immune protection against influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-Cell Virus Sequencing of Influenza Infections That Trigger Innate Immunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza virus-infected cells vary widely in their expression of viral genes and only occasionally activate innate immunity. Here, we develop a new method to assess how the genetic variation in viral populations contributes to this heterogeneity. We do this by determining the transcriptome and full-length sequences of all viral genes in single cells infected with a nominally &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; stock of influenza virus. Most cells are infected by virions with defects, some of which increase the frequency of innate-immune activation. These immunostimulatory defects are diverse and include mutations that perturb the function of the viral polymerase protein PB1, large internal deletions in viral genes, and failure to express the virus&amp;rsquo;s interferon antagonist NS1. However, immune activation remains stochastic in cells infected by virions with these defects and occasionally is triggered even by virions that express unmutated copies of all genes. Our work shows that the diverse spectrum of defects in influenza virus populations contributes to-but does not completely explain-the heterogeneity in viral gene expression and immune activation in single infected cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because influenza virus has a high mutation rate, many cells are infected by mutated virions. But so far, it has been impossible to fully characterize the sequence of the virion infecting any given cell, since conventional techniques such as flow cytometry and single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) only detect if a protein or transcript is present, not its sequence. Here we develop a new approach that uses long-read PacBio sequencing to determine the sequences of virions infecting single cells. We show that viral genetic variation explains some but not all of the cell-to-cell variability in viral gene expression and innate immune induction. Overall, our study provides the first complete picture of how viral mutations affect the course of infection in single cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological observations and animal models have long shown synergy between influenza virus infections and bacterial infections. Influenza virus infection leads to an increase in both the susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections and the severity of the bacterial infections, primarily pneumonias caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus. We show that, in addition to the widely described immune modulation and tissue-remodelling mechanisms of bacterial-viral synergy, the virus interacts directly with the bacterial surface. Similar to the recent observation of direct interactions between enteric bacteria and enteric viruses, we observed a direct interaction between influenza virus on the surface of Gram-positive, S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, and Gram-negative, Moraxella catarrhalis and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, bacterial colonizers and pathogens in the respiratory tract. Pre-incubation of influenza virus with bacteria, followed by the removal of unbound virus, increased bacterial adherence to respiratory epithelial cells in culture. This result was recapitulated in vivo, with higher bacterial burdens in murine tissues when infected with pneumococci pre-incubated with influenza virus versus control bacteria without virus. These observations support an additional mechanism of bacteria-influenza virus synergy at the earliest steps of pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we showed that housing Mx1 congenic mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11-deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Naproxen Exhibits Broad Anti-influenza Virus Activity in Mice by Impeding Viral Nucleoprotein Nuclear Export</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has previously been shown to exert antiviral activity against influenza A virus by inhibiting nucleoprotein (NP) binding to RNA. Here, we show that naproxen is a potential broad, multi-mechanistic anti-influenza virus therapeutic, as it inhibits influenza B virus replication both in vivo and in vitro. The anti-influenza B virus activity of naproxen is more efficient than that of the commonly used neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir in mice. Furthermore, the NP of influenza B virus (BNP) has a higher binding affinity to naproxen than influenza A virus NP (ANP). Specifically, naproxen targets the NP at residues F209 (BNP) and Y148 (ANP). This interaction antagonizes the nuclear export of NP normally mediated by the host export protein CRM1. This study reveals a crucial mechanism of broad-spectrum anti-influenza virus activity of naproxen, suggesting that the existing drug naproxen may be used as an anti-influenza drug.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral infection triggers host defenses through pattern-recognition receptor-mediated cytokine production, inflammasome activation, and apoptosis of the infected cells. Inflammasome-activated caspases are known to cleave cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Here, we found that apoptotic caspases are critically involved in regulating both DNA and RNA virus-triggered host defenses, in which activated caspase-3 cleaved cGAS, MAVS, and IRF3 to prevent cytokine overproduction. Caspase-3 was exclusively required in human cells, whereas caspase-7 was involved only in murine cells to inactivate cGAS, reflecting distinct regulatory mechanisms in different species. Caspase-mediated cGAS cleavage was enhanced in the presence of dsDNA. Alternative MAVS cleavage sites were used to ensure the inactivation of this critical protein. Elevated type I IFNs were detected in caspase-3-deficient cells without any infection. Casp3-/- mice consistently showed increased resistance to viral infection and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our results demonstrate that apoptotic caspases control innate immunity and maintain immune homeostasis against viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalent porcine helminth, &lt;em&gt;Ascaris suum&lt;/em&gt;, compromises pig health and reduces farm productivity worldwide. The closely related human parasite, &lt;em&gt;A. lumbricoides&lt;/em&gt;, infects more than 800 million people representing a disease burden of 1.31 million disability-adjusted life years. The infections are often chronic in nature, and the parasites have a profound ability to modulate their hosts&amp;rsquo; immune responses. This study provides the first in-depth characterisation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from different developmental stages and body parts of &lt;em&gt;A. suum&lt;/em&gt; and proposes the role of these vesicles in the host-parasite interplay. The release of EVs from the third- (L3) and fourth-stage (L4) larvae and adults was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and sequencing of EV-derived RNA identified a number of microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcripts of potential host immune targets, such as IL-13, IL-25 and IL-33, were identified. Furthermore, proteomics of EVs identified several proteins with immunomodulatory properties and other proteins previously shown to be associated with parasite EVs. Taken together, these results suggest that A. suum EVs and their cargo may play a role in host-parasite interactions. This knowledge may pave the way to novel strategies for helminth infection control and knowledge of their immune modulatory potential.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comparative Flavivirus-Host Protein Interaction Mapping Reveals Mechanisms of Dengue and Zika Virus Pathogenesis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), are a growing public health concern. Systems-level analysis of how flaviviruses hijack cellular processes through virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) provides information about their replication and pathogenic mechanisms. We used affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to compare flavivirus-host interactions for two viruses (DENV and ZIKV) in two hosts (human and mosquito). Conserved virus-host PPIs revealed that the flavivirus NS5 protein suppresses interferon stimulated genes by inhibiting recruitment of the transcription complex PAF1C and that chemical modulation of SEC61 inhibits DENV and ZIKV replication in human and mosquito cells. Finally, we identified a ZIKV-specific interaction between NS4A and ANKLE2, a gene linked to hereditary microcephaly, and showed that ZIKV NS4A causes microcephaly in Drosophila in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. Thus, comparative flavivirus-host PPI mapping provides biological insights and, when coupled with in vivo models, can be used to unravel pathogenic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza viruses inhabit a wide range of host environments using a limited repertoire of protein components. Unlike viruses with stereotyped shapes, influenza produces virions with significant morphological variability even within clonal populations. Whether this tendency to form pleiomorphic virions is coupled to compositional heterogeneity and whether it affects replicative fitness remains unclear. Here, we address these questions by developing a strain of influenza A virus amenable to rapid compositional characterization through quantitative, site-specific labeling of viral proteins. Using this strain, we find that influenza A produces virions with broad variations in size and composition from even single infected cells. This phenotypic variability contributes to virus survival during environmental challenges, including exposure to antivirals. Complementing genetic adaptations that act over larger populations and longer times, this “low-fidelity” assembly of influenza A virus allows small populations to survive environments that fluctuate over individual replication cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly neutralizing antibodies against highly variable pathogens have stimulated the design of vaccines and therapeutics. We report the use of diverse camelid single-domain antibodies to influenza virus hemagglutinin to generate multidomain antibodies with impressive breadth and potency. Multidomain antibody MD3606 protects mice against influenza A and B infection when administered intravenously or expressed locally from a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector. Crystal and single-particle electron microscopy structures of these antibodies with hemagglutinins from influenza A and B viruses reveal binding to highly conserved epitopes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that multidomain antibodies targeting multiple epitopes exhibit enhanced virus cross-reactivity and potency. In combination with adeno-associated virus-mediated gene delivery, they may provide an effective strategy to prevent infection with influenza virus and other highly variable pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Endotoxin Delivery Protein HMGB1 Mediates Caspase-11-Dependent Lethality in Sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/30314759/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/30314759/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hepatocyte-released HMGB1 mediates caspase-11-dependent lethality in sepsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HMGB1-LPS complexes are taken up by macrophages and endothelial cells via RAGE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HMGB1 destabilizes phagolysosomes for the transfer of LPS to cytosolic caspase-11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neutralizing extracellular HMGB1 inhibits caspase-11 activation in sepsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caspase-11, a cytosolic endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide: LPS) receptor, mediates pyroptosis, a lytic form of cell death. Caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis mediates lethality in endotoxemia, but it is unclear how LPS is delivered into the cytosol for the activation of caspase-11. Here we discovered that hepatocyte-released high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was required for caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and lethality in endotoxemia and bacterial sepsis. Mechanistically, hepatocyte-released HMGB1 bound LPS and targeted its internalization into the lysosomes of macrophages and endothelial cells via the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). Subsequently, HMGB1 permeabilized the phospholipid bilayer in the acidic environment of lysosomes. This resulted in LPS leakage into the cytosol and caspase-11 activation. Depletion of hepatocyte HMGB1, inhibition of hepatocyte HMGB1 release, neutralizing extracellular HMGB1, or RAGE deficiency prevented caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and death in endotoxemia and bacterial sepsis. These findings indicate that HMGB1 interacts with LPS to mediate caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis in lethal sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral proteins have evolved to target cellular organelles and usurp their functions for virus replication. Despite the knowledge of these critical functions for several organelles, little is known about peroxisomes during infection. Peroxisomes are primarily metabolic organelles with important functions in lipid metabolism. Here, we discovered that the enveloped viruses human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) induce the biogenesis of and unique morphological changes to peroxisomes to support their replication. Targeted proteomic quantification revealed a global virus-induced upregulation of peroxisomal proteins. Mathematical modeling and microscopy structural analysis show that infection triggers peroxisome growth and fission, leading to increased peroxisome numbers and irregular disc-like structures. HCMV-induced peroxisome biogenesis increased the phospholipid plasmalogen, thereby enhancing virus production. Peroxisome regulation and dependence were not observed for the non-enveloped adenovirus. Our findings uncover a role of peroxisomes in viral pathogenesis, with likely implications for multiple enveloped viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently emerged as a global health concern owing to its widespread diffusion and its association with severe neurological symptoms and microcephaly in newborns. However, the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the pathogenicity of ZIKV remain largely unknown. Here we use human neural progenitor cells and the neuronal cell line SK-N-BE2 in an integrated proteomics approach to characterize the cellular responses to viral infection at the proteome and phosphoproteome level, and use affinity proteomics to identify cellular targets of ZIKV proteins. Using this approach, we identify 386 ZIKV-interacting proteins, ZIKV-specific and pan-flaviviral activities as well as host factors with known functions in neuronal development, retinal defects and infertility. Moreover, our analysis identified 1,216 phosphorylation sites that are specifically up- or downregulated after ZIKV infection, indicating profound modulation of fundamental signalling pathways such as AKT, MAPK-ERK and ATM-ATR and thereby providing mechanistic insights into the proliferation arrest elicited by ZIKV infection. Functionally, our integrative study identifies ZIKV host-dependency factors and provides a comprehensive framework for a system-level understanding of ZIKV-induced perturbations at the levels of proteins and cellular pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important pathogen with multiple immune evasion strategies, including virally facilitated degradation of host antiviral restriction factors. Here, we describe a multiplexed approach to discover proteins with innate immune function on the basis of active degradation by the proteasome or lysosome during early-phase HCMV infection. Using three orthogonal proteomic/transcriptomic screens to quantify protein degradation, with high confidence we identified 35 proteins enriched in antiviral restriction factors. A final screen employed a comprehensive panel of viral mutants to predict viral genes that target &amp;gt;250 human proteins. This approach revealed that helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF), a DNA helicase important in DNA repair, potently inhibits early viral gene expression but is rapidly degraded during infection. The functionally unknown HCMV protein UL145 facilitates HLTF degradation by recruiting the Cullin4 E3 ligase complex. Our approach and data will enable further identifications of innate pathways targeted by HCMV and other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self-Recognition of an Inducible Host lncRNA by RIG-I Feedback Restricts Innate Immune Response</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate RNA sensor RIG-I is critical in the initiation of antiviral type I interferons (IFNs) production upon recognition of &amp;ldquo;non-self&amp;rdquo; viral RNAs. Here, we identify a host-derived, IFN-inducible long noncoding RNA, lnc-Lsm3b, that can compete with viral RNAs in the binding of RIG-I monomers and feedback inactivate the RIG-I innate function at late stage of innate response. Mechanistically, binding of lnc-Lsm3b restricts RIG-I protein&amp;rsquo;s conformational shift and prevents downstream signaling, thereby terminating type I IFNs production. Multivalent structural motifs and long-stem structure are critical features of lnc-Lsm3b for RIG-I binding and inhibition. These data reveal a non-canonical self-recognition mode in the regulation of immune response and demonstrate an important role of an inducible &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; lncRNA acting as a potent molecular decoy actively saturating RIG-I binding sites to restrict the duration of &amp;ldquo;non-self&amp;rdquo; RNA-induced innate immune response and maintaining immune homeostasis, with potential utility in inflammatory disease management.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tet2 promotes pathogen infection-induced myelopoiesis through mRNA oxidation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varieties of RNA modification form the epitranscriptome for post-transcriptional regulation. 5-Methylcytosine (5-mC) is a sparse RNA modification in messenger RNA (mRNA) under physiological conditions. The function of RNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) oxidized by ten-eleven translocation (Tet) proteins in Drosophila has been revealed more recently. However, the turnover and function of 5-mC in mammalian mRNA have been largely unknown. Tet2 suppresses myeloid malignancies mostly in an enzymatic activity-dependent manner, and is important in resolving inflammatory response in an enzymatic activity-independent way. Myelopoiesis is a common host immune response in acute and chronic infections; however, its epigenetic mechanism needs to be identified. Here we demonstrate that Tet2 promotes infection-induced myelopoiesis in an mRNA oxidation-dependent manner through Adar1-mediated repression of Socs3 expression at the post-transcription level. Tet2 promotes both abdominal sepsis-induced emergency myelopoiesis and parasite-induced mast cell expansion through decreasing mRNA levels of Socs3, a key negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway that is critical for cytokine-induced myelopoiesis. Tet2 represses Socs3 expression through Adar1, which binds and destabilizes Socs3 mRNA in a RNA editing-independent manner. For the underlying mechanism of Tet2 regulation at the mRNA level, Tet2 mediates oxidation of 5-mC in mRNA. Tet2 deficiency leads to the transcriptome-wide appearance of methylated cytosines, including ones in the 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated region of Socs3, which influences double-stranded RNA formation for Adar1 binding, probably through cytosine methylation-specific readers, such as RNA helicases. Our study reveals a previously unknown regulatory role of Tet2 at the epitranscriptomic level, promoting myelopoiesis during infection in the mammalian system by decreasing 5-mCs in mRNAs. Moreover, the inhibitory function of cytosine methylation on double-stranded RNA formation and Adar1 binding in mRNA reveals its new physiological role in the mammalian system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Golgi protein 73 (GP73) is a serum biomarker for liver diseases and HCC. However, the mechanism underlying GP73 regulates HCV infection is largely unknown. Here, we revealed that GP73 acts as a novel negative regulator of host innate immunity to facilitate HCV infection. GP73 expression is activated and correlated with interferon-beta (IFN-β) production during HCV infection in patients&amp;rsquo; serum, primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and human hepatoma cells through mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular regulated protein kinase (MEK/ERK) pathway. Detailed studies revealed that HCV infection activates MAVS that in turn recruits TRAF6 via TRAF-interacting-motifs (TIMs), and TRAF6 subsequently directly recruits GP73 to MAVS via coiled-coil domain. After binding with MAVS and TRAF6, GP73 promotes MAVS and TRAF6 degradation through proteasome-dependent pathway. Moreover, GP73 attenuates IFN-β promoter, IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) promoter and down-regulates IFN-β, IFN-λ1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56), leading to the repression of host innate immunity. Finally, knock-down of GP73 down-regulates HCV infection and replication in Huh7-MAVSR cells and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), but such repression is rescued by GP73m4 (a mutant GP73 resists to GP73-shRNA#4) in Huh7-MAVSR cells, suggesting that GP73 facilitates HCV infection. Taken together, we demonstrated that GP73 acts as a negative regulator of innate immunity to facilitate HCV infection by interacting with MAVS/TRAF6 and promoting MAVS/TRAF6 degradation. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of HCV infection and pathogenesis, and suggests that GP73 is a new potential antiviral target in the prevention and treatment of HCV associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ly6Chi monocytes regulate T cell responses in viral hepatitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/27777980/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral hepatitis remains a global health challenge despite recent progress in the development of more effective therapies. Although virus-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses are essential for viral clearance, it remains largely unknown what regulates T cell-mediated viral clearance. Thus, a better understanding of the regulation of anti-viral T cell immunity would be critical for the design of more effective therapies for viral hepatitis. Using a model of adenovirus-induced hepatitis, here we showed that adenoviral infection induced recruitment of Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes to the liver in a CCR2-dependent manner. These recruited Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes suppressed CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses to adenoviral infection, leading to a delay in viral clearance. In vivo depletion of Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes markedly enhanced anti-viral T cell responses and promoted viral clearance. Mechanistically, we showed that induction of iNOS and the production of NO by Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes are critical for the suppression of T cell responses. In addition, a contact-dependent mechanism mediated by PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction is also required for T cell suppression by Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes. These findings suggest a critical role for Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes in the regulation of T cell immunity in viral hepatitis and may provide new insights into development of more effective therapies for treating viral hepatitis based on targeting the immunosuppressing monocytes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cell autonomous regulation of herpes and influenza virus infection by the circadian clock</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses are intracellular pathogens that hijack host cell machinery and resources to replicate. Rather than being constant, host physiology is rhythmic, undergoing circadian (∼24 h) oscillations in many virus-relevant pathways, but whether daily rhythms impact on viral replication is unknown. We find that the time of day of host infection regulates virus progression in live mice and individual cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that herpes and influenza A virus infections are enhanced when host circadian rhythms are abolished by disrupting the key clock gene transcription factor Bmal1. Intracellular trafficking, biosynthetic processes, protein synthesis, and chromatin assembly all contribute to circadian regulation of virus infection. Moreover, herpesviruses differentially target components of the molecular circadian clockwork. Our work demonstrates that viruses exploit the clockwork for their own gain and that the clock represents a novel target for modulating viral replication that extends beyond any single family of these ubiquitous pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Cytomegalovirus Peptide-Specific Antibody Alters Natural Killer Cell Homeostasis and Is Shared in Several Autoimmune Diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human cytomegalovirus (hCMV), a ubiquitous beta-herpesvirus, has been associated with several autoimmune diseases. However, the direct role of hCMV in inducing autoimmune disorders remains unclear. Here we report the identification of an autoantibody that recognizes a group of peptides with a conserved motif matching the Pp150 protein of hCMV (anti-Pp150) and is shared among patients with various autoimmune diseases. Anti-Pp150 also recognizes the single-pass membrane protein CIP2A and induces the death of CD56(bright) NK cells, a natural killer cell subset whose expansion is correlated with autoimmune disease. Consistent with this finding, the percentage of circulating CD56(bright) NK cells is reduced in patients with several autoimmune diseases and negatively correlates with anti-Pp150 concentration. CD56(bright) NK cell death occurs via both antibody- and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Our findings reveal that a shared hCMV-induced autoantibody is involved in the decrease of CD56(bright) NK cells and may thus contribute to the onset of autoimmune disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung-Targeted Transgene Expression of Nanocomplexed Ad5 Enhances Immune Response in the Presence of Preexisting Immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36714358/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vector has been widely applied in vaccine development targeting infectious diseases, such as Ebola virus disease and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the high prevalence of preexisting anti-vector immunity compromises the immunogenicity of Ad5-based vaccines. Thus, there is a substantial unmet need to minimize preexisting immunity while improving the insert-induced immunity of Ad5 vectors. Herein, we address this need by utilizing biocompatible nanoparticles to modulate Ad5-host interactions. We show that positively charged human serum albumin nanoparticles ((+)HSAnp), which are capable of forming a complex with Ad5, significantly increase the transgene expression of Ad5 in both coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor-positive and -negative cells. Furthermore, in charge- and dose-dependent manners, Ad5/(+)HSAnp complexes achieve robust (up to 227-fold higher) and long-term (up to 60 days) transgene expression in the lungs of mice following intranasal instillation. Importantly, in the presence of preexisting anti-Ad5 immunity, complexed Ad5-based Ebola and COVID-19 vaccines significantly enhance antigen-specific humoral response and mucosal immunity. These findings suggest that viral aggregation and charge modification could be leveraged to engineer enhanced viral vectors for vaccines and gene therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
