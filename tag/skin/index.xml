      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of natural adhesion phenomena and mechanisms has advanced the development of a new generation of tissue adhesives in recent decades. In this study, we develop a natural biological adhesive from snail mucus gel, which consists a network of positively charged protein and polyanionic glycosaminoglycan. The malleable bulk adhesive matrix can adhere to wet tissue through multiple interactions. The biomaterial exhibits excellent haemostatic activity, biocompatibility and biodegradability, and it is effective in accelerating the healing of full-thickness skin wounds in both normal and diabetic male rats. Further mechanistic study shows it effectively promotes the polarization of macrophages towards the anti-inflammatory phenotype, alleviates inflammation in chronic wounds, and significantly improves epithelial regeneration and angiogenesis. Its abundant heparin-like glycosaminoglycan component is the main active ingredient. These findings provide theoretical and material insights into bio-inspired tissue adhesives and bioengineered scaffold designs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intradermally delivered mRNA-encapsulating extracellular vesicles for collagen-replacement therapy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of messenger RNA therapeutics largely depends on the availability of delivery systems that enable the safe, effective and stable translation of genetic material into functional proteins. Here we show that extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced via cellular nanoporation from human dermal fibroblasts, and encapsulating mRNA encoding for extracellular-matrix Î±1 type-I collagen (COL1A1) induced the formation of collagen-protein grafts and reduced wrinkle formation in the collagen-depleted dermal tissue of mice with photoaged skin. We also show that the intradermal delivery of the mRNA-loaded EVs via a microneedle array led to the prolonged and more uniform synthesis and replacement of collagen in the dermis of the animals. The intradermal delivery of EV-based COL1A1 mRNA may make for an effective protein-replacement therapy for the treatment of photoaged skin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Delay Diabetic Wound Healing by Inducing Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition via the Hippo pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36594092/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are among the most frequent complications of diabetes with significant morbidity and mortality. Diabetes can trigger neutrophils to undergo histone citrullination by protein arginine deiminase 4 (encoded by Padi4 in mice) and release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The specific mechanism of NETs-mediated wound healing impairment in diabetes remains unknown. In this study, we show neutrophils are more susceptible to NETosis in diabetic wound environments. Via in vitro experiments and in vivo models of wound healing using wide-type and Padi4 -/- mice, we demonstrate NETs can induce the activation of PAK2 via the membrane receptor TLR-9. Then PAK2 phosphorylates the intracellular protein Merlin/NF2 to inhibit the Hippo-YAP pathway. YAP binds to transcription factor SMAD2 and translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to promote endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which ultimately impedes angiogenesis and delays wound healing. Suppression of the Merlin/YAP/SMAD2 pathway can attenuate NET-induced EndMT. Inhibition of NETosis accelerates wound healing by reducing EndMT and promoting angiogenesis. Cumulatively, these data suggest NETosis delays diabetic wound healing by inducing EndMT via the Hippo-YAP pathway. Increased understanding of the molecular mechanism that regulates NETosis and EndMT will be of considerable value for providing cellular targets amenable to therapeutic intervention for DFUs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting the transcription factor HES1 by L-menthol restores protein phosphatase 6 in keratinocytes in models of psoriasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36535970/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein Phosphatase 6 down-regulation in keratinocytes is a pivotal event that amplifies the inflammatory circuits in psoriasis, indicating that restoration of protein phosphatase 6 can be a rational strategy for psoriasis treatment. Through the phenotypic screen, we here identify L-menthol that ameliorates psoriasis-like skin inflammation by increasing protein phosphatase 6 in keratinocytes. Target identification approaches reveal an indispensable role for the transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1 in governing the protein phosphatase 6-upregulating function of L-menthol in keratinocytes. The transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1 is diminished in the epidermis of psoriasis patients and imiquimod-induced mouse model, while L-menthol upregulates the transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1 by preventing its proteasomal degradation. Mechanistically, the transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1 transcriptionally activates the expression of immunoglobulin-binding protein 1 which promotes protein phosphatase 6 expression and inhibits its ubiquitination. Collectively, we discover a therapeutic compound, L-menthol, for psoriasis, and uncover the dysfunctional the transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1- immunoglobulin-binding protein 1- protein phosphatase 6 axis that contributes to psoriasis pathology by using L-menthol as a probe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblast inflammatory priming determines regenerative versus fibrotic skin repair in reindeer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36493752/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reindeer antler velvet regenerates after wounding whereas back skin forms a scar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fibroblasts direct site-specific immune cell recruitment and differentiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fibroblast fate reversion and absence of inflammatory signals enables regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obstructing fibroblast inflammatory signals enhances skin regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult mammalian skin wounds heal by forming fibrotic scars. We report that full-thickness injuries of reindeer antler skin (velvet) regenerate, whereas back skin forms fibrotic scar. Single-cell multi-omics reveal that uninjured velvet fibroblasts resemble human fetal fibroblasts, whereas back skin fibroblasts express inflammatory mediators mimicking pro-fibrotic adult human and rodent fibroblasts. Consequently, injury elicits site-specific immune responses: back skin fibroblasts amplify myeloid infiltration and maturation during repair, whereas velvet fibroblasts adopt an immunosuppressive phenotype that restricts leukocyte recruitment and hastens immune resolution. Ectopic transplantation of velvet to scar-forming back skin is initially regenerative, but progressively transitions to a fibrotic phenotype akin to the scarless fetal-to-scar-forming transition reported in humans. Skin regeneration is diminished by intensifying, or enhanced by neutralizing, these pathologic fibroblast-immune interactions. Reindeer represent a powerful comparative model for interrogating divergent wound healing outcomes, and our results nominate decoupling of fibroblast-immune interactions as a promising approach to mitigate scar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antibacterial, adhesive, and MSC exosomes encapsulated microneedles with spatio-temporal variation functions for diabetic wound healing</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSC-exos therapy show encouraging potential in diabetic wound treatment, but is hampered by insufficient delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A novel spatio-temporal-varying adhesive microneedle patch that combines the advantages of MSC-exos and antibacterial AgNPs for improving wound healing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficiency tissue repair and bacteria killing were achieved by the proposed MN patch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic wounds affect healthcare systems and increase the risk of infection. Despite the clinical demand for improving healing, an effective and safe therapeutic approach is still lacking. Here, we present a novel spatio-temporal-varying adhesive microneedle (MN) patch encapsulated with mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-exos) and antibacterial Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) for improving wound healing. This MN patch is fabricated by replicating a predesigned flexible template. Consisting of porous methacrylate gelatin hydrogels, the MN tips can continuously deliver anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic MSC-exos to wound beds, which can accelerate healing by improving cell functions, remodeling blood vessels and restoring immune systems. Besides, the silk-fibroin-composed MN back enables the patch to stick to the skin well and fix at the wounded site, thus avoiding secondary bandage. By incorporating AgNPs in the MN back, the MN patch is endowed with the ability to efficiently resist microbial contamination and further benefits wound repair. Such a composite MN patch performs well in relieving inflammation, promoting angiogenesis, and suppressing wound-infecting bacteria during wound injury in diabetic rats, with no adverse effects observed. All the features make this multifunctional MN patch potentially valuable for clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Corneal fibroblast collagen type IV negative feedback modulation of TGF beta: A fibrosis modulating system likely active in other organs</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35421526/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collagen type IV binds TGF beta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TGF beta upregulates collagen type IV production in stromal corneal fibroblasts apart from basement membranes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-basement membrane collagen type IV production likely represents a negative feedback regulatory pathway to modulate myofibroblast generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collagen type IV (COL IV) is a major component of basement membranes (BM) in all organs. It serves functions related to BM organization and modulates the passage of growth factors from one tissue compartment to another. COL IV binds transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-1 and TGF beta-2 and, therefore, is a major modulator of TGF beta pro-fibrotic functions. After fibrotic corneal injury, TGF beta enters into the stroma from the tears, epithelium, endothelium and/or aqueous humor and markedly upregulates COL IV production in corneal fibroblasts in the adjacent stroma far removed from BMs. It is hypothesized this non-BM stromal COL IV binds TGF beta-1 (and likely TGF beta-2) in competition with the binding of the growth factors to TGF beta cognate receptors and serves as a negative feedback regulatory pathway to mitigate the effects of TGF beta on stromal cells, including reducing the developmental transition of corneal fibroblasts and fibrocytes into myofibroblasts. Losartan, a known TGF beta signaling inhibitor, when applied topically to the cornea after fibrotic injury, alters this COL IV-TGF beta pathway by down-regulating COL IV production by corneal fibroblasts. Non-BM COL IV produced in response to injuries in other organs, including the lung, skin, liver, kidney, and gut, may participate in similar COL IV-TGF beta pathways and have an important role in controlling TGF beta pro-fibrotic effects in these organs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-17-induced HIF1Î± drives resistance to anti-PD-L1 via fibroblast-mediated immune exclusion</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35389431/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests that intratumoral inflammation has an outsized influence on antitumor immunity. Here, we report that IL-17, a proinflammatory cytokine widely associated with poor prognosis in solid tumors, drives the therapeutic failure of anti-PD-L1. By timing the deletion of IL-17 signaling specifically in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in late-stage tumors, we show that IL-17 signaling drives immune exclusion by activating a collagen deposition program in murine models of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Ablation of IL-17 signaling in CAFs increased the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells into the tumor mass and sensitized otherwise resistant cSCC to anti-PD-L1 treatment. Mechanistically, the collagen deposition program in CAFs was driven by IL-17-induced translation of HIF1Î±, which was mediated by direct binding of Act1, the adaptor protein of IL-17 receptor, to a stem-loop structure in the 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated region (UTR) in Hif1Î± mRNA. Disruption of Act1&amp;rsquo;s binding to Hif1Î± mRNA abolished IL-17-induced collagen deposition and enhanced anti-PD-L1-mediated tumor regression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of bromodomain extraterminal histone readers alleviates skin fibrosis in experimental models of scleroderma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35349485/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binding of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain proteins (BETs) to acetylated histone residues is critical for gene transcription. We sought to determine the antifibrotic efficacy and potential mechanisms of BET inhibition in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Blockade of BETs was done using a pan-BET inhibitor, JQ1; BRD2 inhibitor, BIC1; or BRD4 inhibitors AZD5153 or ARV825. BET inhibition, specifically BRD4 blockade, showed antifibrotic effects in an animal model of SSc and in patient-derived diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) fibroblasts. Transcriptome analysis of JQ1-treated dcSSc fibroblasts revealed differentially expressed genes related to extracellular matrix, cell cycle, and calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) signaling. The antifibrotic effect of BRD4 inhibition was mediated at least in part by downregulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II Î± and reduction of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations. On the basis of these results, we propose targeting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; pathways or BRD4 as potentially novel therapeutic approaches for progressive tissue fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Small molecules facilitate single factor-mediated sweat gland cell reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35351192/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Large skin defects severely disrupt the overall skin structure and can irreversibly damage sweat glands (SG), thus impairing the skin&amp;rsquo;s physiological function. This study aims to develop a stepwise reprogramming strategy to convert fibroblasts into SG lineages, which may provide a promising method to obtain desirable cell types for the functional repair and regeneration of damaged skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The expression of the SG markers cytokeratin 5 (CK5), cytokeratin 10 (CK10), cytokeratin 18 (CK18), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA) was assessed with quantitative PCR (qPCR), immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Calcium activity analysis was conducted to test the function of induced SG-like cells (iSGCs). Mouse xenograft models were also used to evaluate the in vivo regeneration of iSGCs. BALB/c nude mice were randomly divided into a normal group, SGM treatment group and iSGC transplantation group. Immunocytochemical analyses and starch-iodine sweat tests were used to confirm the in vivo regeneration of iSGCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; EDA overexpression drove HDF conversion into iSGCs in SG culture medium (SGM). qPCR indicated significantly increased mRNA levels of the SG markers CK5, CK18 and CEA in iSGCs, and flow cytometry data demonstrated (4.18 Â± 0.04)% of iSGCs were CK5 positive and (4.36 Â± 0.25)% of iSGCs were CK18 positive. The addition of chemical cocktails greatly accelerated the SG fate program. qPCR results revealed significantly increased mRNA expression of CK5, CK18 and CEA in iSGCs, as well as activation of the duct marker CK10 and luminal functional marker AQP5. Flow cytometry indicated, after the treatment of chemical cocktails, (23.05 Â± 2.49)% of iSGCs expressed CK5+ and (55.79 Â± 3.18)% of iSGCs expressed CK18+, respectively. Calcium activity analysis indicated that the reactivity of iSGCs to acetylcholine was close to that of primary SG cells [(60.79 Â± 7.71)% vs. (70.59 Â± 0.34)%, ns]. In vivo transplantation experiments showed approximately (5.2 Â± 1.1)% of the mice were sweat test positive, and the histological analysis results indicated that regenerated SG structures were present in iSGCs-treated mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We developed a SG reprogramming strategy to generate functional iSGCs from HDFs by using the single factor EDA in combination with SGM and small molecules. The generation of iSGCs has important implications for future in situ skin regeneration with SG restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of disturbances such as starvation, organelle damage, heat stress, hypoxia and pathogen infection can influence the autophagic process. However, how the macroautophagy/autophagy machinery is regulated intrinsically by structural damage of the cell remains largely unknown. In this work, we utilized the &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; epidermis as the model to address this question. Our results showed that structural damage by mechanical wounding exerted proximal inhibitory effect and distant promotional effect on autophagy within the same epidermal cell. By disrupting individual mechanical supporting structures, we found that only damage of the basal extracellular matrix or the underlying muscle cells activated a distinct autophagic response in the epidermis. On the contrary, structural disruption of the epidermal cells at the apical side inhibited autophagy activation caused by different stress factors. Mechanistic studies showed that the basal promotional effect of structural damage on epidermal autophagy was mediated by a mechanotransduction pathway going through the basal hemidesmosome receptor and LET-363/MTOR, while the apical inhibitory effect was mostly carried out by activation of calcium signaling. Elevated autophagy in the epidermis played a detrimental rather than a beneficial role on cell survival against structural damage. The results obtained from these studies will not only help us better understand the pathogenesis of structural damage- and autophagy-related diseases, but also provide insight into more generic rules of autophagy regulation by the structural and mechanical properties of cells across species.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bioinspired design of mannose-decorated globular lysine dendrimers promotes diabetic wound healing by orchestrating appropriate macrophage polarization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of cytokines or growth factors have been used in the treatment of inflammation. However, they are highly dependent on an optimal delivery system with sufficient loading efficiency and protection of growth factors from proteolytic degradation. To develop the immunotherapy capacity of peptide dendrimers themselves, inspired by the structure and immunoregulatory functions of mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), we thus propose a hypothesis that mannose-decorated globular lysine dendrimers (MGLDs) with precise molecular design can elicit anti-inflammatory activity through targeting and reprogramming macrophages to M2 phenotype. To achieve this, a series of mannose-decorated globular lysine dendrimers (MGLDs) was developed. Size-controlled MGLDs obtained were spherical with positive surface charges. The mean size ranged from 50-200 nm in varying generations and modification degrees. The initial screening study revealed that MGLDs have superior biocompatibility. When cocultured with MGLDs, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) acquired an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype characterized by significant mannose receptor (MR) clustering on the cell surface and the elongated shape, an increased production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²1, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, a downregulated secretory of IL-1Î², IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, and increased ability to induce fibroblast proliferation. Then in vivo studies further demonstrated that topical administration of optimized MGLDs accelerates wound repair of full-thickness cutaneous defects in type 2 diabetic mice via M2 macrophage polarization. Mechanistically, MGLDs treatment showed an enhanced closure rate, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis, along with mitigated inflammation modulated by a suppressed secretory of pro-inflammation cytokines, and increased production of TGF-Î²1. These findings provide the first evidence that the bioinspired design of MGLDs can direct M2 macrophage polarization, which may be beneficial in the therapy of injuries and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multifunctional Magnesium Organic Framework-Based Microneedle Patch for Accelerating Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34761898/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic wound healing is one of the major challenges in the biomedical fields. The conventional single drug treatments have unsatisfactory efficacy, and the drug delivery effectiveness is restricted by the penetration depth. Herein, we develop a magnesium organic framework-based microneedle patch (denoted as MN-MOF-GO-Ag) that can realize transdermal delivery and combination therapy for diabetic wound healing. Multifunctional magnesium organic frameworks (Mg-MOFs) are mixed with poly(Î³-glutamic acid) (Î³-PGA) hydrogel and loaded into the tips of MN-MOF-GO-Ag, which slowly releases Mg2+ and gallic acid in the deep layer of the dermis. The released Mg2+ induces cell migration and endothelial tubulogenesis, while gallic acid, a reactive oxygen species-scavenger, promotes antioxidation. Besides, the backing layer of MN-MOF-GO-Ag is made of Î³-PGA hydrogel and graphene oxide-silver nanocomposites (GO-Ag) which further enables excellent antibacterial effects for accelerating wound healing. The therapeutic effects of MN-MOF-GO-Ag on wound healing are demonstrated with the full-thickness cutaneous wounds of a diabetic mouse model. The significant improvement of wound healing is achieved for mice treated with MN-MOF-GO-Ag.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GPR34-mediated sensing of lysophosphatidylserine released by apoptotic neutrophils activates type 3 innate lymphoid cells to mediate tissue repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34107271/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils migrate rapidly to damaged tissue and play critical roles in host defense and tissue homeostasis. Here we investigated the mechanisms whereby neutrophils participate in tissue repair. In an intestinal epithelia injury model, neutrophil depletion exacerbated colitis and associated with reduced interleukin (IL)-22 and limited activation of type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). Co-culture with neutrophils activated ILC3s in a manner dependent on neutrophil apoptosis. Metabolomic analyses revealed that lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) from apoptotic neutrophils directly stimulated ILC3 activation. ILC3-specific deletion of Gpr34, encoding the LysoPS receptor GPR34, or inhibition of downstream PI3K-AKT or ERK suppressed IL-22 production in response to apoptotic neutrophils. Gpr34&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited compromised ILC3 activation and tissue repair during colon injury, and neutrophil depletion abrogated these defects. GPR34 deficiency in ILC3s limited IL-22 production and tissue repair in vivo in settings of colon and skin injury. Thus, GPR34 is an ILC3-expressed damage-sensing receptor that triggers tissue repair upon recognition of dying neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preventing Engrailed-1 activation in fibroblasts yields wound regeneration without scarring</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33888614/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skin scarring, the end result of adult wound healing, is detrimental to tissue form and function. &lt;em&gt;Engrailed-1&lt;/em&gt; lineage-positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are known to function in scarring, but &lt;em&gt;Engrailed-1&lt;/em&gt; lineage-negative fibroblasts (ENFs) remain poorly characterized. Using cell transplantation and transgenic mouse models, we identified a dermal ENF subpopulation that gives rise to postnatally derived EPFs by activating &lt;em&gt;Engrailed-1&lt;/em&gt; expression during adult wound healing. By studying ENF responses to substrate mechanics, we found that mechanical tension drives &lt;em&gt;Engrailed-1&lt;/em&gt; activation via canonical mechanotransduction signaling. Finally, we showed that blocking mechanotransduction signaling with either verteporfin, an inhibitor of Yes-associated protein (YAP), or fibroblast-specific transgenic YAP knockout prevents &lt;em&gt;Engrailed-1&lt;/em&gt; activation and promotes wound regeneration by ENFs, with recovery of skin appendages, ultrastructure, and mechanical strength. This finding suggests that there are two possible outcomes to postnatal wound healing: a fibrotic response (EPF-mediated) and a regenerative response (ENF-mediated).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interaction of the NRF2 and p63 transcription factors promotes keratinocyte proliferation in the epidermis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic regulation of cell and tissue function requires the coordinated action of transcription factors. However, their combinatorial activities during regeneration remain largely unexplored. Here, we discover an unexpected interaction between the cytoprotective transcription factor NRF2 and p63- a key player in epithelial morphogenesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with sequencing and reporter assays identifies enhancers and promoters that are simultaneously activated by NRF2 and p63 in human keratinocytes. Modeling of p63 and NRF2 binding to nucleosomal DNA suggests their chromatin-assisted interaction. Pharmacological and genetic activation of NRF2 increases NRF2-p63 binding to enhancers and promotes keratinocyte proliferation, which involves the common NRF2-p63 target cyclin-dependent kinase 12. These results unravel a collaborative function of NRF2 and p63 in the control of epidermal renewal and suggest their combined activation as a strategy to promote repair of human skin and other stratified epithelia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bacteria induce skin regeneration via IL-1Î² signaling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germ-free mice have low skin regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skin commensal microbiome and even pathological S. aureus induce regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bacteria induce regeneration through IL1Î²-keratinocyte-dependent IL1R/Myd88 signaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commensal bacteria promote healing in humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental factors that enhance regeneration are largely unknown. The immune system and microbiome are attributed roles in repairing and regenerating structure but their precise interplay is unclear. Here, we assessed the function of skin bacteria in wound healing and wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN), a rare adult organogenesis model. WIHN levels and stem cell markers correlate with bacterial counts, being lowest in germ-free (GF), intermediate in conventional specific pathogen-free (SPF), and highest in wild-type mice, even those infected with pathogenic &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;. Reducing skin microbiota via cage changes or topical antibiotics decreased WIHN. Inflammatory cytokine IL-1Î² and keratinocyte-dependent IL-1R-MyD88 signaling are necessary and sufficient for bacteria to promote regeneration. Finally, in a small trial, a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic also slowed skin wound healing in adult volunteers. These results demonstrate a role for IL-1Î² to control morphogenesis and support the need to reconsider routine applications of topical prophylactic antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Defining Epidermal Basal Cell States during Skin Homeostasis and Wound Healing Using Single-Cell Transcriptomics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our knowledge of transcriptional heterogeneities in epithelial stem and progenitor cell compartments is limited. Epidermal basal cells sustain cutaneous tissue maintenance and drive wound healing. Previous studies have probed basal cell heterogeneity in stem and progenitor potential, but a comprehensive dissection of basal cell dynamics during differentiation is lacking. Using single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with RNAScope and fluorescence lifetime imaging, we identify three non-proliferative and one proliferative basal cell state in homeostatic skin that differ in metabolic preference and become spatially partitioned during wound re-epithelialization. Pseudotemporal trajectory and RNA velocity analyses predict a quasi-linear differentiation hierarchy where basal cells progress from Col17a1&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt;/Trp63&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt; state to early-response state, proliferate at the juncture of these two states, or become growth arrested before differentiating into spinous cells. Wound healing induces plasticity manifested by dynamic basal-spinous interconversions at multiple basal transcriptional states. Our study provides a systematic view of epidermal cellular dynamics, supporting a revised &amp;ldquo;hierarchical-lineage&amp;rdquo; model of homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skin wound infections are a significant health problem, and antibiotic resistance is on the rise. Mast cells (MCs) have been shown to contribute to host-defense responses in certain bacterial infections, but their role in skin wound superinfection is unknown. We subjected 2 MC-deficient mouse strains to Pseudomonas aeruginosa skin wound infection and found significantly delayed wound closure in infected skin wounds. This delay was associated with impaired bacterial clearance in the absence of MCs. Engraftment of MCs restored both bacterial clearance and wound closure. Bacterial killing was dependent on IL-6 released from MCs, and engraftment with IL-6-deficient MCs failed to control wound infection. Treatment with recombinant IL-6 enhanced bacterial killing and resulted in the control of wound infection and normal wound healing in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate a defense mechanism for boosting host innate immune responses, namely effects of MC-derived IL-6 on antimicrobial functions of keratinocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
