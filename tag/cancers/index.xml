      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerable progress has been made for managing cancer, however, with these advancements, comes the discovery of previously unknown adverse events. In particular, the prolonged lifespan of patients has uncovered severe cardiotoxic side effects of widely used anticancer therapies, which restrict their administration and thus compromise the success of the seemingly most suitable treatments in large cancer patient cohorts. Vice versa, cardiovascular diseases can also promote both the onset and progression of different cancers, highlighting that both conditions are deeply interlinked. Recognizing these close interactions, the novel interdisciplinary field of cardio-oncology has emerged to closely study these uniquely correlating diseases. In this regard, non-coding RNAs are gaining increasing attention since they constitute crucial regulators in many physiological but also pathological signaling pathways, including those of cancer and cardiac dysfunction. In this review, we focus on the new subtype of non-coding RNA, circular RNAs, in their distinct exchange within cardio-oncology and discuss their suitability as potent targets for the simultaneous treatment of cardiac dysfunction and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High-resolution analysis of mononuclear phagocytes reveals GPNMB as a prognostic marker in human colorectal liver metastasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36652202/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) present with heterogenous clinical outcomes and improved classification is needed to ameliorate the therapeutic output. Macrophages (MΦ) hold promise as prognostic classifiers and therapeutic targets. Here, stemming from a single-cell analysis of mononuclear phagocytes infiltrating human CLM, we identified two M markers associated with distinct populations with opposite clinical relevance. The invasive margin of CLM was enriched in pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived MΦ (MoMΦ) expressing the monocytic marker SERPINB2, and a more differentiated population, TAMs, expressing GPNMB. SERPINB2+ MoMΦ had an early inflammatory profile, whereas GPNMB+ TAMs were enriched in pathways of matrix degradation, angiogenesis and lipid metabolism and were found closer to the tumor margin, as confirmed by spatial transcriptomics on CLM specimens. In a cohort of patients, a high infiltration of SERPINB2+ cells independently associated with longer disease-free survival (DFS) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.033), whereas a high density of GPNMB+ cells correlated with shorter DFS (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.012) and overall survival (OS) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.002). Cell-cell interaction analysis defined opposing roles for MoMΦ and TAMs, suggesting that SERPINB2+ and GPNMB+ cells are discrete populations of MΦ and may be exploited for further translation to an immune-based stratification tool. This study provides evidence of how multi-omics approaches can identify non-redundant, clinically relevant markers for further translation to immune-based patient stratification tools and therapeutic targets. GPNMB has been shown to set macrophages in an immunosuppressive mode. Our high dimensional analyses provide further evidence that GPNMB is a negative prognostic indicator and a potential player in the pro-tumor function of macrophage populations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA BC promotes lung adenocarcinoma progression by modulating IMPAD1 alternative splicing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36650118/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The therapeutic value of targeted therapies in patients with lung cancer is reduced when tumours acquire secondary resistance after an initial period of successful treatment. However, the molecular events behind the resistance to targeted therapies in lung cancer remain largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; To discover the important role and mechanism of lncRNA BC in promoting tumor metastasis and influencing clinical prognosis of LUAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials &amp;amp; methods:&lt;/em&gt; Microarrays were used to screen a comprehensive set of lncRNAs with differential expression profiles in lung cancer cells. The functional role and mechanism of lncRNA were further investigated by gain- and loss-of-function assays. RNA pull-down, protein assays, and mass spectrometry were used to identify proteins that interacted with lncRNA. TaqMan PCR was used to measure lncRNA in lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent nontumor tissues from 428 patients. The clinical significance of lncRNA identified was statistically confirmed in this cohort of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we show that the long non-coding RNA BC009639 (BC) is involved in acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies. Among the 235 long non-coding RNAs that were differentially expressed in lung cancer cell lines, with different metastatic potentials, BC promoted growth, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), both in vitro and in vivo. BC was highly expressed in 428 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and high BC expression correlated with reduced efficacy of EGFR-TKI therapy. To uncover the molecular mechanism of BC-mediated EGFR-TKI resistance in lung cancer, we screened and identified nucleolin and hnRNPK that interact with BC. BC formed the splicing complex with nucleolin and hnRNPK to facilitate the production of a non-protein-coding inositol monophosphatase domain containing 1 (IMPAD1) splice variant, instead of the protein-coding variant. The BC-mediated alternative splicing (AS) of IMPAD1 resulted in the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and resistance to EGFR-TKI in lung cancer. High BC expression correlated with clinical progress and poor survival among 402 patients with LUAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disscussion:&lt;/em&gt; Through alternative splicing, BC boosted the non-coding IMPAD1-203 transcript variant while suppressing the IMPAD1-201 variant. In order to control the processing of pre-mRNA, BC not only attracted RNA binding proteins (NCL, IGF2BP1) or splicing factors (hnRNPK), but also controlled the formation of the splicing-regulator complex by creating RNA-RNA-duplexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results reveal an important role for BC in mediating resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy in LUAD through IMPAD1 AS and in implication for the targeted therapy resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery of IHMT-337 as a potent irreversible EZH2 inhibitor targeting CDK4 transcription for malignancies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36642705/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), an enzymatic subunit of PRC2 complex, plays an important role in tumor development and progression through its catalytic and noncatalytic activities. Overexpression or gain-of-function mutations of EZH2 have been significantly associated with tumor cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). As a result, it has gained interest as a potential therapeutic target. The currently available EZH2 inhibitors, such as EPZ6438 and GSK126, are of benefit for clinical using or reached clinical trials. However, certain cancers are resistant to these enzymatic inhibitors due to its noncatalytic or transcriptional activity through modulating nonhistone proteins. Thus, it may be more effective to synergistically degrade EZH2 in addition to enzymatic inhibition. Here, through a rational design and chemical screening, we discovered a new irreversible EZH2 inhibitor, IHMT-337, which covalently bounds to and degrades EZH2 via the E3 ligase CHIP-mediated ubiquitination pathway. Moreover, we revealed that IHMT-337 affects cell cycle progression in TNBC cells through targeting transcriptional regulating of CDK4, a novel PRC2 complex- and enzymatic activity-independent function of EZH2. More significantly, our compound inhibits both DLBCL and TNBC cell proliferation in different preclinical models in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that in addition to enzymatic inhibition, destroying of EZH2 by IHMT-337 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC and other malignancies that are independent of EZH2 enzymatic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 dephosphorylates IκBα and suppresses colorectal tumorigenesis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36646759/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence demonstrates that some metabolic enzymes that phosphorylate soluble metabolites can also phosphorylate a variety of protein substrates as protein kinases to regulate cell cycle, apoptosis and many other fundamental cellular processes. However, whether a metabolic enzyme dephosphorylates protein as a protein phosphatase remains unknown. Here we reveal the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose 1,6-biphosphatase 1 (FBP1) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP) to fructose 6-phosphate (F-6-P) as a protein phosphatase by performing a high-throughput screening of metabolic phosphatases with molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Moreover, we identify IκBα as the substrate of FBP1-mediated dephosphorylation by performing phosphoproteomic analysis. Mechanistically, FBP1 directly interacts with and dephosphorylates the serine (S) 32/36 of IκBα upon TNFα stimulation, thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation. MD simulations indicate that the catalytic mechanism of FBP1-mediated IκBα dephosphorylation is similar to F-1,6-BP dephosphorylation, except for higher energetic barriers for IκBα dephosphorylation. Functionally, FBP1-dependent NF-κB inactivation suppresses colorectal tumorigenesis by sensitizing tumor cells to inflammatory stresses and preventing the mobilization of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Our finding reveals a previously unrecognized role of FBP1 as a protein phosphatase and establishes the critical role of FBP1-mediated IκBα dephosphorylation in colorectal tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular residual disease and efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36646802/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite standard-of-care treatment, more than 30% of patients with resectable colorectal cancer (CRC) relapse. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis may enable postsurgical risk stratification and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) treatment decision-making. We report results from GALAXY, which is an observational arm of the ongoing CIRCULATE-Japan study (UMIN000039205) that analyzed presurgical and postsurgical ctDNA in patients with stage II-IV resectable CRC (n = 1,039). In this cohort, with a median follow-up of 16.74 months (range 0.49-24.83 months), postsurgical ctDNA positivity (at 4 weeks after surgery) was associated with higher recurrence risk (hazard ratio (HR) 10.0, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and was the most significant prognostic factor associated with recurrence risk in patients with stage II or III CRC (HR 10.82, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Furthermore, postsurgical ctDNA positivity identified patients with stage II or III CRC who derived benefit from ACT (HR 6.59, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). The results of our study, a large and comprehensive prospective analysis of ctDNA in resectable CRC, support the use of ctDNA testing to identify patients who are at increased risk of recurrence and are likely to benefit from ACT.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Niche stiffness sustains cancer stemness via TAZ and NANOG phase separation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36646707/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence shows that the biomechanical environment is required to support cancer stem cells (CSCs), which play a crucial role in drug resistance. However, how mechanotransduction signals regulate CSCs and its clinical significance has remained unclear. Using clinical-practice ultrasound elastography for patients&amp;rsquo; lesions and atomic force microscopy for surgical samples, we reveal that increased matrix stiffness is associated with poor responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, worse prognosis, and CSC enrichment in patients with breast cancer. Mechanically, TAZ activated by biomechanics enhances CSC properties via phase separation with NANOG. TAZ-NANOG phase separation, which is dependent on acidic residues in the N-terminal activation domain of NANOG, promotes the transcription of SOX2 and OCT4. Therapeutically, targeting NANOG or TAZ reduces CSCs and enhances the chemosensitivity in vivo. Collectively, this study demonstrated that the phase separation of a pluripotency transcription factor links mechanical cues in the niche to the fate of CSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nucleus-exported CLOCK acetylates PRPS to promote de novo nucleotide synthesis and liver tumour growth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impairment of the circadian clock is linked to cancer development. However, whether the circadian clock is modulated by oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases remains unclear. Here we demonstrated that receptor tyrosine kinase activation promotes CK2-mediated CLOCK S106 phosphorylation and subsequent disassembly of the CLOCK–BMAL1 dimer and suppression of the downstream gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In addition, CLOCK S106 phosphorylation exposes its nuclear export signal to bind Exportin1 for nuclear exportation. Cytosolic CLOCK acetylates PRPS1/2 K29 and blocks HSC70-mediated and lysosome-dependent PRPS1/2 degradation. Stabilized PRPS1/2 promote de novo nucleotide synthesis and HCC cell proliferation and liver tumour growth. Furthermore, CLOCK S106 phosphorylation and PRPS1/2 K29 acetylation are positively correlated in human HCC specimens and with HCC poor prognosis. These findings delineate a critical mechanism by which oncogenic signalling inhibits canonical CLOCK transcriptional activity and simultaneously confers CLOCK with instrumental moonlighting functions to promote nucleotide synthesis and tumour growth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pancreatic cancer cells upregulate LPAR4 in response to isolation stress to promote an ECM-enriched niche and support tumour initiation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36646789/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining drivers of tumour initiation can provide opportunities to control cancer progression. Here we report that lysophosphatidic acid receptor 4 (LPAR4) becomes transiently upregulated on pancreatic cancer cells exposed to environmental stress or chemotherapy where it promotes stress tolerance, drug resistance, self-renewal and tumour initiation. Pancreatic cancer cells gain LPAR4 expression in response to stress by downregulating a tumour suppressor, miR-139-5p. Even in the absence of exogenous lysophosphatidic acid, LPAR4-expressing tumour cells display an enrichment of extracellular matrix genes that are established drivers of cancer stemness. Mechanistically, upregulation of fibronectin via an LPAR4/AKT/CREB axis is indispensable for LPAR4-induced tumour initiation and stress tolerance. Moreover, ligation of this fibronectin-containing matrix via integrins α5β1 or αVβ3 can transfer stress tolerance to LPAR4-negative cells. Therefore, stress- or drug-induced LPAR4 enhances cell-autonomous production of a fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix, allowing cells to survive ‘isolation stress’ and compensate for the absence of stromal-derived factors by creating their own tumour-initiating niche.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting KRAS-mutant stomach/colorectal tumors by disrupting the ERK2-p53 complex</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36641751/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;p53 associates with phosphorylated ERK2 through a hydrophobic interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutant KRAS enables ERK2 to interact with p53 based on conformation change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trametinib disrupts the ERK2-p53 complex by blocking ERK2 phosphorylation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trametinib promotes PUMA transcription by recruiting p300/CBP to p53 protein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KRAS is widely mutated in human cancers, resulting in unchecked tumor proliferation and metastasis, which makes identifying KRAS-targeting therapies a priority. Herein, we observe that mutant KRAS specifically promotes the formation of the ERK2-p53 complex in stomach/colorectal tumor cells. Disruption of this complex by applying MEK1/2 and ERK2 inhibitors elicits strong apoptotic responses in a p53-dependent manner, validated by genome-wide knockout screening. Mechanistically, p53 physically associates with phosphorylated ERK2 through a hydrophobic interaction in the presence of mutant KRAS, which suppresses p53 activation by preventing the recruitment of p300/CBP; trametinib disrupts the ERK2-p53 complex by reducing ERK2 phosphorylation, allowing the acetylation of p53 protein by recruiting p300/CBP; acetylated p53 activates PUMA transcription and thereby kills KRAS-mutant tumors. Our study shows an important role for the ERK2-p53 complex and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for treating KRAS-mutant cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of mechanism of cancer-cell-specific reactivation of hTERT offers therapeutic opportunities for blocking telomerase specifically in human colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcriptional reactivation of hTERT is the limiting step in tumorigenesis. While mutations in hTERT promoter present in 19% of cancers are recognized as key drivers of hTERT reactivation, mechanisms by which wildtype hTERT (WT-hTERT) promoter is reactivated, in majority of human cancers, remain unknown. Using primary colorectal cancers (CRC) we identified Tert INTeracting region 2 (T-INT2), the critical chromatin region essential for reactivating WT-hTERT promoter in CRCs. Elevated β-catenin and JunD level in CRC facilitates chromatin interaction between hTERT promoter and T-INT2 that is necessary to turn on hTERTexpression. Pharmacological screens uncovered salinomycin, which inhibits JunD mediated hTERT-T-INT2 interaction that is required for the formation of a stable transcription complex on the hTERT promoter. Our results showed for the first time how known CRC alterations, such as APC, lead to WT-hTERT promoter reactivation during stepwise-tumorigenesis and provide a new perspective for developing cancer-specific drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oxidative stress-triggered Wnt signaling perturbation characterizes the tipping point of lung adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36627278/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lkb1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency confers the Kras-mutant lung cancer with strong plasticity and the potential for adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation (AST). However, it remains largely unknown how &lt;em&gt;Lkb1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency dynamically regulates AST. Using the classical AST mouse model (&lt;em&gt;Kras&lt;sup&gt;LSL-G12D/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Lkb1&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, KL), we here comprehensively analyze the temporal transcriptomic dynamics of lung tumors at different stages by dynamic network biomarker (DNB) and identify the tipping point at which the Wnt signaling is abruptly suppressed by the excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through its downstream effector FOXO3A. Bidirectional genetic perturbation of the Wnt pathway using two different &lt;em&gt;Ctnnb1&lt;/em&gt; conditional knockout mouse strains confirms its essential role in the negative regulation of AST. Importantly, pharmacological activation of the Wnt pathway before but not after the tipping point inhibits squamous transdifferentiation, highlighting the irreversibility of AST after crossing the tipping point. Through comparative transcriptomic analyses of mouse and human tumors, we find that the lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma form a &amp;ldquo;Yin-Yang&amp;rdquo; counteracting network. Interestingly, inactivation of the Wnt pathway preferentially suppresses the adenomatous lineage TF network and thus disrupts the &amp;ldquo;Yin-Yang&amp;rdquo; homeostasis to lean towards the squamous lineage, whereas ectopic expression of NKX2-1, an adenomatous lineage TF, significantly dampens such phenotypic transition accelerated by the Wnt pathway inactivation. The negative correlation between the Wnt pathway and AST is further observed in a large cohort of human lung adenosquamous carcinoma. Collectively, our study identifies the tipping point of AST and highlights an essential role of the ROS-Wnt axis in dynamically orchestrating the homeostasis between adeno- and squamous-specific TF networks at the AST tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting Src reactivates pyroptosis to reverse chemoresistance in lung and pancreatic cancer models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36630483/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic and lung cancers frequently develop resistance to chemotherapy-induced cell apoptosis during the treatment, indicating that targeting nonapoptotic-related pathways, such as pyroptosis, can be an alternative cancer treatment strategy. Pyroptosis is a gasdermin-driven lytic programmed cell death triggered by inflammatory caspases when initiated by canonical or noncanonical pathways that has been recently seen as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment. However, overcoming chemoresistance in cancers by modulating pyroptosis has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that β5-integrin represses chemotherapy-induced canonical pyroptosis to confer cancer chemoresistance through ASAH2-driven sphingolipid metabolic reprogramming. Clinically, high β5-integrin expression associates with poor patient prognosis and chemotherapeutic responses in cancers. In addition, chemoresistant cells in vitro fail to undergo chemotherapy-induced pyroptosis, which is controlled by β5-integrin. Mechanistically, proteomic and lipidomic analyses indicate that β5-integrin up-regulates sphingolipid metabolic enzyme ceramidase (ASAH2) expression through Src-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, which then reduces the metabolite ceramide concentration and subsequent ROS production to prohibit chemotherapy-induced canonical pyroptosis. Using cancer cell lines, patient-derived tumor organoids, and orthotopic lung and pancreatic animal models, we show that administration of a Src or ceramidase inhibitor rescues the response of chemoresistant pancreatic and lung cancer cells to chemotherapy by reactivating pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our results suggest that pyroptosis-based therapy is a means to improve cancer treatment and warrants further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updated epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36631716/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, gastrointestinal cancers represent more than one-fourth of all cancer incidence and one-third of cancer-related mortality. Although there has been much progress in screening colorectal cancer, the prognosis of other gastrointestinal cancers tends to be poor. The highest burden of gastrointestinal cancers, including stomach, liver, oesophageal and gallbladder cancers, was observed in regions in East Asia. The increasing burden of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asian regions is related to population growth, ageing and the westernization of lifestyle habits in this region. Furthermore, the rising incidence of young-onset colorectal cancer is an emerging trend in East Asia. This Review provides a comprehensive and updated summary of the epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia, with emphasis on comparing their epidemiology in East Asia with that in Western regions, and highlights the major risk factors and implications for prevention. Overall, to optimally reduce the disease burden incurred by gastrointestinal cancers in East Asian regions, a concerted effort will be needed to modify unhealthy lifestyles, promote vaccination against the hepatitis virus, control Helicobacter pylori, liver fluke and hepatitis virus infections, increase the uptake rate of colorectal cancer screening, enhance detection of early cancers and their precursors, and improve cancer survivorship through an organized rehabilitation programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a substantial burden of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia, with the highest incidence observed in colorectal and stomach cancer and the highest mortality in liver and stomach cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared with Western regions, East Asia has a higher burden of stomach, liver, oesophageal and gallbladder cancer, but the burden of colorectal and pancreatic cancer is increasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an increasing trend in young-onset colorectal, pancreatic and gallbladder cancer in East Asia attributed to the bigger increase in risk factors among the younger population.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common modifiable risk factors for gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia include smoking, alcohol intake, diet, sedentary lifestyle, obesity and metabolic diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;East Asian regions have a higher prevalence of &lt;em&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt;, liver fluke, and hepatitis B and C virus infections, hot beverage consumption and biliary cyst development, which might have increased the risk of gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key preventive strategies for gastrointestinal cancers in the East Asian population include lifestyle modifications, hepatitis vaccination, &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; infection control, cancer screening, early diagnosis and improving cancer survivorship.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>ATOH8 binds SMAD3 to induce cellular senescence and prevent Ras-driven malignant transformation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36626550/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How normal cells escape oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and become malignant tumor cells remains largely unclear. Herein, we report that p53/p16/p15-independent senescence, which is mediated by TGF-β1–induced SMAD3–ATOH8–directed anti–cell cycle transcriptional program, is a barrier to oncogenic Ras-driven tumorigenesis in lung epithelial cells. ATOH8 loss switches the prosenescent effect of TGF-β1/SMAD3 to be oncogenic, facilitates transformation of lung epithelial cells to become lung cancer cells, and accelerates Ras-driven lung tumorigenesis in a manner requiring SMAD3. The potential tumor suppressor ATOH8 is inactivated by aberrant hypermethylation in lung cancer. Altogether, our study displays an important interplay between the prosenescent and transforming effects of TGF-β/SMAD3 underlying mutant Ras–driven senescence and oncogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and the conversion between OIS and malignant transformation during carcinogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that following overactivation of oncogene Ras in lung epithelial cells, high-level transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)-activated SMAD3, but not SMAD2 or SMAD4, plays a determinant role in inducing cellular senescence independent of the p53/p16/p15 senescence pathways. Importantly, SMAD3 binds a potential tumor suppressor ATOH8 to form a transcriptional complex that directly represses a series of cell cycle-promoting genes and consequently causes senescence in lung epithelial cells. Interestingly, the prosenescent SMAD3 converts to being oncogenic and essentially facilitates oncogenic Ras-driven malignant transformation. Furthermore, depleting Atoh8 rapidly accelerates oncogenic Ras-driven lung tumorigenesis, and lung cancers driven by mutant Ras and Atoh8 loss, but not by mutant Ras only, are sensitive to treatment of a specific SMAD3 inhibitor. Moreover, hypermethylation of the ATOH8 gene can be found in approximately 12% of clinical lung cancer cases. Together, our findings demonstrate not only epithelial cellular senescence directed by a potential tumor suppressor-controlled transcriptional program but also an important interplay between the prosenescent and transforming effects of TGF-β/SMAD3, potentially laying a foundation for developing early detection and anticancer strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SHP2 deneddylation mediates tumor immunosuppression in colon cancer via the CD47/SIRPα axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36626230/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIPRα on macrophages binds with CD47 to resist pro-engulfment signals, but how the downstream signal of SIPRα controls tumor-infiltrating macrophages (TIMs) is still poorly clarified. Here we reported that the CD47/SIRPα axis requires the deneddylation of tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. Mechanistically, SHP2 is constitutively neddylated on K358 and K364 sites, thus its auto-inhibited conformation is maintained. In response to CD47-liganded SIRPα, SHP2 is deneddylated by SENP8, which leads to the dephosphorylation of relevant substrates at the phagocytic cup and subsequent inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis. Furthermore, neddylation inactivated myeloid-SHP2 and greatly boosted the efficacy of colorectal cancer (CRC) immunotherapy. Importantly, we observed that the supplementation with SHP2 allosteric inhibitors sensitized the immune treatment-resistant CRC to immunotherapy. Our results emphasized that the CRC subtype which is unresponsive to immunotherapy relies on SIRPαhiSHP2hiNEDD8lo TIMs, and highlighted the need to further combine the strategy of SHP2 targeting in colorectal cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tryptophan Metabolism Acts as a New Anti-Ferroptotic Pathway to Mediate Tumor Growth</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36627132/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence reveals that amino acid metabolism plays an important role in ferroptotic cell death. The conversion of methionine to cysteine is well known to protect tumour cells from ferroptosis upon cysteine starvation through transamination. However, whether amino acids-produced metabolites participate in ferroptosis independent of the cysteine pathway is largely unknown. Here, the authors show that the tryptophan metabolites serotonin (5-HT) and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HA) remarkably facilitate tumour cells to escape from ferroptosis distinct from cysteine-mediated ferroptosis inhibition. Mechanistically, both 5-HT and 3-HA act as potent radical trapping antioxidants (RTA) to eliminate lipid peroxidation, thereby inhibiting ferroptotic cell death. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) markedly abrogates the protective effect of 5-HT via degrading 5-HT. Deficiency of MAOA renders cancer cells resistant to ferroptosis upon 5-HT treatment. Kynureninase (KYNU), which is essential for 3-HA production, confers cells resistant to ferroptotic cell death, whereas 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO) significantly blocks 3-HA mediated ferroptosis inhibition by consuming 3-HA. In addition, the expression level of HAAO is positively correlated with lipid peroxidation and clinical outcome. Together, the findings demonstrate that tryptophan metabolism works as a new anti-ferroptotic pathway to promote tumour growth, and targeting this pathway will be a promising therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blockade of NMT1 enzymatic activity inhibits N-myristoylation of VILIP3 protein and suppresses liver cancer progression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36617552/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Identification of the underlying mechanism of HCC progression and exploration of new therapeutic drugs are urgently needed. Here, a compound library consisting of 419 FDA-approved drugs was taken to screen potential anticancer drugs. A series of functional assays showed that desloratadine, an antiallergic drug, can repress proliferation in HCC cell lines, cell-derived xenograft (CDX), patient-derived organoid (PDO) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. N-myristoyl transferase 1 (NMT1) was identified as a target protein of desloratadine by drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Upregulation of NMT1 expression enhanced but NMT1 knockdown suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Metabolic labeling and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that Visinin-like protein 3 (VILIP3) was a new substrate of NMT1 in protein N-myristoylation modification, and high NMT1 or VILIP3 expression was associated with advanced stages and poor survival in HCC. Mechanistically, desloratadine binds to Asn-246 in NMT1 and inhibits its enzymatic activity, disrupting the NMT1-mediated myristoylation of the VILIP3 protein and subsequent NFκB/Bcl-2 signaling. Conclusively, this study demonstrates that desloratadine may be a novel anticancer drug and that NMT1-mediated myristoylation contributes to HCC progression and is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death with a major risk factor being chronic inflammation. Despite the link between colitis and cancer, the mechanism by which inflammation leads to CRC is not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate whether different forms of inflammation pose the same risk of cancer, we compared several murine models of colitis (dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), 4-ethoxylmethylene-2-phenyloxazol-5-one (oxazolone), &lt;em&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/em&gt;, and doxorubicin) with respect to their ability to lead to colonic tumorigenesis. We attempted to correlate the severity of colitis and inflammatory profile with the risk of tumorigenesis in both azoxymethane (AOM)-dependent and &lt;em&gt;Dclk1/APC&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; murine models of colitis-associated cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; DSS colitis reproducibly led to colonic tumors in both mouse models of colitis-associated cancer. In contrast, all the other forms of colitis did not lead to cancer. When compared to the colitis not associated with tumorigenesis, DSS-colitis was characterized by significantly increased CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages and CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6G&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neutrophils. Interestingly, depletion of the CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages inhibited tumorigenesis, whereas depletion of CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6G&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neutrophils had no effect on tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the macrophage-derived cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were significantly increased in DSS-colitis and promoted stemness of Dclk1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tuft cells that serve as the cellular origin of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We have identified CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages as key mediators of cancer initiation in colitis-associated cancer. Development of new therapies that target these cells may provide an effective preventative strategy for colitis-associated cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multistain deep learning for prediction of prognosis and therapy response in colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it has long been known that the immune cell composition has a strong prognostic and predictive value in colorectal cancer (CRC), scoring systems such as the immunoscore (IS) or quantification of intraepithelial lymphocytes are only slowly being adopted into clinical routine use and have their limitations. To address this we established and evaluated a multistain deep learning model (MSDLM) utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to determine the AImmunoscore (AIS) in more than 1,000 patients with CRC. Our model had high prognostic capabilities and outperformed other clinical, molecular and immune cell-based parameters. It could also be used to predict the response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with rectal cancer. Using an explainable AI approach, we confirmed that the MSDLM&amp;rsquo;s decisions were based on established cellular patterns of anti-tumor immunity. Hence, the AIS could provide clinicians with a valuable decision-making tool based on the tumor immune microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of faecal extracellular vesicles as novel biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36604402/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies that is usually detected late in the clinic. The currently available diagnostic tools for CRC are either invasive or insensitive to early lesions due to the dearth of reliable biomarkers. In this study, we discovered that the extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the faeces of CRC patients can act as a potent biomarker for the non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of CRC. This finding is based on the identification of two transmembrane proteins-CD147 and A33-on faeces-derived EVs (fEVs) that are intrinsically associated with CRC. The detection results show that the levels of CD147 and A33 on fEVs were upregulated in the CRC patients (n = 48), dramatically distinguishing them from the healthy donors (n = 16). The CD147/A33-enriched EVs offer a clinical sensitivity of 89%, much higher than that (40%) of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a clinically-established serum biomarker for CRC diagnosis. In addition, the analysis of longitudinal faeces samples (n = 29) demonstrated that the CD147/A33-enriched fEVs can be utilized to track the prognosis of CRC. Due to the high compliance of faeces-based detection, the CD147/A33-enriched fEVs could serve as new-generation CRC biomarkers for large-scale, non-invasive CRC screening as well as real-time monitoring of patient outcomes during clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HERC3 promotes YAP/TAZ stability and tumorigenesis independently of its ubiquitin ligase activity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36598329/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YAP/TAZ transcriptional co-activators play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis. In the Hippo pathway, diverse signals activate the MST-LATS kinase cascade that leads to YAP/TAZ phosphorylation, and subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by SCFβ-TrCP. When the MST-LATS kinase cascade is inactive, unphosphorylated or dephosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocate into the nucleus to mediate TEAD-dependent gene transcription. Hippo signaling-independent YAP/TAZ activation in human malignancies has also been observed, yet the mechanism remains largely elusive. Here, we report that the ubiquitin E3 ligase HERC3 can promote YAP/TAZ activation independently of its enzymatic activity. HERC3 directly binds to β-TrCP, blocks its interaction with YAP/TAZ, and thus prevents YAP/TAZ ubiquitination and degradation. Expression levels of HERC3 correlate with YAP/TAZ protein levels and expression of YAP/TAZ target genes in breast tumor cells and tissues. Accordingly, knockdown of HERC3 expression ameliorates tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells. Our results establish HERC3 as a critical regulator of the YAP/TAZ stability and a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A double-switch pHLIP system enables selective enrichment of circulating tumor microenvironment-derived extracellular vesicles</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36595702/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circulating tumor environment-derived extracellular vesicles (cTME-EVs) are a small portion of EVs in blood co-existing with those derived from other tissues; the accurate identification of cTME-EVs could facilitate both fundamental research and clinical liquid biopsy of cancer. In this work, we report the double-switch pH-low insertion peptide (D-S pHLIP) system, which allows selective enrichment of cTME-EVs from blood serum for comprehensive transcriptomic analysis. Plentiful differentially expressed genes and hub genes were identified, demonstrating the high performance of this technology. This work contributes to the design of pHLIP variants for specific functions and the discovery of tumor diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circulating tumor microenvironment-derived extracellular vesicles (cTME-EVs) are gaining considerable traction in cancer research and liquid biopsy. However, the study of cTME-EVs is largely limited by the dearth of a general isolation technique to selectively enrich cTME-EVs from biological fluids for downstream analysis. In this work, we broke through this dilemma by presenting a double-switch pH-low insertion peptide (D-S pHLIP) system to exclusively harvest cTME-EVs from the blood serum of tumor mouse models. This D-S pHLIP system consists of a highly sensitive pH-driven conformational switch (pKa ≈ 6.8) that allows specific installation of D-S pHLIP on the EV membranes in TME (pH 6.5 to 6.8) and a unique hook-like switch to &amp;ldquo;lock&amp;rdquo; the peptide securely on the cTME-EVs during the systemic circulation. The D-S pHLIP-anchored cTME-EVs were magnetically enriched and then analyzed with high-resolution messenger RNA sequencing, by which more than 18 times the number of TME-related differentially expressed genes and 10 times the number of hub genes were identified, compared with those achieved by the gold-standard ultracentrifugation. This work could revolutionize basic TME research as well as clinical liquid biopsy for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circadian regulator BMAL1::CLOCK promotes cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma by controlling apoptosis and cell cycle</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36595671/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a global health challenge whose incidence is growing worldwide. Previous evidence strongly supported the notion that the circadian clock controls physiological homeostasis of the liver and plays a key role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Despite the progress, cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning this HCC-clock crosstalk remain unknown. Addressing this knowledge gap, we show here that although the human HCC cells Hep3B, HepG2, and Huh7 displayed variations in circadian rhythm profiles, all cells relied on the master circadian clock transcription factors, BMAL1 and CLOCK, for sustained cell growth. Down-regulating &lt;em&gt;Bmal1&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Clock&lt;/em&gt; in the HCC cells induced apoptosis and arrested cell cycle at the G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M phase. Mechanistically, we found that inhibiting &lt;em&gt;Bmal1&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Clock&lt;/em&gt; induced dysregulation of the cell cycle regulators &lt;em&gt;Wee1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;p21&lt;/em&gt; which cooperatively contribute to tumor cell death. &lt;em&gt;Bmal1&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Clock&lt;/em&gt; knockdown caused downregulation of &lt;em&gt;Wee1&lt;/em&gt; that led to apoptosis activation and upregulation of &lt;em&gt;p21&lt;/em&gt; which arrested the cell cycle at the G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M phase. Collectively, our results suggest that the circadian clock regulators BMAL1 and CLOCK promote HCC cell proliferation by controlling &lt;em&gt;Wee1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;p21&lt;/em&gt; levels, thereby preventing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Our findings shed light on cellular impact of the clock proteins for maintaining HCC oncogenesis and provide proof-of-principle for developing cancer therapy based on modulation of the circadian clock.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lactylome analysis suggests lactylation-dependent mechanisms of metabolic adaptation in hepatocellular carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36593272/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhanced glycolysis and accumulation of lactate is a common feature in various types of cancer. Intracellular lactate drives a recently described type of posttranslational modification, lysine lactylation (Kla), on core histones. However, the impact of lactylation on biological processes of tumour cells remains largely unknown. Here we show a global lactylome profiling on a prospectively collected hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cohort. Integrative lactylome and proteome analysis of the tumours and adjacent livers identifies 9,275 Kla sites, with 9,256 sites on non-histone proteins, indicating that Kla is a prevalent modification beyond histone proteins and transcriptional regulation. Notably, Kla preferentially affects enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and carbohydrate, amino acid, fatty acid and nucleotide metabolism. We further verify that lactylation at K28 inhibits the function of adenylate kinase 2, facilitating the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells. Our study therefore reveals that Kla plays an important role in regulating cellular metabolism and may contribute to HCC progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>miRNome profiling of lung cancer metastases revealed a key role for miRNA-PD-L1 axis in the modulation of chemotherapy response</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is frequent at diagnosis and requires multimodal treatment approaches. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by surgery is the treatment of choice for operable locally advanced NSCLC (Stage IIIA). However, the majority of patients are NACT-resistant and show persistent lymph nodal metastases (LNmets) and an adverse outcome. Therefore, the identification of mechanisms and biomarkers of NACT resistance is paramount for ameliorating the prognosis of patients with Stage IIIA NSCLC. Here, we investigated the miRNome and transcriptome of chemo-naïve LNmets collected from patients with Stage IIIA NSCLC (N = 64). We found that a microRNA signature accurately predicts NACT response. Mechanistically, we discovered a miR-455-5p/PD-L1 regulatory axis which drives chemotherapy resistance, hallmarks metastases with active IFN-γ response pathway (an inducer of PD-L1 expression), and impacts T cells viability and relative abundances in tumor microenvironment (TME). Our data provide new biomarkers to predict NACT response and add molecular insights relevant for improving the management of patients with locally advanced NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting SOST using a small-molecule compound retards breast cancer bone metastasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36581888/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Breast cancer metastasis to the bone can be exacerbated by osteoporosis, is associated with poor long-term survival, and has limited therapeutic options. Sclerostin (SOST) is an endogenous inhibitor of bone formation, and an attractive target for treatment of osteoporosis. However, it is unclear whether SOST can be used as a therapeutic target for bone metastases of breast cancer, and whether small molecule compounds that target SOST in breast cancer cells can inhibit breast cancer bone metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; SOST expression in 442 breast cancer tissues was characterized by immunohistochemistry and statistically analyzed for the association with breast cancer bone metastases. Bone metastatic breast cancer SCP2 cells were induced for SOST silencing or overexpression and their bone metastatic behaviors were tested in vitro and in vivo. To identify potential therapeutics, we screened inhibitors of the interaction of SOST with STAT3 from a small chemical molecule library and tested the inhibitory effects of one inhibitor on breast cancer growth and bone metastasis in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that up-regulated SOST expression was associated with breast cancer bone metastases and worse survival of breast cancer patients. SOST silencing significantly reduced the bone metastatic capacity of SCP2 cells. SOST interacted with STAT3 to enhance the TGF-β/KRAS signaling, increasing both tumor growth and bone metastasis. Treatment with one lead candidate, S6, significantly inhibited the growth of breast-cancer organoids and bone metastasis in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings highlight a new class of potential therapeutics for treatment of bone metastasis in breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomal LOC85009 inhibits docetaxel resistance in lung adenocarcinoma through regulating ATG5-induced autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36641841/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; This study aims at investigating the role of a neighbor long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) of HDAC4 (LOC85009) in docetaxel (DTX) resistance of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; RT-qPCR was used to analyze LOC85009 expression in DTX-resistant LUAD cells. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments were applied to detect the influence of LOC85009 on LUAD cell growth and xenograft tumor growth. DNA pull down assay, RNA pull down assay, ChIP assay, CoIP assay and RIP assay were performed to identify the direct interactions between factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; LOC85009 was lowly-expressed in DTX-resistant LUAD cells. Functionally, LOC85009 overexpression inhibited DTX resistance and cell proliferation but triggered cell apoptosis. Moreover, we identified that LOC85009 was transferred from LUAD cells to DTX-resistant LUAD cells via exosomes. Exosomal LOC85009 inhibited DTX resistance, proliferation and autophagy while induced apoptosis in DTX-resistant cells. Additionally, we found that LOC85009 sequestered ubiquitin-specific proteinase 5 (USP5) to destabilize upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) protein, thereby inactivating ATG5 transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Exosomal LOC85009 inhibits DTX resistance through regulation of ATG5-induced autophagy via USP5/USF1 axis, suggesting that LOC85009 might be a potential target to reverse DTX resistance in the treatment of LUAD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J1 (UBE2J1) has been proven to participate in the ubiquitination of multiple substrate proteins. However, the underlying mechanisms of UBE2J1 as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme participating in cancer development and progression remain largely unknown. Here, we identified that UBE2J1 is downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and cell lines which are mediated by DNA hypermethylation of its promoter, and decreased UBE2J1 is associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, UBE2J1 serving as a suppressor gene inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells. Mechanistically, UBE2J1-TRIM25, forming an E2-E3 complex, physically interacts with and targets RPS3 for ubiquitination and degradation at the K214 residue. The downregulated RPS3 caused by UBE2J1 overexpression restrains NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and therefore inactivates the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our study revealed a novel role of UBE2J1-mediated RPS3 poly-ubiquitination and degradation in disrupting the NF-κB signaling pathway, which may serve as a novel and promising biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CircPDIA4 induces gastric cancer progression by promoting ERK1/2 activation and enhancing biogenesis of oncogenic circRNAs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a group of non-coding, covalently uninterrupted loop transcripts, most of which remain to be functionally characterized. Here, we identified circPDIA4 as an oncogenic circRNA in gastric cancer. Clinically, circPDIA4 was significantly upregulated in malignant tissues and associated with poor survival of gastric cancer patients. The biogenesis of circPDIA4 was mediated by the RNA binding protein Quaking, which bound intron 2 and 4 of PDIA4 pre-mRNA to promote backsplicing of exons 3 and 4. Elevated expression of circPDIA4 promoted distant metastasis in various mouse xenograft models in vivo and accelerated cancer cell invasion in vitro. CircPDIA4 functioned through distinct oncogenic mechanisms in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Cytoplasmic circPDIA4 bound to ERK1/2 and sustained hyper-activation of the MAPK pathway by preventing DUSP6-mediated ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. Notably, circPDIA4 depletion enhanced the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to ERK inhibitors. In the nucleus, circPDIA4 interacted with DHX9 as a decoy and repressed its inhibitory functions on circRNA biogenesis to boost expression of multiple oncogenic circRNAs, which promoted gastric cancer progression. These findings reveal a dual tumor-promoting mechanism for circPDIA4 by regulating oncogenic circRNA biogenesis and increasing MAPK activity. CircPDIA4 should be investigated further as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in gastric cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and preventing susceptible patients from lethal infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but have proven to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity. A combination of checkpoint blocking antibody and virus-specific antigen is covalently conjugated to polydopamine nanoparticles, which can be anchored onto bacterial surface, by a one-step in-situ polymerization of dopamine under a cell-friendly condition. By virtue of the ability to colonize and penetrate deep tumor tissue, dressed bacteria enable sustained release and expanded exposure of carried immunoactivators to stimulate immune cells. In addition to a carrier role, bacteria are able to further provoke innate immunity due to native immunogenicity of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Immunization with dressed bacteria promote the maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells, which induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in tumor-bearing mice. As evidenced by efficient production of viral antigen-specific immunoglobulin G antibody in serum and significantly suppressed tumor growth in different models, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface paves an avenue to prepare next-generation therapeutics for synergistic treatment and prevention.

      <title>The sodium channel subunit SCNN1B suppresses colorectal cancer via suppression of active c-Raf and MAPK signaling cascade</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36564468/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rising worldwide. Here, we identified SCNN1B as an outlier down-regulated in CRC and it functions as a tumor suppressor. SCNN1B mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated in primary CRC and CRC cells. In a tissue microarray cohort (N = 153), SCNN1B protein was an independent prognostic factor for favorable outcomes in CRC. Ectopic expression of SCNN1B in CRC cell lines suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, and suppressed cell migration in vitro. Xenograft models validated tumor suppressive function of SCNN1B in vivo. Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that SCNN1B correlates with KRAS signaling. Consistently, MAPK qPCR and kinase arrays revealed that SCNN1B suppressed MAPK signaling. In particular, SCNN1B overexpression suppressed p-MEK/p-ERK expression and SRE-mediated transcription activities, confirming blockade of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. Mechanistically, SCNN1B did not affect KRAS activation, instead impairing activation of c-Raf by inducing its inhibitory phosphorylation and targeting active c-Raf for degradation. The ectopic expression of c-Raf fully rescued cell proliferation and colony formation in SCNN1B-overexpressing CRC cells, confirming c-Raf as the principal molecular target of SCNN1B. In summary, we identified SCNN1B as a tumor suppressor by functioning as a c-Raf antagonist, which in turn suppressed oncogenic MEK-ERK signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy shows excellent efficacy against malignancies; however, insufficient tumor immunogenicity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment are considered as the two major stumbling blocks to a broad ICB response. Here, we report a combinational therapeutic strategy combining tumor microenvironment reactive oxygen species (ROS)/pH dual-responsive signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor nanoprodrugs MPNPs with oncolytic herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) virotherapy to synergistically ignite pyroptosis for enhancing immunotherapy. MPNPs exhibited a certain level of tumor accumulation, reduce tumor cell stemness, and enhance antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, the simultaneous application of oncolytic viruses (OVs) confers MPNPs with higher tumor penetration capacity and remarkable gasdermin E-mediated pyroptosis, thereby reshaping the tumor microenvironment and transforming &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; tumors into &amp;ldquo;hot&amp;rdquo; ones. This &amp;ldquo;fire of immunity&amp;rdquo; strategy successfully activates robust T cell-dependent antitumor responses, potentiating ICB effects against local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis in preclinical &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; murine triple-negative breast cancer and syngeneic oral cancer models. Collectively, this work may pave a new way and offer an unprecedented opportunity for the combination of OVs with nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GSCA: an integrated platform for gene set cancer analysis at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549921/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer initiation and progression are likely caused by the dysregulation of biological pathways. Gene set analysis (GSA) could improve the signal-to-noise ratio and identify potential biological insights on the gene set level. However, platforms exploring cancer multi-omics data using GSA methods are lacking. In this study, we upgraded our GSCALite to &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/GSCA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for cancer GSA at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels. In this improved &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/GSCA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GSCA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we integrated expression, mutation, drug sensitivity and clinical data from four public data sources for 33 cancer types. We introduced useful features to &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/GSCA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GSCA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including associations between immune infiltration with gene expression and genomic variations, and associations between gene set expression/mutation and clinical outcomes. &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/GSCA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GSCA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has four main functional modules for cancer GSA to explore, analyze and visualize expression, genomic variations, tumor immune infiltration, drug sensitivity and their associations with clinical outcomes. We used case studies of three gene sets: (i) seven cell cycle genes, (ii) tumor suppressor genes of PI3K pathway and (iii) oncogenes of PI3K pathway to prove the advantage of &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/GSCA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GSCA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over single gene analysis. We found novel associations of gene set expression and mutation with clinical outcomes in different cancer types on gene set level, while on single gene analysis level, they are not significant associations. In conclusion, &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/GSCA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GSCA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a user-friendly web server and a useful resource for conducting hypothesis tests by using GSA methods at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deciphering colorectal cancer genetics through multi-omic analysis of 100,204 cases and 154,587 controls of European and east Asian ancestries</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. We conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of 100,204 CRC cases and 154,587 controls of European and east Asian ancestry, identifying 205 independent risk associations, of which 50 were unreported. We performed integrative genomic, transcriptomic and methylomic analyses across large bowel mucosa and other tissues. Transcriptome- and methylome-wide association studies revealed an additional 53 risk associations. We identified 155 high-confidence effector genes functionally linked to CRC risk, many of which had no previously established role in CRC. These have multiple different functions and specifically indicate that variation in normal colorectal homeostasis, proliferation, cell adhesion, migration, immunity and microbial interactions determines CRC risk. Crosstissue analyses indicated that over a third of effector genes most probably act outside the colonic mucosa. Our findings provide insights into colorectal oncogenesis and highlight potential targets across tissues for new CRC treatment and chemoprevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interplay of four types of RNA modification writers revealed distinct tumor microenvironment and biological characteristics in pancreatic cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36601127/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal malignancies and carries a dismal mortality and morbidity. Four types of RNA modification (namely m6A, m1A, APA and A-to-I) could be catalyzed by distinct enzymatic compounds (“writers”), mediating numerous epigenetic events in carcinogenesis and immunomodulation. We aim to investigate the interplay mechanism of these writers in immunogenomic features and molecular biological characteristics in PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We first accessed the specific expression pattern and transcriptional variation of 26 RNA modification writers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Unsupervised consensus clustering was performed to divide patients into two RNA modification clusters. Then, based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among two clusters, RNA modification score (WM-Score) model was established to determine RNA modification-based subtypes and was validated in International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) dataset. What’s more, we manifested the unique status of WM-Score in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, molecular biological characteristics, targeted therapies and immunogenomic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We documented the tight-knit correlations between transcriptional expression and variation of RNA modification writers. We classified patients into two distinct RNA modification patterns (WM-Score-high and -low), The WM-Score_high subgroup was correlated with worse prognosis, Th2/Th17 cell polarization and oncogenic pathways (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; EMT, TGF-β, and mTORC1 signaling pathways), whereas the WM-Score-low subgroup associated with favorable survival rate and Th1 cell trend. WM-Score model also proved robust predictive power in interpreting transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. Additionally, the potential targeted compounds with related pathways for the WM-Score model were further identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our research unfolds a novel horizon on the interplay network of four RNA modifications in PC. This WM-Score model demonstrated powerful predictive capacity in epigenetic, immunological and biological landscape, providing a theoretical basis for future clinical judgments of PC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T cells play a determining role in the immunomodulation and prognostic evaluation of cancer treatments relying on immune activation. While specific biomarkers determine the population and distribution of T cells in tumours, the in situ activity of T cells is less studied. Here we designed T-cell-targeting fusogenic liposomes to regulate and quantify the activity of T cells by exploiting their surface redox status as a chemical target. The T-cell-targeting fusogenic liposomes equipped with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) groups neutralize reactive oxygen species protecting T cells from oxidation-induced loss of activity. Meanwhile, the production of paramagnetic 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPO) radicals allows magnetic resonance imaging quantification of the T cell activity. In multiple mouse models, the T-cell-targeting fusogenic liposomes led to efficient tumour inhibition and to early prediction of radiotherapy outcomes. This study uses a chemical targeting strategy to measure the in situ activity of T cells for cancer theranostics and may provide further understanding on engineering T cells for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ΔNp63/p73 drive metastatic colonization by controlling a regenerative epithelial stem cell program in quasi-mesenchymal cancer stem cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36538894/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ΔNp63 and p73 maintain residence in the quasi-mesenchymal breast CSC state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ΔNp63 and p73 are required for the post-extravasation proliferation of CSCs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ΔNp63 controls distinct transcriptional programs in CSCs and normal basal SCs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quasi-mesenchymal CSCs use autocrine EGFR signaling to enable metastatic colonization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer stem cells (CSCs) may serve as the cellular seeds of tumor recurrence and metastasis, and they can be generated via epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs). Isolating pure populations of CSCs is difficult because EMT programs generate multiple alternative cell states, and phenotypic plasticity permits frequent interconversions between these states. Here, we used cell-surface expression of integrin β4 (ITGB4) to isolate highly enriched populations of human breast CSCs, and we identified the gene regulatory network operating in ITGB4+ CSCs. Specifically, we identified ΔNp63 and p73, the latter of which transactivates ΔNp63, as centrally important transcriptional regulators of quasi-mesenchymal CSCs that reside in an intermediate EMT state. We found that the transcriptional program controlled by ΔNp63 in CSCs is largely distinct from the one that it orchestrates in normal basal mammary stem cells and, instead, it more closely resembles a regenerative epithelial stem cell response to wounding. Moreover, quasi-mesenchymal CSCs repurpose this program to drive metastatic colonization via autocrine EGFR signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited lymphocyte infiltration and exhaustion of tumoricidal functions in solid tumors remain a formidable obstacle to cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we designed a macrophage membrane-coated nano-gemcitabine system (MNGs) to promote lymphocyte infiltration and then synergized anti-programmed death ligand 1 (antiPD-L1) to reinvigorate the exhausted lymphocytes. MNGs exhibited effective intratumor-permeating and responsive drug-releasing capacity, produced notable elimination of versatile immunosuppressive cells, and promoted lymphocyte infiltration into cancer cell regions in tumors, but over 50% of these infiltrated lymphocytes were in the exhausted state. Compared with MNG monotherapy, the MNGs+antiPD-L1 combination produced 31.77% and 30.63% reduction of exhausted CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and 2.83- and 3.17-fold increases of interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-positive subtypes, respectively, thereby resulting in considerable therapeutic benefits in several tumor models. Thus, MNGs provide an encouraging strategy to promote lymphocyte infiltration and synergize antiPD-L1 to restore their tumoricidal function for cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Small extracellular vesicles in metabolic remodeling of tumor cells: Cargos and translational application</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warburg effect is characterized by excessive consumption of glucose by the tumor cells under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions. This metabolic reprogramming allows the tumor cells to adapt to the unique microenvironment and proliferate rapidly, and also promotes tumor metastasis and therapy resistance. Metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells is driven by the aberrant expression and activity of metabolic enzymes, which results in the accumulation of oncometabolites, and the hyperactivation of intracellular growth signals. Recent studies suggest that tumor-associated metabolic remodeling also depends on intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), also known as exosomes, are smaller than 200 nm in diameter and are formed by the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. The sEVs are instrumental in transporting cargoes such as proteins, nucleic acids or metabolites between the tumor, stromal and immune cells of the TME, and are thus involved in reprogramming the glucose metabolism of recipient cells. In this review, we have summarized the biogenesis and functions of sEVs and metabolic cargos, and the mechanisms through they drive the Warburg effect. Furthermore, the potential applications of targeting sEV-mediated metabolic pathways in tumor liquid biopsy, imaging diagnosis and drug development have also been discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that bile acids play important roles in lipid metabolism. In recent decades, bile acids have also been shown to function as signaling molecules via interacting with various receptors. Bile acids circulate continuously through the enterohepatic circulation and go through microbial transformation by gut microbes, and thus bile acids metabolism has profound effects on the liver and intestinal tissues as well as the gut microbiota. Farnesoid X receptor and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 are two pivotal bile acid receptors that highly expressed in the intestinal tissues, and they have emerged as pivotal regulators in bile acids metabolism, innate immunity and inflammatory responses. There is considerable interest in manipulating the metabolism of bile acids and the expression of bile acid receptors as this may be a promising strategy to regulate intestinal health and disease. This review aims to summarize the roles of bile acids and their receptors in regulation of gut health and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immune checkpoint therapy-elicited sialylation of IgG antibodies impairs antitumorigenic type I interferon responses in hepatocellular carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36563676/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ICB therapy catalyzes IgG sialylation in HCC that predicts an improved outcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effector T cells trigger sialylated IgG via IFN-γ-ST6Gal-I-dependent pathways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sialylated IgG binding to DC-SIGN abrogates macrophage type I IFN production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impeding IgG sialylation enhances antitumorigenic T cell immunity during ICB therapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reinvigoration of anti-tumor T cells in response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is well established. Whether and how ICB therapy manipulates antibody-mediated immune response in cancer environments, however, remains elusive. Using tandem mass spectrometric analysis of modification of immunoglobulin G (IgG) from hepatoma tissues, we identified a role of ICB therapy in catalyzing IgG sialylation in the Fc region. Effector T cells triggered sialylation of IgG via an interferon (IFN)-γ-ST6Gal-I-dependent pathway. DC-SIGN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages represented the main target cells of sialylated IgG. Upon interacting with sialylated IgG, DC-SIGN stimulated Raf-1-elicited elevation of ATF3, which inactivated cGAS-STING pathway and eliminated subsequent type-I-IFN-triggered antitumorigenic immunity. Although enhanced IgG sialylation in tumors predicted improved therapeutic outcomes for patients receiving ICB therapy, impeding IgG sialylation augmented antitumorigenic T cell immunity after ICB therapy. Thus, targeting antibody-based negative feedback action of ICB therapy has potential for improving efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrative analysis and identification of key elements and pathways regulated by Traditional Chinese Medicine (Yiqi Sanjie formula) in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36582529/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; The clinical efficacy of Yiqi Sanjie (YQSJ) formula in the treatment of stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) has been demonstrated. However, the underlying antitumor mechanisms remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; The aim of the present study was to comprehensively characterize the molecular and microbiota changes in colon tissues and fecal samples from CRC mice and in CRC cell lines treated with YQSJ or its main active component, peiminine. Integrative tandem mass tag-based proteomics and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics were used to analyze azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced CRC mouse colon tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that 0.8% (57/7568) of all detected tissue proteins and 3.2% (37/1141) of all detected tissue metabolites were significantly changed by YQSJ treatment, with enrichment in ten and six pathways associated with colon proteins and metabolites, respectively. The enriched pathways were related to inflammation, sphingolipid metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism. Metabolomics analysis of fecal samples from YQSJ-treated mice identified 121 altered fecal metabolites and seven enriched pathways including protein digestion and absorption pathway. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis of fecal samples indicated that YQSJ restored the CRC mouse microbiota structure by increasing the levels of beneficial bacteria such as Ruminococcus_1 and Prevotellaceae_UCG_001. In HCT-116 cells treated with peiminine, data-independent acquisition-based proteomics analysis showed that 1073 of the 7152 identified proteins were significantly altered and involved in 33 pathways including DNA damage repair, ferroptosis, and TGF-β signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The present study identified key regulatory elements (proteins/metabolites/bacteria) and pathways involved in the antitumor mechanisms of YQSJ, suggesting new potential therapeutic targets in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PRDM1/BLIMP1 induces cancer immune evasion by modulating the USP22-SPI1-PD-L1 axis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36509766/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blockade have achieved some efficacy but only in a fraction of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) binds to its receptor PD1 on T cells to dampen antigen-tumor immune responses. However, the mechanisms underlying PD-L1 regulation are not fully elucidated. Herein, we identify that tumoral &lt;em&gt;Prdm1&lt;/em&gt; overexpression inhibits cell growth in immune-deficient mouse models. Further, tumoral &lt;em&gt;Prdm1&lt;/em&gt; overexpression upregulates PD-L1 levels, dampening anti-tumor immunity in vivo, and neutralizes the anti-tumor efficacy of &lt;em&gt;Prdm1&lt;/em&gt; overexpression in immune-competent mouse models. Mechanistically, &lt;em&gt;PRDM1&lt;/em&gt; enhances &lt;em&gt;USP22&lt;/em&gt; transcription, thus reducing &lt;em&gt;SPI1&lt;/em&gt; protein degradation through deubiquitination, which enhances &lt;em&gt;PD-L1&lt;/em&gt; transcription. Functionally, PD-1 mAb treatment reinforces the efficacy of &lt;em&gt;Prdm1&lt;/em&gt;-overexpressing HCC immune-competent mouse models. Collectively, we demonstrate that the PRDM1-USP22-SPI1 axis regulates PD-L1 levels, resulting in infiltrated CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell exhaustion. Furthermore, &lt;em&gt;PRDM1&lt;/em&gt; overexpression combined with PD-(L)1 mAb treatment provides a therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, elucidation of the genetic defects that underlie cancer has resulted in a plethora of novel targeted cancer drugs. Although these agents can initially be highly effective, resistance to single-agent therapies remains a major challenge. Combining drugs can help avoid resistance, but the number of possible drug combinations vastly exceeds what can be tested clinically, both financially and in terms of patient availability. Rational drug combinations based on a deep understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with therapy resistance are potentially powerful in the treatment of cancer. Here, we discuss the mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies and how effective drug combinations can be identified to combat resistance. The challenges in clinically developing these combinations and future perspectives are considered.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has emerged as a critical innate immune pathway that, following engagement by DNA, promotes distinct immune effector responses that can impact virtually all aspects of tumorigenesis, from malignant cell transformation to metastasis. Here we address how natural tumor-associated processes and traditional cancer therapies are shaped by cGAS-STING signaling, and how this contributes to beneficial or detrimental outcomes of cancer. We consider current efforts to target the cGAS-STING axis in tumors and highlight new frontiers in cGAS-STING biology to inspire thinking about their connection to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two isoleucyl tRNAs that decode synonymous codons divergently regulate breast cancer metastatic growth by controlling translation of proliferation-regulating genes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36510010/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human genome contains 61 codons encoding 20 amino acids. Synonymous codons representing a given amino acid are decoded by a set of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) called isoacceptors. We report the surprising observation that two isoacceptor tRNAs that decode synonymous codons become modulated in opposing directions during breast cancer progression. Specifically, tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Ile&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;UAU&lt;/sub&gt; became upregulated, whereas tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Ile&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;UAU&lt;/sub&gt; became repressed as breast cancer cells attained enhanced metastatic capacity. Functionally, tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Ile&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;UAU&lt;/sub&gt; promoted and tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Ile&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;UAU&lt;/sub&gt; suppressed metastatic colonization in mouse xenograft models. These tRNAs mediated opposing effects on codon-dependent translation of growth-promoting genes, consistent with genomic enrichment or depletion of their cognate codons in mitotic genes. Our findings uncover a specific isoacceptor tRNA pair that act in opposition, divergently impacting growth-regulating genes and a disease phenotype. Degeneracy of the genetic code can thus be biologically exploited by human cancer cells via tRNA isoacceptor shifts that causally facilitate the transition toward a growth-promoting state.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of a novel anoikis-related gene signature to predict prognosis and tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36507553/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent histotype of non-small cell lung cancer. Anoikis, an alternative form of programmed cell death, plays a pivotal role in cancer invasion and metastasis, preventing the detached cancer cells from readhering to other substrates for abnormal proliferation. The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive analyses of the prognostic implications of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in LUAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; ARGs were selected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Genecards dataset using differential expression analysis. The signature incorporating ARGs was identified using univariate Cox regression analysis and LASSO regression analysis. Furthermore, a nomogram containing the signature and clinical information was developed through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the predictive validity of these risk models. Finally, functional analysis of the selected ARGs in signature and analysis of immune landscape were also conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A 16-gene signature was integrated to stratify LUAD patients into different survival risk groups. The prognostic risk score generated from the signature and TNM stage were identified as independent prognostic factors and utilized to develop a nomogram. Both the signature and the nomogram showed satisfactory prediction performance in predicting overall survival (OS) of LUAD patients. The ARGs were enriched in several biological functions and signaling pathways. Finally, differences of immune landscape were investigated among the high- and low-risk groups stratified by the signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study revealed potential relationships between ARGs and prognosis of LUAD. The prognostic predictors identified in present study could be utilized as potential biomarkers for clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://example.com/article/36482876/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockade of immune checkpoints as a strategy of cancer cells to overcome the immune response has received ample attention in cancer research recently. In particular, expression of PD-L1 by various cancer cells has become a paradigm in this respect. Delivery of PD-L1 to its site of action occurs either by local diffusion, or else by transport via small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, commonly referred to as exosomes). Many steps of sEVs formation, their packaging with PD-L1 and their release into the extracellular space have been studied in detail. The likely dependence of release on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signaling, however, has received little attention. This is surprising, since the intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-concentration is known as a prominent regulator of many secretory processes. Here, we report on the roles of three Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent proteins in regulating release of PD-L1-containing sEVs, as well as on the growth of tumors in mouse models. We show that sEVs release in cancer cell lines is Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent and the knockdown of the gene coding the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel protein ORAI1 reduces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signals and release of sEVs. Consequently, the T cell response is reinvigorated and tumor progression in mouse models is retarded. Furthermore, analysis of protein expression patterns in samples from human cancer tissue shows that the ORAI1 gene is significantly upregulated. Such upregulation is identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor for survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We show that reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signaling after knockdown of ORAI1 gene also compromises the activity of melanophilin and Synaptotagmin-like protein 2, two proteins, which are important for correct localization of secretory organelles within cancer cells and their transport to sites of exocytosis. Thus, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel ORAI1 and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent proteins of the secretion pathway emerge as important targets for understanding and manipulating immune checkpoint blockade by PD-L1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intratumor heterogeneity may result from the evolution of tumor cells and their continuous interactions with the tumor microenvironment which collectively drives tumorigenesis. However, an appearance of cellular and molecular heterogeneity creates a challenge to define molecular features linked to tumor malignancy. Here we perform multiregional single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of seven liver cancer patients (four hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC and three intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, iCCA). We identify cellular dynamics of malignant cells and their communication networks with tumor-associated immune cells, which are validated using additional scRNA-seq data of 25 HCC and 12 iCCA patients as a stable fingerprint embedded in a malignant ecosystem representing features of tumor aggressiveness. We further validate the top ligand-receptor interaction pairs (i.e., LGALS9-SLC1A5 and SPP1-PTGER4 between tumor cells and macrophages) associated with unique transcriptome in additional 542 HCC patients. Our study unveils stable molecular networks of malignant ecosystems, which may open a path for therapeutic exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lipid-laden lung mesenchymal cells foster breast cancer metastasis via metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells and natural killer cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36476935/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lung mesenchymal cells (MCs) store neutral lipids during breast cancer progression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-1β elicits neutral lipid accumulation in lung MCs to foster metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lipid-laden MCs metabolically reprogram both tumor cells and NK cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting lipid-laden MCs improves the efficacy of NK cell-based immunotherapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the distant organ environment is known to support metastasis of primary tumors, its metabolic roles in this process remain underdetermined. Here, in breast cancer models, we found lung-resident mesenchymal cells (MCs) accumulating neutral lipids at the pre-metastatic stage. This was partially mediated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (HILPDA) that subsequently represses adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) activity in lung MCs. MC-specific ablation of the ATGL or HILPDA genes in mice reinforced and reduced lung metastasis of breast cancer respectively, suggesting a metastasis-promoting effect of lipid-laden MCs. Mechanistically, lipid-laden MCs transported their lipids to tumor cells and natural killer (NK) cells via exosome-like vesicles, leading to heightened tumor cell survival and proliferation and NK cell dysfunction. Blockage of IL-1β, which was effective singly, improved the efficacy of adoptive NK cell immunotherapy in mitigating lung metastasis. Collectively, lung MCs metabolically regulate tumor cells and anti-tumor immunity to facilitate breast cancer lung metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of cancer immunosurveillance is a mechanism of tumor suppression that can protect the host from cancer development throughout its lifetime1,2. Yet, it is unknown whether its effectiveness fluctuates over a single day. Here, we demonstrate that the initial time-of-day of tumor engraftment dictates ensuing tumor size across murine cancer models. Using immunodeficient mice and animals lacking lineage-specific circadian functions, we show that dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells exert circadian anti-tumor functions that control melanoma volume. Specifically, we find that rhythmic trafficking of DCs to the tumor draining lymph node (dLN) governs a circadian response of tumor antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, which is dependent on circadian expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80. Consequently, cancer immunotherapy is more effective when synchronized with DC functions, shows circadian outcomes in mice and suggests similar effects in humans. These data demonstrate that circadian rhythms of anti-tumor immune components are not only critical for the control of tumor size but can also be exploited therapeutically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis has emerged as a promising target for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. Although disrupting glutathione metabolism is the primary strategy for ferroptosis induction, additional key pathways link ferroptosis to CRC pathogenesis. Here, we discuss arachidonic acid (AA), energy metabolism, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and Hippo signaling, summarize key findings, and propose new conceptual avenues for CRC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Caspase-8 as a novel mediator linking Src kinase signaling to enhanced glioblastoma malignancy </title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36460775/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caspase-8 is a cysteine protease that plays an essential role in apoptosis. Consistently with its canonical proapoptotic function, cancer cells may genetically or epigenetically downregulate its expression. Unexpectedly, Caspase-8 is often retained in cancer, suggesting the presence of alternative mechanisms that may be exploited by cancer cells to their own benefit. In this regard, we reported that Src tyrosine kinase, which is aberrantly activated in many tumors, promotes Caspase-8 phosphorylation on Tyrosine 380 (Y380) preventing its full activation. Here, we investigated the significance of Caspase-8 expression and of its phosphorylation on Y380 in glioblastoma, a brain tumor where both Caspase-8 expression and Src activity are often aberrantly upregulated. Transcriptomic analyses identified inflammatory response as a major target of Caspase-8, and in particular, NFκB signaling as one of the most affected pathways. More importantly, we could show that Src-dependent phosphorylation of Caspase-8 on Y380 drives the assembly of a multiprotein complex that triggers NFκB activation, thereby inducing the expression of inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors. Remarkably, phosphorylation on Y380 sustains neoangiogenesis and resistance to radiotherapy. In summary, our work identifies a novel interplay between Src kinase and Caspase-8 that allows cancer cells to hijack Caspase-8 to sustain tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted immunotherapy has improved patient survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but less than 20% of patients produce a durable response to these treatments. Thus, new immunotherapies that consider all key players of the complex HNSCC tumour microenvironment (TME) are necessary to further enhance tumour-specific T cell responses in patients. HNSCC is an ideal tumour type in which to evaluate immune and non-immune cell differences because of two distinct TME aetiologies (human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative disease), multiple anatomic sites for tumour growth, and clear distinctions between patients with locally advanced disease and those with recurrent and/or metastatic disease. Recent technological and scientific advancements have provided a more complete picture of all cellular constituents within this complex TME and have evaluated the interplay of both immune and non-immune cells within HNSCC. Here, we include a comprehensive analysis of the complete ecosystem of the HNSCC TME, performed utilizing data-rich resources such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, and cutting-edge techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, high-dimensional flow cytometry and spatial multispectral imaging, to generate improved treatment strategies for this diverse disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cancer microenvironment, aberrant glycosylation events of ECM proteins and cell surface receptors occur. We developed a protocol to generate 3D bioprinted models of colorectal cancer (CRC) crosslinking hyaluronic acid and gelatin functionalized with three signalling glycans characterized in CRC, 3&amp;rsquo;-Sialylgalactose, 6&amp;rsquo;-Sialylgalactose and 2&amp;rsquo;-Fucosylgalactose. The crosslinking, performed exploiting azide functionalized gelatin and hyaluronic acid and 4arm-PEG-dibenzocyclooctyne, resulted in biocompatible hydrogels that were 3D bioprinted with commercial CRC cells HT-29 and patient derived CRC tumoroids. The glycosylated hydrogels showed good 3D printability, biocompatibility and stability over the time. SEM and synchrotron radiation SAXS/WAXS analysis revealed the influence of glycosylation in the construct morphology, whereas MALDI-MS imaging showed that protein profiles of tumoroid cells vary with glycosylation, indicating that sialylation and fucosylation of ECM proteins induce diverse alterations to the proteome of the tumoroid and surrounding cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generation and multiomic profiling of a TP53/CDKN2A double-knockout gastroesophageal junction organoid model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36449602/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes tumor protein p53 (&lt;em&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt;) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (&lt;em&gt;CDKN2A&lt;/em&gt;) occurs early during gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) tumorigenesis. However, because of a paucity of GEJ-specific disease models, cancer-promoting consequences of &lt;em&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CDKN2A&lt;/em&gt; inactivation at the GEJ have not been characterized. Here, we report the development of a wild-type primary human GEJ organoid model and a CRISPR-edited transformed GEJ organoid model. CRISPR-Cas9–mediated &lt;em&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CDKN2A&lt;/em&gt; knockout (&lt;em&gt;TP53/CDKN2A&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) in GEJ organoids induced morphologic dysplasia and proneoplastic features in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Lipidomic profiling identified several platelet-activating factors (PTAFs) among the most up-regulated lipids in CRISPR-edited organoids. PTAF/PTAF receptor (PTAFR) abrogation by siRNA knockdown or a pharmacologic inhibitor (WEB2086) reduced proliferation and other proneoplastic features of &lt;em&gt;TP53/CDKN2A&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; GEJ organoids in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. In addition, murine xenografts of Eso26, an established human esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line, were suppressed by WEB2086. Mechanistically, &lt;em&gt;TP53/CDKN2A&lt;/em&gt; dual inactivation disrupted both the transcriptome and the DNA methylome, likely mediated by key transcription factors, particularly forkhead box M1 (FOXM1). FOXM1 activated &lt;em&gt;PTAFR&lt;/em&gt; transcription by binding to the &lt;em&gt;PTAFR&lt;/em&gt; promoter, further amplifying the PTAF-PTAFR pathway. Together, these studies established a robust model system for investigating early GEJ neoplastic events, identified crucial metabolic and epigenomic changes occurring during GEJ model tumorigenesis, and revealed a potential cancer therapeutic strategy. This work provides insights into proneoplastic mechanisms associated with &lt;em&gt;TP53/CDKN2A&lt;/em&gt; inactivation in early GEJ neoplasia, which may facilitate early diagnosis and prevention of GEJ neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ras drives malignancy through stem cell crosstalk with the microenvironment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squamous cell carcinomas are triggered by marked elevation of RAS-MAPK signalling and progression from benign papilloma to invasive malignancy. At tumour-stromal interfaces, a subset of tumour-initiating progenitors, the cancer stem cells, obtain increased resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy along this pathway. The distribution and changes in cancer stem cells during progression from a benign state to invasive squamous cell carcinoma remain unclear. Here we show in mice that, after oncogenic RAS activation, cancer stem cells rewire their gene expression program and trigger self-propelling, aberrant signalling crosstalk with their tissue microenvironment that drives their malignant progression. The non-genetic, dynamic cascade of intercellular exchanges involves downstream pathways that are often mutated in advanced metastatic squamous cell carcinomas with high mutational burden. Coupling our clonal skin HRAS&lt;sup&gt;G12V&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model with single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin landscaping, lentiviral reporters and lineage tracing, we show that aberrant crosstalk between cancer stem cells and their microenvironment triggers angiogenesis and TGFβ signalling, creating conditions that are conducive for hijacking leptin and leptin receptor signalling, which in turn launches downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR signalling during the benign-to-malignant transition. By functionally examining each step in this pathway, we reveal how dynamic temporal crosstalk with the microenvironment orchestrated by the stem cells profoundly fuels this path to malignancy. These insights suggest broad implications for cancer therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reprogramming of T cell-derived small extracellular vesicles using IL2 surface engineering induces potent anti-cancer effects through miRNA delivery</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36447429/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) exhibit anti-cancer effects. However, their anti-cancer potential should be reinforced to enhance clinical applicability. Herein, we generated interleukin-2-tethered sEVs (IL2-sEVs) from engineered Jurkat T cells expressing IL2 at the plasma membrane via a flexible linker to induce an autocrine effect. IL2-sEVs increased the anti-cancer ability of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells without affecting regulatory T (T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; ) cells and down-regulated cellular and exosomal PD-L1 expression in melanoma cells, causing their increased sensitivity to CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Its effect on CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T and melanoma cells was mediated by several IL2-sEV-resident microRNAs (miRNAs), whose expressions were upregulated by the autocrine effects of IL2. Among the miRNAs, miR-181a-3p and miR-223-3p notably reduced the PD-L1 protein levels in melanoma cells. Interestingly, miR-181a-3p increased the activity of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells while suppressing Treg cell activity. IL2-sEVs inhibited tumour progression in melanoma-bearing immunocompetent mice, but not in immunodeficient mice. The combination of IL2-sEVs and existing anti-cancer drugs significantly improved anti-cancer efficacy by decreasing PD-L1 expression in vivo. Thus, IL2-sEVs are potential cancer immunotherapeutic agents that regulate both immune and cancer cells by reprogramming miRNA levels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-6/STAT3 signaling in tumor cells restricts the expression of frameshift-derived neoantigens by SMG1 induction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36443756/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The quality and quantity of tumor neoantigens derived from tumor mutations determines the fate of the immune response in cancer. Frameshift mutations elicit better tumor neoantigens, especially when they are not targeted by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). For tumor progression, malignant cells need to counteract the immune response including the silencing of immunodominant neoantigens (antigen immunoediting) and promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Although NMD inhibition has been reported to induce tumor immunity and increase the expression of cryptic neoantigens, the possibility that NMD activity could be modulated by immune forces operating in the tumor microenvironment as a new immunoediting mechanism has not been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We study the effect of SMG1 expression (main kinase that initiates NMD) in the survival and the nature of the tumor immune infiltration using TCGA RNAseq and scRNAseq datasets of breast, lung and pancreatic cancer. Different murine tumor models were used to corroborate the antitumor immune dependencies of NMD. We evaluate whether changes of SMG1 expression in malignant cells impact the immune response elicited by cancer immunotherapy. To determine how NMD fluctuates in malignant cells we generated a luciferase reporter system to track NMD activity in vivo under different immune conditions. Cytokine screening, in silico studies and functional assays were conducted to determine the regulation of SMG1 via IL-6/STAT3 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; IL-6/STAT3 signaling induces SMG1, which limits the expression of potent frameshift neoantigens that are under NMD control compromising the outcome of the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We revealed a new neoantigen immunoediting mechanism regulated by immune forces (IL-6/STAT3 signaling) responsible for silencing otherwise potent frameshift mutation-derived neoantigens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrated multi-omics Landscape of liver metastases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36574521/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BACKGROUND &amp;amp; AIMS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of thorough knowledge for complicated immune-microenvironment (IM) within a variety of liver metastases (LMs) leads to inappropriate treatment and unsatisfactory prognosis. We aimed to characterize IM subtypes and investigate potential mechanisms in LMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;METHODS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass cytometry was applied to characterize immune landscape of primary liver cancers and liver metastases cohort. Transcriptomic and whole exome sequencing were used to explore potential mechanisms across distinct IM subtypes. Single cell transcriptomic sequencing, multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry, cell culture, mouse model, western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used for validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESULTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five IM subtypes were revealed in 100 LMs and 50 primary liver cancers. Patients featured terminally exhausted (IM1) or rare-T-cell-inflamed (IM2 and IM3) immune characteristics showed worse outcome. Increased intra-tumor heterogeneity, enriched somatic TP53, KRAS, APC, PIK3CA mutations and hyper-activated hypoxia signaling accounted for the formation of vicious subtypes. SLC2A1 promoted immune suppression and desert via increasing proportion of Spp1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages and their inhibitory interactions with T cells in liver metastatic lesions. Furthermore, SLC2A1 promoted immune escape and liver metastasis through inducing regulatory T cells including Tregs and LAG3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in primary colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study provided integrated multi-omics landscape of liver metastasis, uncovering potential mechanisms for vicious IM subtypes and confirming the roles of SLC2A1 in regulating tumor microenvironment remodeling in both primary tumor and liver metastatic lesions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Differential integrated stress response and asparagine production drive symbiosis and therapy resistance of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pancreatic tumor microenvironment drives deregulated nutrient availability. Accordingly, pancreatic cancer cells require metabolic adaptations to survive and proliferate. Pancreatic cancer subtypes have been characterized by transcriptional and functional differences, with subtypes reported to exist within the same tumor. However, it remains unclear if this diversity extends to metabolic programming. Here, using metabolomic profiling and functional interrogation of metabolic dependencies, we identify two distinct metabolic subclasses among neoplastic populations within individual human and mouse tumors. Furthermore, these populations are poised for metabolic cross-talk, and in examining this, we find an unexpected role for asparagine supporting proliferation during limited respiration. Constitutive GCN2 activation permits ATF4 signaling in one subtype, driving excess asparagine production. Asparagine release provides resistance during impaired respiration, enabling symbiosis. Functionally, availability of exogenous asparagine during limited respiration indirectly supports maintenance of aspartate pools, a rate-limiting biosynthetic precursor. Conversely, depletion of extracellular asparagine with PEG-asparaginase sensitizes tumors to mitochondrial targeting with phenformin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mutant RIG-I enhances cancer-related inflammation through activation of circRIG-I signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36402769/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIG-I/DDX58 plays a key role in host innate immunity. However, its therapeutic potential for inflammation-related cancers remains to be explored. Here we identify frameshift germline mutations of RIG-I occurring in patients with colon cancer. Accordingly, Rig-ifs/fs mice bearing a frameshift mutant Rig-i exhibit increased susceptibility to colitis-related colon cancer as well as enhanced inflammatory response to chemical, virus or bacteria. In addition to interruption of Rig-i mRNA translation, the Rig-i mutation changes the secondary structure of Rig-i pre-mRNA and impairs its association with DHX9, consequently inducing a circular RNA generation from Rig-i transcript, thereby, designated as circRIG-I. CircRIG-I is frequently upregulated in colon cancers and its upregulation predicts poor outcome of colon cancer. Mechanistically, circRIG-I interacts with DDX3X, which in turn stimulates MAVS/TRAF5/TBK1 signaling cascade, eventually activating IRF3-mediated type I IFN transcription and aggravating inflammatory damage. Reciprocally, all-trans retinoic acid acts as a DHX9 agonist, ameliorates immunopathology through suppression of circRIG-I biogenesis. Collectively, our results provide insight into mutant RIG-I action and propose a potential strategy for the treatment of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aberrant hyperexpression of the RNA binding protein FMRP in tumors mediates immune evasion</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36395212/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many human cancers manifest the capability to circumvent attack by the adaptive immune system. In this work, we identified a component of immune evasion that involves frequent up-regulation of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in solid tumors. FMRP represses immune attack, as revealed by cancer cells engineered to lack its expression. FMRP-deficient tumors were infiltrated by activated T cells that impaired tumor growth and enhanced survival in mice. Mechanistically, FMRP&amp;rsquo;s immunosuppression was multifactorial, involving repression of the chemoattractant C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) concomitant with up-regulation of three immunomodulators-interleukin-33 (IL-33), tumor-secreted protein S (PROS1), and extracellular vesicles. Gene signatures associate FMRP&amp;rsquo;s cancer network with poor prognosis and response to therapy in cancer patients. Collectively, FMRP is implicated as a regulator that orchestrates a multifaceted barrier to antitumor immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic alteration of the epitranscriptome exerts regulatory effects on the lifecycle of oncogenic viruses in vitro. However, little is known about these effects in vivo because of the general lack of suitable animal infection models of these viruses. Using a model of rapid-onset Marek&amp;rsquo;s disease lymphoma in chickens, we investigated changes in viral and host mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) modification during Marek&amp;rsquo;s disease virus (MDV) infection in vivo. We found that the expression of major epitranscriptomic proteins varies among viral infection phases, reprogramming both the viral and the host epitranscriptomes. Specifically, the METTL3/14 complex was suppressed during the lytic and reactivation phases of the MDV lifecycle, whereas its expression was increased during the latent phase and in MDV-induced tumors. METTL3/14 overexpression inhibits, whereas METTL3/14 knockdown enhances, MDV gene expression and replication. These findings reveal the dynamic features of the mRNA m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification program during viral replication in vivo, especially in relation to key pathways involved in tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The emerging field of oncolytic virus-based cancer immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36402738/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/36402738/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural or genetically modified oncolytic viruses (OVs) are promising antitumor agents for specifically targeting tumor cells without harming normal cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OV-based oncolysis and OV-induced antiviral immune responses play an important role in remodeling the tumor microenvironment (TME) from immunologically &amp;lsquo;cold&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;hot&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As single agents or combined with other strategies, OVs can enhance cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OV persistence, replication, spread, systemic delivery, lack of therapeutic biomarkers, and moderate efficacy as single agents are among the main challenges in the field. If these problems can be solved, OV will most likely substantially enhance clinical outcomes for cancer patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oncolytic viruses (OVs) provide novel and promising therapeutic options for patients with cancers resistant to traditional therapies. Natural or genetically modified OVs are multifaceted tumor killers. They directly lyse tumor cells while sparing normal cells, and indirectly potentiate antitumor immunity by releasing antigens and activating inflammatory responses in the tumor microenvironment. However, some limitations, such as limited penetration of OVs into tumors, short persistence, and the host antiviral immune response, are impeding the broad translation of oncolytic virotherapy into the clinic. If these challenges can be overcome, combination therapies, such as OVs plus immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, or CAR natural killer (NK) cells, may provide powerful therapeutic platforms in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic exposure to airborne carbon black ultrafine (nCB) particles generated from incomplete combustion of organic matter drives IL-17A–dependent emphysema. However, whether and how they alter the immune responses to lung cancer remains unknown. Here, we show that exposure to nCB particles increased PD-L1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; PD-L2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD206&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antigen-presenting cells (APCs), exhausted T cells, and Treg cells. Lung macrophages that harbored nCB particles showed selective mitochondrial structure damage and decreased oxidative respiration. Lung macrophages sustained the HIF1α axis that increased glycolysis and lactate production, culminating in an immunosuppressive microenvironment in multiple mouse models of non–small cell lung cancers. Adoptive transfer of lung APCs from nCB-exposed wild type to susceptible mice increased tumor incidence and caused early metastasis. Our findings show that nCB exposure metabolically rewires lung macrophages to promote immunosuppression and accelerates the development of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of regulated cell death that is triggered by the discoordination of regulatory redox mechanisms culminating in massive peroxidation of polyunsaturated phospholipids. Ferroptosis inducers have shown considerable effectiveness in killing tumour cells in vitro, yet there has been no obvious success in experimental animal models, with the notable exception of immunodeficient mice. This suggests that the effect of ferroptosis on immune cells remains poorly understood. Pathologically activated neutrophils (PMNs), termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs), are major negative regulators of anti-tumour immunity. Here we found that PMN-MDSCs in the tumour microenvironment spontaneously die by ferroptosis. Although decreasing the presence of PMN-MDSCs, ferroptosis induces the release of oxygenated lipids and limits the activity of human and mouse T cells. In immunocompetent mice, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ferroptosis abrogates suppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs, reduces tumour progression and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade to suppress the tumour growth. By contrast, induction of ferroptosis in immunocompetent mice promotes tumour growth. Thus, ferroptosis is a unique and targetable immunosuppressive mechanism of PMN-MDSCs in the tumour microenvironment that can be pharmacologically modulated to limit tumour progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TGFβ control of immune responses in cancer: a holistic immuno-oncology perspective</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immune system responds to cancer in two main ways. First, there are prewired responses involving myeloid cells, innate lymphocytes and innate-like adaptive lymphocytes that either reside in premalignant tissues or migrate directly to tumours, and second, there are antigen priming-dependent responses, in which adaptive lymphocytes are primed in secondary lymphoid organs before homing to tumours. Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) - one of the most potent and pleiotropic regulatory cytokines - controls almost every stage of the tumour-elicited immune response, from leukocyte development in primary lymphoid organs to their priming in secondary lymphoid organs and their effector functions in the tumour itself. The complexity of TGFβ-regulated immune cell circuitries, as well as the contextual roles of TGFβ signalling in cancer cells and tumour stromal cells, necessitates the use of rigorous experimental systems that closely recapitulate human cancer, such as autochthonous tumour models, to uncover the underlying immunobiology. The diverse functions of TGFβ in healthy tissues further complicate the search for effective and safe cancer therapeutics targeting the TGFβ pathway. Here we discuss the contextual complexity of TGFβ signalling in tumour-elicited immune responses and explain how understanding this may guide the development of mechanism-based cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by molecular heterogeneity with diverse immune cell infiltration patterns, which has been linked to therapy sensitivity and resistance. However, full understanding of how immune cell phenotypes vary across different patient subgroups is lacking. Here, we dissect the NSCLC tumor microenvironment at high resolution by integrating 1,283,972 single cells from 556 samples and 318 patients across 29 datasets, including our dataset capturing cells with low mRNA content. We stratify patients into immune-deserted, B cell, T cell, and myeloid cell subtypes. Using bulk samples with genomic and clinical information, we identify cellular components associated with tumor histology and genotypes. We then focus on the analysis of tissue-resident neutrophils (TRNs) and uncover distinct subpopulations that acquire new functional properties in the tissue microenvironment, providing evidence for the plasticity of TRNs. Finally, we show that a TRN-derived gene signature is associated with anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) treatment failure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid tumours display a limited response to immunotherapies. By contrast, haematological malignancies exhibit significantly higher response rates to immunotherapies as compared with solid tumours. Among several microenvironmental and biological disparities, the differential expression of unique immune regulatory molecules contributes significantly to the interaction of blood cancer cells with immune cells. The self-ligand receptor of the signalling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 7 (SLAMF7), a molecule that is critical in promoting the body&amp;rsquo;s innate immune cells to detect and engulf cancer cells, is expressed nearly exclusively on the cell surface of haematologic tumours, but not on solid ones. Here we show that a bispecific nanobioconjugate that enables the decoration of SLAMF7 on the surface of solid tumours induces robust phagocytosis and activates the phagocyte cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, sensitizing the tumours to immune checkpoint blockade. Our findings support an immunological conversion strategy that uses nano-adjuvants to improve the effectiveness of immunotherapies for solid tumours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liver tumour immune microenvironment subtypes and neutrophil heterogeneity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heterogeneity of the tumour immune microenvironment (TIME), organized by various immune and stromal cells, is a major contributing factor of tumour metastasis, relapse and drug resistance1-3, but how different TIME subtypes are connected to the clinical relevance in liver cancer remains unclear. Here we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of 189 samples collected from 124 patients and 8 mice with liver cancer. With more than 1 million cells analysed, we stratified patients into five TIME subtypes, including immune activation, immune suppression mediated by myeloid or stromal cells, immune exclusion and immune residence phenotypes. Different TIME subtypes were spatially organized and associated with chemokine networks and genomic features. Notably, tumour-associated neutrophil (TAN) populations enriched in the myeloid-cell-enriched subtype were associated with an unfavourable prognosis. Through in vitro induction of TANs and ex vivo analyses of patient TANs, we showed that CCL4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; TANs can recruit macrophages and that PD-L1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; TANs can suppress T cell cytotoxicity. Furthermore, scRNA-seq analysis of mouse neutrophil subsets revealed that they are largely conserved with those of humans. In vivo neutrophil depletion in mouse models attenuated tumour progression, confirming the pro-tumour phenotypes of TANs. With this detailed cellular heterogeneity landscape of liver cancer, our study illustrates diverse TIME subtypes, highlights immunosuppressive functions of TANs and sheds light on potential immunotherapies targeting TANs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metastatic recurrence in colorectal cancer arises from residual EMP1&#43; cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36352230/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 30-40% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) undergoing curative resection of the primary tumour will develop metastases in the subsequent years. Therapies to prevent disease relapse remain an unmet medical need. Here we uncover the identity and features of the residual tumour cells responsible for CRC relapse. An analysis of single-cell transcriptomes of samples from patients with CRC revealed that the majority of genes associated with a poor prognosis are expressed by a unique tumour cell population that we named high-relapse cells (HRCs). We established a human-like mouse model of microsatellite-stable CRC that undergoes metastatic relapse after surgical resection of the primary tumour. Residual HRCs occult in mouse livers after primary CRC surgery gave rise to multiple cell types over time, including LGR5&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stem-like tumour cells, and caused overt metastatic disease. Using Emp1 (encoding epithelial membrane protein 1) as a marker gene for HRCs, we tracked and selectively eliminated this cell population. Genetic ablation of EMP1&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cells prevented metastatic recurrence and mice remained disease-free after surgery. We also found that HRC-rich micrometastases were infiltrated with T cells, yet became progressively immune-excluded during outgrowth. Treatment with neoadjuvant immunotherapy eliminated residual metastatic cells and prevented mice from relapsing after surgery. Together, our findings reveal the cell-state dynamics of residual disease in CRC and anticipate that therapies targeting HRCs may help to avoid metastatic relapse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The transcriptional terminator XRN2 and the RNA-binding protein Sam68 link alternative polyadenylation to cell cycle progression in prostate cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36344846/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative polyadenylation (APA) yields transcripts differing in their 3′-end, and its regulation is altered in cancer, including prostate cancer. Here we have uncovered a mechanism of APA regulation impinging on the interaction between the exonuclease XRN2 and the RNA-binding protein Sam68, whose increased expression in prostate cancer is promoted by the transcription factor MYC. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling revealed a widespread impact of the Sam68/XRN2 complex on APA. XRN2 promotes recruitment of Sam68 to its target transcripts, where it competes with the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor for binding to strong polyadenylation signals at distal ends of genes, thus promoting usage of suboptimal proximal polyadenylation signals. This mechanism leads to 3′ untranslated region shortening and translation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in G1/S progression and proliferation. Thus, our findings indicate that the APA program driven by Sam68/XRN2 promotes cell cycle progression and may represent an actionable target for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Urine proteomic signatures predicting the progression from premalignancy to malignant gastric cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Early detection of gastric cancer (GC) remains challenging. We aimed to examine urine proteomic signatures and identify protein biomarkers that predict the progression of gastric lesions and risk of GC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A case-control study was initially designed, covering subjects with GC and gastric lesions of different stages. Subjects were aged 40-69 years, without prior diagnosis of renal or urological diseases. We enrolled a total of 255 subjects, with 123 in the discovery stage from Linqu, China, a high-risk area for GC and 132 in the validation stage from Linqu and Beijing. A prospective study was further designed for a subset of 60 subjects with gastric lesions, which were followed for 297-857 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Findings:&lt;/em&gt; We identified 43 differentially expressed urine proteins in subjects with GC vs. mild or advanced gastric lesions. Baseline urinary levels of ANXA11, CDC42, NAPA and SLC25A4 were further positively associated with risk of gastric lesion progression. Three of them, except for SLC25A4, also had higher expression in GC than non-GC tissues. Integrating these four proteins showed outstanding performance in predicting the progression of gastric lesions (AUC (95% CI): 0.92 (0.83-1.00)) and risk of GC (AUC (95% CI): 0.81 (0.73-0.89) and 0.84 (0.77-0.92) for GC vs. mild or advanced gastric lesions respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/em&gt; This study revealed distinct urine proteomic profiles and a panel of proteins that may predict the progression of gastric lesions and risk of GC. These biomarkers in a non-invasive approach may have translational significance for defining high-risk populations of GC and its early detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the predominant components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and influence cancer hallmarks, but without systematic investigation on their ubiquitous characteristics across different cancer types. Here, we perform pan-cancer analysis on 226 samples across 10 solid cancer types to profile the TME at single-cell resolution, illustrating the commonalities/plasticity of heterogenous CAFs. Activation trajectory of the major CAF types is divided into three states, exhibiting distinct interactions with other cell components, and relating to prognosis of immunotherapy. Moreover, minor CAF components represent the alternative origin from other TME components (e.g., endothelia and macrophages). Particularly, the ubiquitous presentation of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition CAF, which may interact with proximal SPP1+ tumor-associated macrophages, is implicated in endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and survival stratifications. Our study comprehensively profiles the shared characteristics and dynamics of CAFs, and highlight their heterogeneity and plasticity across different cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview of ASCancer Atlas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ascancer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ASCancer Atlas&lt;/a&gt;, a comprehensive knowledgebase of alternative splicing in human cancers. In the current release, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ascancer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ASCancer Atlas&lt;/a&gt; houses about 2 million Computationally Putative Splicing Events (CPSE), covering 33 TCGA cancer types and 31 GTEx normal tissues. More importantly and distinctively, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ascancer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ASCancer Atlas&lt;/a&gt;  also builds the first repository of experimentally validated Cancer Associated Splicing Events (CASE) with established oncogenic roles summarized from extensive functional studies. A total of 2,006 high-confidence CASE with detailed functional axis were manually curated from 610 publications, involving 29 cancer primary sites and 60 human cancer subtypes. In addition, an interactive splicing visualization tool and a multiple-dimensional online splicing analysis toolkit were equipped to further explore the splicing events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ascancer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ASCancer Atlas&lt;/a&gt; provides the first knowledgebase of carcinogenic AS in human cancers, which can help users to investigate the full spectrum of splicing dysregulation in cancers and will become a value-added resource when more and more splicing variants are identified as targets for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!---more---&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental process that governs almost all aspects of cellular functions, and dysregulation in this process has been implicated in tumor initiation, progression and treatment resistance. With accumulating studies of carcinogenic mis-splicing in cancers, there is an urgent demand to integrate cancer-associated splicing changes to better understand their internal cross-talks and functional consequences from a global view. However, a resource of key functional AS events in human cancers is still lacking. To fill the gap, we developed &lt;a href=&#34;https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ascancer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ASCancer Atlas&lt;/a&gt;, a comprehensive knowledgebase of aberrant splicing in human cancers. Compared to extant databases, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ascancer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ASCancer Atlas&lt;/a&gt;  features a high-confidence collection of 2006 cancer-associated splicing events experimentally proved to promote tumorigenesis, a systematic splicing regulatory network, and a suit of multi-scale online analysis tools. For each event, we manually curated the functional axis including upstream splicing regulators, splicing event annotations, downstream oncogenic effects, and possible therapeutic strategies. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ascancer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ASCancer Atlas&lt;/a&gt; also houses about 2 million computationally putative splicing events. Additionally, a user-friendly web interface was built to enable users to easily browse, search, visualize, analyze, and download all splicing events. Overall, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ascancer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ASCancer Atlas&lt;/a&gt; provides a unique resource to study the functional roles of splicing dysregulation in human cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes are well-known key mediators of intercellular communication and contribute to various physiological and pathological processes. Their biogenesis involves four key steps, including cargo sorting, MVB formation and maturation, transport of MVBs, and MVB fusion with the plasma membrane. Each process is modulated through the competition or coordination of multiple mechanisms, whereby diverse repertoires of molecular cargos are sorted into distinct subpopulations of exosomes, resulting in the high heterogeneity of exosomes. Intriguingly, cancer cells exploit various strategies, such as aberrant gene expression, posttranslational modifications, and altered signaling pathways, to regulate the biogenesis, composition, and eventually functions of exosomes to promote cancer progression. Therefore, exosome biogenesis-targeted therapy is being actively explored. In this review, we systematically summarize recent progress in understanding the machinery of exosome biogenesis and how it is regulated in the context of cancer. In particular, we highlight pharmacological targeting of exosome biogenesis as a promising cancer therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrated proteogenomic characterization across major histological types of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pituitary neuroendocrine tumor (PitNET) is one of the most common intracranial tumors. Due to its extensive tumor heterogeneity and the lack of high-quality tissues for biomarker discovery, the causative molecular mechanisms are far from being fully defined. Therefore, more studies are needed to improve the current clinicopathological classification system, and advanced treatment strategies such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy are yet to be explored. Here, we performed the largest integrative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics analysis reported to date for a cohort of 200 PitNET patients. Genomics data indicate that GNAS copy number gain can serve as a reliable diagnostic marker for hyperproliferation of the PIT1 lineage. Proteomics-based classification of PitNETs identified 7 clusters, among which, tumors overexpressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers clustered into a more invasive subgroup. Further analysis identified potential therapeutic targets, including CDK6, TWIST1, EGFR, and VEGFR2, for different clusters. Immune subtyping to explore the potential for application of immunotherapy in PitNET identified an association between alterations in the JAK1-STAT1-PDL1 axis and immune exhaustion, and between changes in the JAK3-STAT6-FOS/JUN axis and immune infiltration. These identified molecular markers and alternations in various clusters/subtypes were further confirmed in an independent cohort of 750 PitNET patients. This proteogenomic analysis across traditional histological boundaries improves our current understanding of PitNET pathophysiology and suggests novel therapeutic targets and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Novel Protein Encoded by Exosomal CircATG4B Induces Oxaliplatin Resistance in Colorectal Cancer by Promoting Autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36285810/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxaliplatin is commonly used in chemotherapeutic regimens for colorectal cancer (CRC) after surgical resection. However, acquired chemoresistance seriously affects the curative effect in CRC patients, and the mechanism is still unclear. Here, a circular RNA, circATG4B is identified, which plays an important role in oxaliplatin resistance in CRC. circATG4B expression is found to be increased in exosomes secreted by oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells. In addition, the results suggest that circATG4B induces oxaliplatin resistance by promoting autophagy. Further in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the effect of circATG4B is attributed to its potential to encode a novel protein, circATG4B-222aa. Next, circATG4B-222aa is found to function as a decoy to competitively interact with TMED10 and prevent TMED10 from binding to ATG4B, which leads to increased autophagy followed by induction of chemoresistance. Therefore, this study reveals that exosomal circATG4B participates in the decreased chemosensitivity of CRC cells, providing a new rationale for a potential therapeutic target for oxaliplatin resistance in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DCLK1 Suppresses Tumor-Specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Function Through Recruitment of MDSCs via the CXCL1-CXCR2 Axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36309200/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36309200/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; Aims&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gastrointestinal cancer stem cell marker doublecortin-like kinase (DCLK1) is strongly associated with poor outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although DCLK1’s regulatory effect on the tumor immune microenvironment has been hypothesized, its mode of action has not been shown previously in vivo, which hampers the potential intervention based on this molecule for clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To define the immunomodulatory mechanisms of DCLK1 in vivo, we generated DCLK1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; tumor cells by Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) and developed subcutaneous and intestinal orthotopic transplantation tumor models. Tumor tissues were harvested and subjected to immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations, tumor myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) sorting by isolation kit and then co-culture with spleen T cells, and RNA sequencing for transcriptomic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that DCLK1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; tumor cells lose their tumorigenicity under immune surveillance. Failed tumor establishment of DCLK1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; was associated with an increase in infiltration of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and effector CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, and reduced numbers of MDSCs in the tumor tissue. Furthermore, DCLK1 promoted the up-regulation of C-X-C motif ligand 1, which recruits MDSCs in CRC through chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 2. The ability of in vivo tumor growth of DCLK1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; tumor cells was rescued by C-X-C motif ligand 1 overexpression. Collectively, we validated that DCLK1 promotes tumor growth in CRC through recruitment of T-cell–suppressive MDSCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DCLK1-mediated immune suppression in tumor models allows escaping from the host’s antitumor response. Because DCLK1 is one of the most common markers in gastrointestinal tumors, these results identify a precise therapeutic target for related clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting tumour-intrinsic N7-methylguanosine tRNA modification inhibits MDSC recruitment and improves anti-PD-1 efficacy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36283801/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Objective&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) exhibits very low response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. We investigate the tumour immune microenvironment (TIME) of ICCs and the underlying regulatory mechanisms with the aim of developing new target to inhibit tumour growth and improve anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Design&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Tumour tissues from patients with ICC together with hydrodynamic ICC mouse models were employed to identify the key cell population in TIME of ICCs. Functional analysis and mechanism studies were performed using cell culture, conditional knockout mouse model and hydrodynamic transfection ICC model. The efficacy of single or combined therapy with anti-PD-1 antibody, gene knockout and chemical inhibitor were evaluated in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Results&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) are enriched in advanced ICCs and significantly correlated with N&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;-methylguanosine tRNA methyltransferase METTL1. Using diverse in vivo cancer models, we demonstrate the crucial immunomodulator function of METTL1 in regulation of PMN-MDSC accumulation in TIME and ICC progression. Mechanistically, &lt;em&gt;CXCL8&lt;/em&gt; in human and &lt;em&gt;Cxcl5&lt;/em&gt; in mouse are key translational targets of METTL1 that facilitate its function in promoting PMN-MDSC accumulation in TIME and ICC progression in vivo. Co-blockade of METTL1 and its downstream chemokine pathway enhances the anti-PD-1 efficacy in ICC preclinical mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conclusions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Our data uncover novel mechanisms underlying chemokine regulation and TIME shaping at the layer of messenger RNA translation level and provide new insights for development of efficient cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intercellular transfer of activated STING triggered by RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagy promotes antitumor immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36280710/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36280710/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STING, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein, mediates innate immune activation upon cGAMP stimulation and is degraded through autophagy. Here, we report that activated STING could be transferred between cells to promote antitumor immunity, a process triggered by RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagy. Mechanistically, RAB22A engages PI4K2A to generate PI4P that recruits the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L1 complex, inducing the formation of ER-derived RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagosome, in which STING activated by agonists or chemoradiotherapy is packaged. This RAB22A-induced autophagosome fuses with RAB22A-positive early endosome, generating a new organelle that we name Rafeesome (RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagosome fused with early endosome). Meanwhile, RAB22A inactivates RAB7 to suppress the fusion of Rafeesome with lysosome, thereby enabling the secretion of the inner vesicle of the autophagosome bearing activated STING as a new type of extracellular vesicle that we define as R-EV (RAB22A-induced extracellular vesicle). Activated STING-containing R-EVs induce IFNβ release from recipient cells to the tumor microenvironment, promoting antitumor immunity. Consistently, RAB22A enhances the antitumor effect of the STING agonist diABZI in mice, and a high RAB22A level predicts good survival in nasopharyngeal cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. Our findings reveal that Rafeesome regulates the intercellular transfer of activated STING to trigger and spread antitumor immunity, and that the inner vesicle of non-canonical autophagosome originated from ER is secreted as R-EV, providing a new perspective for understanding the intercellular communication of organelle membrane proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberrant glucose metabolism is one of the most striking characteristics of metabolic reprogramming in cancer. Thus, clarifying the regulatory mechanism of glucose metabolism is crucial to understanding tumor progression and developing novel therapeutic strategies for cancer patients. Recent developments in circular RNAs have explained the regulatory mechanism of glucose metabolism from a new dimension. In this review, we briefly summarize the recent advances in circRNA research on cancer glucose metabolism and emphasize the different regulatory mechanisms, including acting as miRNA sponges, interacting with proteins and being translated into proteins. Additionally, we discuss the future research directions of circular RNAs in the field of glucose metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Splicing factor BUD31 promotes ovarian cancer progression through sustaining the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL2L12</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36271053/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulated expression of splicing factors has important roles in cancer development and progression. However, it remains a challenge to identify the cancer-specific splicing variants. Here we demonstrate that spliceosome component BUD31 is increased in ovarian cancer, and its higher expression predicts worse prognosis. We characterize the BUD31-binding motif and find that BUD31 preferentially binds exon-intron regions near splicing sites. Further analysis reveals that BUD31 inhibition results in extensive exon skipping and a reduced production of long isoforms containing full coding sequence. In particular, we identify &lt;em&gt;BCL2L12&lt;/em&gt;, an anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member, as one of the functional splicing targets of BUD31. BUD31 stimulates the inclusion of exon 3 to generate full-length &lt;em&gt;BCL2L12&lt;/em&gt; and promotes ovarian cancer progression. Knockdown of BUD31 or splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide treatment promotes exon 3 skipping and results in a truncated isoform of &lt;em&gt;BCL2L12&lt;/em&gt; that undergoes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and the cells subsequently undergo apoptosis. Our findings reveal BUD31-regulated exon inclusion as a critical factor for ovarian cancer cell survival and cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immunosuppressive lncRNA LINC00624 promotes tumor progression and therapy resistance through ADAR1 stabilization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36252997/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Despite the success of HER2-targeted therapy in achieving prolonged survival in approximately 50% of treated individuals, treatment resistance is still an important challenge for HER2+ breast cancer (BC) patients. The influence of both adaptive and innate immune responses on the therapeutic outcomes of HER2+BC patients has been extensively demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Long non-coding RNAs expressed in non-pathological complete response (pCR) HER2 positive BC were screened and validated by RNA-seq. Survival analysis were made by Kaplan-Meier method. Cell death assay and proliferation assay were performed to confirm the phenotype of LINC00624. RT-qPCR and western blot were used to assay the IFN response. Xenograft mouse model were used for in vivo confirmation of anti-neu treatment resistance. RNA pull-down and immunoblot were used to confirm the interaction of ADAR1 and LINC00624. ADAR1 recombinant protein were purified from baculovirus expression system. B16-OVA cells were used to study antigen presentation both in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometry was used to determine the tumor infiltrated immune cells of xenograft model. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were used for in vivo treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we found that LINC00624 blocked the antitumor effect of HER2- targeted therapy both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting type I interferon (IFN) pathway activation. The double-stranded RNA-like structure of LINC00624 can bind and be edited by the adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA-editing enzyme adenosine deaminase RNA specific 1 (ADAR1), and this editing has been shown to release the growth inhibition and attenuate the innate immune response caused by the IFN response. Notably, LINC00624 promoted the stabilization of ADAR1 by inhibiting its ubiquitination-induced degradation triggered by β-TrCP. In contrast, LINC00624 inhibited major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation and limited CD8+T cell infiltration in the cancer microenvironment, resulting in immune checkpoint blockade inhibition and anti-HER2 treatment resistance mediated through ADAR1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, these results suggest that LINC00624 is a cancer immunosuppressive lncRNA and targeting LINC00624 through ASOs in tumors expressing high levels of LINC00624 has great therapeutic potential in future clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel protein RASON encoded by a lncRNA controls oncogenic RAS signaling in KRAS mutant cancers</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36241718/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations of the RAS oncogene are found in around 30% of all human cancers yet direct targeting of RAS is still considered clinically impractical except for the KRAS&lt;sup&gt;G12C&lt;/sup&gt; mutant. Here we report that RAS-ON (RASON), a novel protein encoded by the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 00673 (&lt;em&gt;LINC00673&lt;/em&gt;), is a positive regulator of oncogenic RAS signaling. RASON is aberrantly overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients, and it promotes proliferation of human PDAC cell lines &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and tumor growth &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of &lt;em&gt;Rason&lt;/em&gt; in mouse embryonic fibroblasts inhibits KRAS-mediated tumor transformation. Genetic deletion of &lt;em&gt;Rason&lt;/em&gt; abolishes oncogenic KRAS-driven pancreatic and lung cancer tumorigenesis in &lt;em&gt;LSL-Kras&lt;sup&gt;G12D&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Trp53&lt;sup&gt;R172H/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Mechanistically, RASON directly binds to KRAS&lt;sup&gt;G12D/V&lt;/sup&gt; and inhibits both intrinsic and GTPase activating protein (GAP)-mediated GTP hydrolysis, thus sustaining KRAS&lt;sup&gt;G12D/V&lt;/sup&gt; in the GTP-bound hyperactive state. Therapeutically, deprivation of RASON sensitizes KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cells and patient-derived organoids to EGFR inhibitors. Our findings identify RASON as a critical regulator of oncogenic KRAS signaling and a promising therapeutic target for KRAS mutant cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting EGFR-dependent tumors by disrupting an ARF6-mediated sorting system</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36224181/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberrant activation of EGFR due to overexpression or mutation is associated with poor prognosis in many types of tumors. Here we show that blocking the sorting system that directs EGFR to plasma membrane is a potent strategy to treat EGFR-dependent tumors. We find that EGFR palmitoylation by DHHC13 is critical for its plasma membrane localization and identify ARF6 as a key factor in this process. N-myristoylated ARF6 recognizes palmitoylated EGFR via lipid-lipid interaction, recruits the exocyst complex to promote EGFR budding from Golgi, and facilitates EGFR transporting to plasma membrane in a GTP-bound form. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of this sorting system, we design a cell-permeable peptide, N-myristoylated GKVL-TAT, and find it effectively disrupts plasma membrane localization of EGFR and significantly inhibits progression of EGFR-dependent tumors. Our findings shed lights on the underlying mechanism of how palmitoylation directs protein sorting and provide an potential strategy to manage EGFR-dependent tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two circPPFIA1s negatively regulate liver metastasis of colon cancer via miR-155-5p/CDX1 and HuR/RAB36</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a critical role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, including metastasis. However, the detailed molecular mechanism is not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Differentially expressed circRNAs between primary KM12C and liver metastatic KM12L4 colon cancer cells were identified by microarray. The expression of circRNAs was measured by semi-quantitative (semi-qPCR) and real time-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Metastatic potential including invasive and migratory abilities, and liver metastasis were examined by transwell assays and intrasplenic injection, respectively. CircPPFIA1-associated microRNA (miRNA) and RNA-binding protein (RBP) were screened by an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) pulldown experiment. The effects of circPPFIA1 on target gene expression were evaluated by RT-qPCR and western blot analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; By analyzing circRNA microarray data, we identified two anti-metastatic circRNAs generated from PPFIA1 with different length, which named circPPFIA1-L (long) and -S (short). They were significantly downregulated in liver metastatic KM12L4 cells compared to primary KM12C cells. The knockdown of circPPFIA1s in KM12C enhanced metastatic potential and increased liver metastasis. Conversely, overexpression of circPPFIA1s weakened metastatic potential and inhibited liver metastasis. circPPFIA1s were found to function as sponges of oncogenic miR-155-5p and Hu antigen R (HuR) by an ASO pulldown experiment. circPPFIA1s upregulated tumor-suppressing CDX1 expression and conversely downregulated oncogenic RAB36 by decoying miR-155-5p and by sequestering HuR, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings demonstrate that circPPFIA1s inhibit the liver metastasis of CRC via the miR-155-5p/CDX1 and HuR/RAB36 pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell Transcriptomics Reveals Early Molecular and Immune Alterations Underlying the Serrated Neoplasia Pathway Toward Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36216310/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Approximately one-third of colorectal cancers develop from serrated lesions (SLs), including hyperplastic polyp (HP), sessile serrated lesion (SSL), traditional serrated adenoma (TSA), and SSL with dysplasia (SSLD) through the serrated neoplasia pathway, which progresses faster than the conventional adenoma-carcinoma pathway. We sought to depict the currently unclarified molecular and immune alterations by the single-cell landscape in SLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 16 SLs (including 4 proximal HPs, 5 SSLs, 2 SSLDs, and 5 TSAs) vs 3 normal colonic tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 60,568 high-quality cells were obtained. Two distinct epithelial clusters with redox imbalance in SLs were observed, along with upregulation of tumor-promoting SerpinB6 that regulated ROS level. Epithelial clusters of SSL and TSA showed distinct molecular features: SSL-specific epithelium manifested overexpressed proliferative markers with Notch pathway activation, whereas TSA-specific epithelium showed Paneth cell metaplasia with aberrant lysozyme expression. As for immune contexture, enhanced cytotoxic activity of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells was observed in SLs; it was mainly attributable to increased proportion of CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tissue-resident memory T cells, which might be regulated by retinoic acid metabolism. Microenvironment of SLs was generally immune-activated, whereas some immunosuppressive cells (regulatory T cells, anti-inflammatory macrophages, MDK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;IgA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; plasma cells, MMP11-secreting PDGFRA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts) also emerged at early stage and further accumulated in SSLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Epithelial, immune, and stromal components in the serrated pathway undergo fundamental alterations. Future molecular subtypes of SLs and potential immune therapy might be developed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STING-induced regulatory B cells compromise NK function in cancer immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36198789/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment is a major obstacle in the control of pancreatic and other solid cancers. Agonists of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein trigger inflammatory innate immune responses to potentially overcome tumour immunosuppression. Although these agonists hold promise as potential cancer therapies, tumour resistance to STING monotherapy has emerged in clinical trials and the mechanism(s) is unclear. Here we show that the administration of five distinct STING agonists, including cGAMP, results in an expansion of human and mouse interleukin (IL)-35&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; regulatory B cells in pancreatic cancer. Mechanistically, cGAMP drives expression of IL-35 by B cells in an IRF3-dependent but type I interferon-independent manner. In several preclinical cancer models, the loss of STING signalling in B cells increases tumour control. Furthermore, anti-IL-35 blockade or genetic ablation of IL-35 in B cells also reduces tumour growth. Unexpectedly, the STING-IL-35 axis in B cells reduces proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells and attenuates the NK-driven anti-tumour response. These findings reveal an intrinsic barrier to systemic STING agonist monotherapy and provide a combinatorial strategy to overcome immunosuppression in tumours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anoikis-Associated Lung Cancer Metastasis: Mechanisms and Therapies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36230714/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor metastasis occurs in lung cancer, resulting in tumor progression and therapy failure. Anoikis is a mechanism of apoptosis that combats tumor metastasis; it inhibits the escape of tumor cells from the native extracellular matrix to other organs. Deciphering the regulators and mechanisms of anoikis in cancer metastasis is urgently needed to treat lung cancer. Several natural and synthetic products exhibit the pro-anoikis potential in lung cancer cells and in vivo models. These products include artonin E, imperatorin, oroxylin A, lupalbigenin, sulforaphane, renieramycin M, avicequinone B, and carbenoxolone. This review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anoikis regulation and relevant regulators involved in lung cancer metastasis and discusses the therapeutic potential of targeting anoikis in the treatment of lung cancer metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the CtBP complex and FBXO11 enhances MHC class II expression and anti-cancer immune responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36179686/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CtBP complex transcriptionally represses MHC class II pathway genes in AML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FBXO11 restricts MHC class II expression by targeting CIITA for degradation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restoring MHC class II expression on leukemic blasts stimulates CD4+ T cell responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inducing tumor cell MHC class II may enhance alloSCT and immunotherapy outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is increasing recognition of the prognostic significance of tumor cell major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression in anti-cancer immunity. Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) has recently been linked to MHC class II silencing in leukemic blasts; however, the regulation of MHC class II expression remains incompletely understood. Utilizing unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we identify that the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) complex transcriptionally represses MHC class II pathway genes, while the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex component FBXO11 mediates degradation of CIITA, the principal transcription factor regulating MHC class II expression. Targeting these repressive mechanisms selectively induces MHC class II upregulation across a range of AML cell lines. Functionally, MHC class II+ leukemic blasts stimulate antigen-dependent CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell activation and potent anti-tumor immune responses, providing fundamental insights into the graft-versus-leukemia effect. These findings establish the rationale for therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring tumor-specific MHC class II expression to salvage AML relapse post-alloSCT and also potentially to enhance immunotherapy outcomes in non-myeloid malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibiting ALK-TOPK signaling pathway promotes cell apoptosis of ALK-positive NSCLC</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-LAK cell-oriented protein kinase (TOPK) is a potential therapeutic target in tumors. However, its role in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been reported. Here, we found that TOPK was highly expressed in ALK-positive NSCLC. Additionally, ALK was identified as another upstream kinase of TOPK by in vitro kinase assay screening. Then, it was proven that ALK phosphorylated TOPK at Y74 in vitro and ex vivo, and the pathways downstream of ALK-TOPK were explored by phosphoproteomic analysis. Subsequently, we demonstrated that inhibiting TOPK enhanced tumor sensitivity to alectinib (an ALK inhibitor). The combination of alectinib and HI-032 (a TOPK inhibitor) suppressed the growth and promoted the apoptosis of ALK-positive NSCLC cells ex vivo and in vivo. Our findings reveal a novel ALK-TOPK signaling pathway in ALK-positive NSCLC. The combination of alectinib and HI-032 might be a promising therapeutic strategy for improving the sensitivity of ALK-positive NSCLC to targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In vivo CRISPR screens reveal the landscape of immune evasion pathways across cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36151395/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immune system can eliminate tumors, but checkpoints enable immune escape. Here, we identify immune evasion mechanisms using genome-scale in vivo CRISPR screens across cancer models treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). We identify immune evasion genes and important immune inhibitory checkpoints conserved across cancers, including the non-classical major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) molecule Qa-1&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;/HLA-E. Surprisingly, loss of tumor interferon-γ (IFNγ) signaling sensitizes many models to immunity. The immune inhibitory effects of tumor IFN sensing are mediated through two mechanisms. First, tumor upregulation of classical MHC class I inhibits natural killer cells. Second, IFN-induced expression of Qa-1&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; inhibits CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells via the NKG2A/CD94 receptor, which is induced by ICB. Finally, we show that strong IFN signatures are associated with poor response to ICB in individuals with renal cell carcinoma or melanoma. This study reveals that IFN-mediated upregulation of classical and non-classical MHC class I inhibitory checkpoints can facilitate immune escape.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CircPAK1 promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma via modulation of YAP nucleus localization by interacting with 14-3-3ζ</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36131287/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Circular RNA (circRNA), a new class of non-coding RNA, has obvious correlations with the occurrence and development of many diseases, including tumors. This study aimed to investigate the potential roles of circPAK1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; High-throughput sequencing was performed on 3 pairs of HCC and matched normal tissues to determine the upregulated circRNAs. The expression level of circPAK1 was detected by qRT-PCR in HCC and paired with normal liver tissue samples. The effects of circPAK1 on proliferation, invasion, metastasis and apoptosis of HCC cells were evaluated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. We also constructed Chitosan/si-circPAK1 (CS/si-circPAK1) nanocomplexes using Chitosan material to evaluate its in vivo therapeutic effect on HCC. High-throughput sequencing, RNA-sequencing, RNA probe pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation and Co-Immunoprecipitation assays were performed to explore the relationship between circPAK1, 14-3-3ζ, p-LATS1 and YAP. Exosomes isolated from lenvatinib-resistant HCC cell lines were used to evaluate the relationship between exosomal circPAK1 and lenvatinib resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CircPAK1, a novel circRNA, is highly expressed in HCC tumor tissues and cell lines as well as correlated with poor outcomes in HCC patients. Functionally, circPAK1 knockdown inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis while circPAK1 overexpression promoted HCC progression. The tumor-promoting phenotypes of circPAK1 on HCC were also confirmed by animal experiments. Importantly, the application of CS/si-circPAK1 nanocomplexes showed a better therapeutic effect on tumor growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, circPAK1 enhanced HCC progression by inactivating the Hippo signaling pathway, and this kind of inactivation is based on its competitively binding of 14-3-3 ζ with YAP, which weakens the recruitment and cytoplasmic fixation of 14-3-3 ζ to YAP, thus promoting YAP nucleus localization. Additionally, circPAK1 could be transported by exosomes from lenvatinib-resistant cells to sensitive cells and induce lenvatinib resistance of receipt cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; CircPAK1 exerts its oncogenic function by competitively binding 14-3-3 ζ with YAP, thus promoting YAP nucleus localization, leading to the inactivation of a Hippo signaling pathway. Exosomal circPAK1 may drive resistance to lenvatinib, providing a potential therapeutic target for HCC patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C-reactive protein and cancer risk: a pan-cancer study of prospective cohort and Mendelian randomization analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Although observational studies have reported associations between serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration and risks of lung, breast, and colorectal cancer, inconsistent or absent evidences were showed for other cancers. We conducted a pan-cancer analysis to comprehensively assess the role of CRP, including linearity and non-linearity associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We analyzed 420,964 cancer-free participants from UK Biobank cohort. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards model was conducted to evaluate the observed correlation of CRP with overall cancer and 21 site-specific cancer risks. Furthermore, we performed linear and non-linear Mendelian randomization analyses to explore the potential causal relation between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; During a median follow-up period of 7.1 years (interquartile range: 6.3, 7.7), 34,979 incident cancer cases were observed. Observational analyses showed higher CRP concentration was associated with increased risk of overall cancer (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.02 per 1mg/L increase, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). There was a non-linear association between CRP and overall cancer risk with inflection point at 3mg/L (false-discovery rate adjust (FDR-adjusted) &lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;overall&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 and FDR-adjusted &lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;non-linear&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). For site-specific cancer, we observed positive linear associations for cancers of esophagus and stomach (FDR-adjusted &lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;overall&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.050 and FDR-adjusted &lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;non-linear&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.050). In addition, we also observed three different patterns of non-linear associations, including &amp;ldquo;fast-to-low increase&amp;rdquo; (head and neck, colorectal, liver, lung, kidney cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), &amp;ldquo;increase-to-decrease&amp;rdquo; (breast cancer), and &amp;ldquo;decrease-to-platform&amp;rdquo; (chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Furthermore, the inflection points of non-linear association patterns were consistently at around 3mg/L. By contrast, there was no evidence for linear or non-linear associations between genetically predicted CRP and risks of overall cancer or site-specific cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results indicated that CRP was a potential biomarker to assess risks of overall cancer and 12 site-specific cancers, while no association were observed for genetically-predicted CRP and cancer risks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CircSEMA4B inhibits the progression of breast cancer by encoding a novel protein SEMA4B-211aa and regulating AKT phosphorylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36115854/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating the tumorigenesis, recurrence, and metastasis of breast cancer (BC). In this study, we discovered a circRNA with protein-coding potential, which we named circSEMA4B. CircSEMA4B could encode a novel protein, SEMA4B-211aa. Both circSEMA4B and SEMA4B-211aa were remarkably downregulated in BC tissues and cell lines. Low expression of circSEMA4B was positively associated with TNM stage, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis of BC patients. The functional investigation showed that circSEMA4B and SEMA4B-211aa could significantly inhibit the proliferation and migration of BC in vivo and in vitro. Of note, SEMA4B-211aa inhibited the generation of PIP3 by binding to p85, thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT (Thr308). CircSEMA4B inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) through miR-330-3p/PDCD4 axis. Taken together, circSEMA4B is a novel negative regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, providing novel mechanistic insights into the underlying mechanisms of BC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung fibrogenic microenvironment in mouse reconstitutes human alveolar structure and lung tumor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Severe bleomycin-induced lung injury causes a significant AT2 cell loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mesenchymal cells in the fibrogenic lung supports AT2 cell proliferation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AT2 cell transplantation ameliorates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Novel orthotopic lung cancer models are established for patient-derived xenografts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mesenchymal cell activation is a hallmark event of pulmonary fibrosis. Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells are progenitor cells that maintain alveolar homeostasis, and their damage is assumed to be an initiating event for pulmonary fibrosis. However, the interaction between the lung fibrogenic microenvironment and AT2 cell dynamics remains to be elucidated. Here, we report a unique role of the lung fibrogenic microenvironment, where cell type-specific tissue reconstruction is achieved by exogenous cell transplantation. We found that in the lung fibrogenic microenvironment the AT2 cell pool was depleted, whereas mesenchymal cells could promote intact AT2 cell proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, exogenously transplanted AT2 cells formed alveolar colonies and ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis. Exogenous tumor cells formed tumor nests with relevant histological and transcriptional properties. Human primary cells were adaptable to this microenvironment, facilitating epithelial cell-targeted therapy in pulmonary fibrosis and the establishment of patient-derived xenografts for precision medicine in lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Copper-olsalazine metal-organic frameworks as a nanocatalyst and epigenetic modulator for efficient inhibition of colorectal cancer growth and metastasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36087871/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the extensive explorations of nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (nanoMOFs) in drug delivery, the intrinsic bioactivity of nanoMOFs, such as anticancer activity, is severely underestimated owing to the overlooked integration of the hierarchical components including nanosized MOFs and molecular-level organic ligands and metal-organic complexes. Herein, we propose a de novo design of multifunctional bioactive nanoMOFs ranging from molecular to nanoscale level, and demonstrate this proof-of-concept by a copper-olsalazine (Olsa, a clinically approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease, here as a bioactive linker and DNA hypomethylating agent) nanoMOF displaying a multifaceted anticancer mechanism: (1) Cu-Olsa nanoMOF-mediated redox dyshomeostasis for enhanced catalytic tumor therapy, (2) targeting downregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 by the organic complex of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Olsa, and (3) Olsa-mediated epigenetic regulation. Cu-Olsa nanoMOF displayed an enzyme-like catalytic activity to generate cancericidal species ·OH and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from rich H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in tumors, improved the expression of tumor suppressors TIMP3 and AXIN2 by epigenetic modulation, and fulfilled selective inhibition of colorectal cancer cells over normal cells. The hyaluronic acid-modified nanoMOF further verified the efficient suppression of CT26 colorectal tumor growth and metastasis in murine models. Overall, these results suggest that Olsa-based MOF presents a platform of epigenetic therapy-synergized nanomedicine for efficient cancer treatment and provides a powerful strategy for the design of intrinsically bioactive nanoMOFs. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with intrinsic bioactivities such as anticancer and antibacterial activity are of great interest. Herein, we reported a bioactive copper-olsalazine (Cu-Olsa) nanoMOF as a nanodrug for colorectal cancer treatment. This nanoMOF per se displayed enzyme-like catalytic activity to generate cancericidal species ·OH and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from rich H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in tumors for nanocatalytic tumor therapy. Upon dissociation into small molecular copper-organic complex and olsalazine in cancer cells, COX-2 inhibition and epigenetic modulation were fulfilled for selective inhibition of colorectal cancer growth and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Global burden of colorectal cancer in 2020 and 2040: incidence and mortality estimates from GLOBOCAN</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36604116/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36604116/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. The geographical and temporal burden of this cancer provides insights into risk factor prevalence and progress in cancer control strategies. We examine the current and future burden of CRC in 185 countries in 2020 and 2040.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Data on CRC cases and deaths were extracted from the GLOBOCAN database for the year 2020. Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates were calculated by sex, country, world region and Human Development Index (HDI) for 185 countries. Age-specific rates were also estimated. The predicted number of cases and deaths in 2040 were calculated based on global demographic projections by HDI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Over 1.9 million new CRC cases and 930 000 deaths were estimated in 2020. Incidence rates were highest in Australia/ New Zealand and European regions (40.6 per 100 000, males) and lowest in several African regions and Southern Asia (4.4 per 100 000, females). Similar patterns were observed for mortality rates, with the highest observed in Eastern Europe (20.2 per 100 000, males) and the lowest in Southern Asia (2.5 per 100 000, females). The burden of CRC is projected to increase to 3.2 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths by 2040 with most cases predicted to occur in high or very high HDI countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; CRC is a highly frequent cancer worldwide, and largely preventable through changes in modifiable risk factors, alongside the detection and removal of precancerous lesions. With increasing rates in transitioning countries and younger adults, there is a pressing need to better understand and act on findings to avert future cases and deaths from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles from colorectal cancer cells promote metastasis via the NOD1 signalling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36068649/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) have been shown to promote tumour metastasis via sensing tumour cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (EVs). Nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain 1 (NOD1), a cytoplasmic PRR, plays a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) by detecting bacterial products. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of NOD1, following identification of CRC cell-derived EVs (CRC-EVs), to potentiate CRC liver metastasis (CRC-LM), remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that CRC-EVs activate NOD1 in macrophages to initiate secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. NOD1-activated macrophages also promote CRC cell migration, while in a murine model of liver metastasis (LM), NOD1-deficient mice exhibit reduced metastasis following CRC-EV treatment. Furthermore, cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), a small Rho guanosine-5&amp;rsquo;-triphosphate (GTP)ase, is delivered by CRC-EVs into macrophages where it activates NOD1. In addition, EVs from the plasma of patients with CRC-LM mediate NOD1 activation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, high NOD1 expression in tumour tissues is associated with poor prognosis of CRC-LM. Our findings suggest that CRC-EVs activate NOD1 to promote tumour metastasis, thus, NOD1 may serve as a potential target in the diagnosis and treatment of CRC-LM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; circRNA has been established to play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis development in a variety of cancers; nevertheless, the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of hypoxia-induced exosomal circRNAs in pancreatic cancer remain largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Differentially expressed circRNAs in exosomes between hypoxic exosomes and normoxic exosomes in PC cells were verified by RNA sequencing. The expression of circPDK1 in PC tumors and PC patients was evaluated by qRT-PCR and ISH, and the biological functions of circPDK1 in PC were verified through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Using Western blotting, Co-IP, RNA pull-down, ChIP, RIP, dual-luciferase assays, and rescue experiments, the underlying mechanism of circPDK1 was verified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CircPDK1 was highly abundant in PC tumor tissues and serum exosomes and was associated with poor survival. Exosomal circPDK1 significantly promoted PC cell proliferation, migration, and glycolysis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circPDK1 could be activated by HIF1A at the transcriptional level and sponges miR-628-3p to activate the BPTF/c-myc axis. In addition, circPDK1 serves as a scaffold that enhances the interaction between UBE2O and BIN1, inducing the UBE2O-mediated degradation of BIN1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We found that circPDK1 was activated by HIF1A at the transcriptional level by modulating the miR-628-3p/BPTF axis and degrading BIN1. Exosomal circPDK1 is a promising biomarker for PC diagnosis and prognosis and represents a potential therapeutic target for PC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic life-long inflammatory disease affecting almost 2 million Americans. Although new biologic therapies have been developed, the standard medical treatment fails to selectively control the dysregulated immune pathways involved in chronic colonic inflammation. Further, IBD patients with uncontrolled colonic inflammation are at a higher risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Intestinal microbes can impact many immune functions, and here we asked if they could be used to improve intestinal inflammation. By utilizing an intestinal adherent &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that we find increases IL-10 producing macrophages, we were able to limit intestinal inflammation and restrict tumor formation. Macrophage IL-10 along with IL-10 signaling to the intestinal epithelium were required for protection in both inflammation and tumor development. Our work highlights that administration of immune modulating microbes can improve intestinal outcomes by altering tissue inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first-line chemotherapeutic drug for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), cisplatin (CDDP), fails to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) because it fails to induce calreticulin (CRT) exposure on the cell surface. We investigated the potential of ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R) combined with CDDP to induce ICD in lung cancer cells. The in vitro model of I/R, oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R), effectively induced CRT exposure, ATP secretion, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release and eIF2α phosphorylation in both Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and A549 cells when combined with CDDP. By using a vaccine assay and coculture with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), we showed that OGD/R restored the immunogenicity of CDDP by phosphorylating eIF2α and demonstrated that OGD/R + CDDP (O + C) is an ICD inducer. Using the inguinal tumor model, we found that I/R significantly enhanced the tumor-killing effect of CDDP and Mitomycin C, and this effect relied on adaptive antitumor immunity. Consistently, I + C altered the ratio of interferon-gamma-secreting T lymphocytes, thus overcoming the immunosuppressive effect induced by CDDP. In conclusion, our research presents a new combination strategy and indicates that I/R is a potential anticancer immunogenic modality when combined with nonimmunogenic chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In situ hybridization to detect DNA amplification in extracellular vesicles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVs have emerged as an important component in tumour initiation, progression and metastasis. Although notable progresses have been made, the detection of EV cargoes remain significantly challenging for researchers to practically use; faster and more convenient methods are required to validate the EV cargoes, especially as biomarkers. Here we show, the possibility of examining embedded EVs as substrates to be used for detecting DNA amplification through ultrasensitive in situ hybridization (ISH). This methodology allows the visualization of DNA targets in a more direct manner, without time consuming optimization steps or particular expertise. Additionally, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks of EVs allows long-term preservation of samples, permitting future studies. We report here: (i) the successful isolation of EVs from liposarcoma tissues; (ii) the EV embedding in FFPE blocks (iii) the successful selective, specific ultrasensitive ISH examination of EVs derived from tissues, cell line, and sera; (iv) and the detection of MDM2 DNA amplification in EVs from liposarcoma tissues, cell lines and sera. Ultrasensitive ISH on EVs would enable cargo study while the application of ISH to serum EVs, could represent a possible novel methodology for diagnostic confirmation. Modification of probes may enable researchers to detect targets and specific DNA alterations directly in tumour EVs, thereby facilitating detection, diagnosis, and improved understanding of tumour biology relevant to many cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phenotypic drug screen uncovers the metabolic GCH1/BH4 pathway as key regulator of EGFR/KRAS-mediated neuropathic pain and lung cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) generated in injured sensory neurons contributes to increased pain sensitivity and its persistence. GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo BH4 synthetic pathway, and human single-nucleotide polymorphism studies, together with mouse genetic modeling, have demonstrated that decreased GCH1 leads to both reduced BH4 and pain. However, little is known about the regulation of &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression upon nerve injury and whether this could be modulated as an analgesic therapeutic intervention. We performed a phenotypic screen using about 1000 bioactive compounds, many of which are target-annotated FDA-approved drugs, for their effect on regulating &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression in rodent injured dorsal root ganglion neurons. From this approach, we uncovered relevant pathways that regulate &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression in sensory neurons. We report that EGFR/KRAS signaling triggers increased &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression and contributes to neuropathic pain; conversely, inhibiting EGFR suppressed GCH1 and BH4 and exerted analgesic effects, suggesting a molecular link between EGFR/KRAS and pain perception. We also show that GCH1/BH4 acts downstream of KRAS to drive lung cancer, identifying a potentially druggable pathway. Our screen shows that pharmacologic modulation of GCH1 expression and BH4 could be used to develop pharmacological treatments to alleviate pain and identified a critical role for EGFR-regulated GCH1/BH4 expression in neuropathic pain and cancer in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNA cancer vaccines drive immunity in hard-to-treat malignancies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36168634/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36168634/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine outperforms other kinds of cancer immunotherapy due to its high response rates, easy preparation, and wide applicability, which is considered as one of the most promising forms of next-generation cancer therapies. However, the inherent instability and insufficient protein expression duration of mRNA limit the efficacy and widespread application of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we first tested the possibility of a novel circular RNA (circRNA) platform for protein expression and compare its duration with linear RNA. Then, we developed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) system for circRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo. Next, the innate and adaptive immune response of circRNA-LNP complex was evaluated in vivo. The anti-tumor efficacy of circRNA-LNP was further confirmed in three tumor models. Finally, the possibility of combination therapy with circRNA-LNP and adoptive cell transfer therapy was further investigated in a late-stage tumor model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We successfully increased the stability of the RNA vaccine by circularizing the linear RNA molecules to form highly stable circRNA molecules which exhibited durable protein expression ability. By encapsulating the antigen-coding circRNA in LNP enabling in vivo expression, we established a novel circRNA vaccine platform, which was capable of triggering robust innate and adaptive immune activation and showed superior anti-tumor efficacy in multiple mouse tumor models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, our circRNA vaccine platform provides a novel prospect for the development of cancer RNA vaccines in a wide range of hard-to-treat malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nucleolar protein NOC4L inhibits tumorigenesis and progression by attenuating SIRT1-mediated p53 deacetylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36030331/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIRT1 is an NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent deacetylase and plays an important role in the deacetylation of both histone and non-histone proteins. Many studies revealed that SIRT1 is upregulated in a variety of tumors and tightly associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression, but the detailed underlying mechanism of the biological processes remains unclarified. In the present study, we found a nucleolar protein NOC4L, human ortholog of yeast Noc4p, which is essential for the nuclear export of the ribosomal 40S subunit and could bind to SIRT1 to inhibit SIRT1 mediated deacetylation of p53. NOC4L interacts with SIRT1 in variety of cells under nucleolar stress and directly interacts with SIRT1 in vitro. Furthermore, we determined the C-terminal of NOC4L and the catalytic domain of SIRT1 were required for their interaction. Overexpression of NOC4L did not change the protein levels of SIRT1 or p53, but increased the acetylation of p53 and promoted cell apoptosis. Additionally, NOC4L inhibited tumor cell proliferation in a p53-dependent manner and restrained tumor growth in a nude mice xenograft model. Clinically, colorectal cancer patients with the high expression of NOC4L had a better prognosis as &lt;em&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt; was normally expressed, but no significant difference was observed in survival with mutant &lt;em&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt;. Taken together, our results identified a novel SIRT1 regulatory protein and broaden our understanding of the molecular mechanism of how nucleolar protein NOC4L regulates p53 under nucleolar stress. This research provides an insight into tumorigenesis and cell self-protection in the early stage of DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ALKBH5-mediated m6A modification of circCCDC134 facilitates cervical cancer metastasis by enhancing HIF1A transcription</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028854/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36028854/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Metastasis is the main cause of mortality in cervical cancer (CC). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in carcinoma biology. However, the expression and function of circRNAs in cervical cancer metastasis are still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In the present study, we identified a circRNA with an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, circCCDC134, whose expression was increased in CC tissues by circRNA-Seq and qPCR. CircCCDC134 upregulation in CC was fine-tuned by ALKBH5-mediated m6A modification, which enhanced its stability in a YTHDF2-dependent manner. The functional experiments illustrated that circCCDC134 enhanced tumour proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. For the comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins, circRNA pull-down and mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS), chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq (Chip-seq), RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) and luciferase reporter assays were used to perform mechanistic investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results revealed that circCCDC134 recruited p65 in the nucleus and acted as a miR-503-5p sponge to regulate the expression of MYB in the cytoplasm, ultimately stimulating HIF1A transcription and facilitating CC growth and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These findings indicate that circCCDC134 is an important therapeutic target and provide new regulatory model insights for exploring the carcinogenic mechanism of circCCDC134 in CC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification and validation of an anoikis-associated gene signature to predict clinical character, stemness, IDH mutation, and immune filtration in glioblastoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36091049/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36091049/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prominent and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Anoikis is a specific form of programmed cell death that plays a key role in tumor invasion and metastasis. The presence of anti-anoikis factors is associated with tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The non-negative matrix factorization algorithm was used for effective dimension reduction for integrated datasets. Differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME), stemness indices, and clinical characteristics between the two clusters were analyzed. Difference analysis, weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), univariate Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were leveraged to screen prognosis-related genes and construct a risk score model. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression of representative genes in clinical specimens. The relationship between the risk score and the TME, stemness, clinical traits, and immunotherapy response was assessed in GBM and pancancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Two definite clusters were identified on the basis of anoikis-related gene expression. Patients with GBM assigned to C1 were characterized by shortened overall survival, higher suppressive immune infiltration levels, and lower stemness indices. We further constructed a risk scoring model to quantify the regulatory patterns of anoikis-related genes. The higher risk score group was characterized by a poor prognosis, the infiltration of suppressive immune cells and a differentiated phenotype, whereas the lower risk score group exhibited the opposite effects. In addition, patients in the lower risk score group exhibited a higher frequency of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations and a more sensitive response to immunotherapy. Drug sensitivity analysis was performed, revealing that the higher risk group may benefit more from drugs targeting the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We revealed potential relationships between anoikis-related genes and clinical features, TME, stemness, IDH mutation, and immunotherapy and elucidated their therapeutic value.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://example.com/article/36082027/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have gained extensive attention for their excellent biological activity and low toxicity. However, SeNPs are extremely liable to aggregate into non-bioactive or gray elemental selenium, which limits their application in the biomedicine field. This study aimed to prepare stable SeNPs by using lentinan (LNT) as a template and evaluate its anti-colon cancer activity. The average particle diameter of obtained lentinan-selenium nanoparticles (LNT-SeNPs) was approximately 59 nm and presented zero-valent, amorphous, and spherical structures. The monodisperse SeNPs were stabilized by LNT through hydrogen bonding interactions. LNT-SeNPs solution remained highly stable at 4°C for at least 8 weeks. The stability of LNT-SeNPs solution sharply decreased under high temperature and strong acidic conditions. LNT-SeNPs showed no obvious cytotoxic effect on normal cells (IEC-6) but significantly inhibited the proliferation of five colon cancer cells (HCT-116, HT-29, Caco-2, SW620, and CT26). Among them, LNT-SeNPs exhibited the highest sensitivity toward HCT-116 cells with an IC50 value of 7.65 μM. Also, LNT-SeNPs displayed better cancer cell selectivity than sodium selenite and selenomethionine. Moreover, LNT-SeNPs promoted apoptosis of HCT-116 cells through activating mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Meanwhile, LNT-SeNPs induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in HCT-116 cells via modulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins. The results of this study indicated that LNT-SeNPs possessed strong potential application in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanoparticles: Attractive tools to treat colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36028154/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite the notable advances achieved over the last few decades, CRC remains a hard-to-treat deadly disease in many patients. This is attributed mainly to chemo- and immuno-resistance, which frequently emerge soon after treatment with conventional therapeutics. Systemic treatments are also constrained by their many undesired and serious side effects. More recently, nanomedicine has emerged as an attractive modality that can overcome issues of therapeutic resistance, improper delivery, or suboptimal targeting of tumor cells. Many nanomaterials, having already been examined in pre-clinical and clinical studies, are now considered biocompatible and relatively safe. Indeed, around 50 nano-formulations have so far been approved as diagnostic and therapeutic agents in humans. Here, in this review, we describe a set of imperative nanoparticles (NPs) involved in diagnosing and treating CRC. In particular, we discuss the theragnostic roles of quantum dots, iron oxide NPs, Polylactide-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) NPs, dendrimer NPs, carbon nanotubes, liposomes, and gold NPs. We dissect the molecular and clinical evidence supporting the use of these NPs in CRC. We also highlight their implications in targeted drug delivery as well as their anti-tumorigenic properties and effects on the cardinal hallmarks of CRC. We conclude by highlighting the notion that nanomedicine is emerging as an attractive approach to address the unmet needs in managing several diseases, including CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>scRNA-seq of gastric tumor shows complex intercellular interaction with an alternative T cell exhaustion trajectory</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35999201/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumor microenvironment (TME) in gastric cancer (GC) has been shown to be important for tumor control but the specific characteristics for GC are not fully appreciated. We generated an atlas of 166,533 cells from 10 GC patients with matched paratumor tissues and blood. Our results show tumor-associated stromal cells (TASCs) have upregulated activity of Wnt signaling and angiogenesis, and are negatively correlated with survival. Tumor-associated macrophages and LAMP3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs are involved in mediating T cell activity and form intercellular interaction hubs with TASCs. Clonotype and trajectory analysis demonstrates that Tc17 (IL-17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells) originate from tissue-resident memory T cells and can subsequently differentiate into exhausted T cells, suggesting an alternative pathway for T cell exhaustion. Our results indicate that IL17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells may promote tumor progression through IL17, IL22, and IL26 signaling, highlighting the possibility of targeting IL17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and associated signaling pathways as a therapeutic strategy to treat GC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CEP63 upregulates YAP1 to promote colorectal cancer progression through stabilizing RNA binding protein FXR1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35989368/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abnormal regulation of centrosome components can induce chromosome instability and tumorigenesis. Centrosomal protein 63 (CEP63) is a vital member for assembling centrosome. Yet, the involvement of CEP63 in cancer pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we identify CEP63 as an important mediator for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to facilitate regulation on their RNA targets in colorectal cancer (CRC). We demonstrate that CEP63 protein is upregulated in a large cohort of colorectal cancer tissues and predicts poor prognosis, and USP36 is identified for stabilizing CEP63 by enhancing its K48-dependent deubiquitination. CEP63 overexpression promotes the proliferation and tumor growth of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we find that CEP63 can promote cancer stem-like cell properties by enhancing YAP1 expression through binding with and inhibiting the K63-ubiquitylation degradation of RBP FXR1 in CRC cells. Importantly, we further verify that the KH domain of FXR1 is necessary for the interaction between CEP63 and FXR1. Moreover, microtube motor proteins can form a complex with CEP63 and FXR1 to mediate the regulation of FXR1 on RNA targets. Additionally, we also confirm that CEP63 can bind and regulate multiple RBPs. In conclusion, our findings unveil an unrecognized CEP63/RBPs/RNA axis that CEP63 may perform as an adapter facilitating the formation of RBPs complex to regulate RNA progression and discover the role of CEP63 involved in signal transduction and RNA regulation, providing potential therapeutic target for CRC patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol contributes to the structural basis of biological membranes and functions as a signaling molecule, whose dysregulation has been associated with various human diseases. Here, we report that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SNHG6 increases progression from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by modulating cholesterol-induced mTORC1 activation. Mechanistically, cholesterol binds ER-anchored FAF2 protein to promote the formation of a SNHG6-FAF2-mTOR complex. As a putative cholesterol effector, SNHG6 enhances cholesterol-dependent mTORC1 lysosomal recruitment and activation via enhancing FAF2-mTOR interaction at ER-lysosome contacts, thereby coordinating mTORC1 kinase cascade activation with cellular cholesterol biosynthesis in a self-amplified cycle to accelerate cholesterol-driven NAFLD-HCC development. Notably, loss of SNHG6 inhibits mTORC1 signaling and impairs growth of patient-derived xenograft liver cancer tumors, identifyifng SNHG6 as a potential target for liver cancer treatment. Together, our findings illustrate the crucial role of organelle-associated lncRNA in organelle communication, nutrient sensing, and kinase cascades.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>p52-ZER6: a determinant of tumor cell sensitivity to MDM2-p53 binding inhibitors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting MDM2-p53 interaction has emerged as a promising antitumor therapeutic strategy. Several MDM2-p53 inhibitors have advanced into clinical trials, but results are not favorable. The lack of appropriate biomarkers for selecting patients has been assumed as the critical reason for this failure. We previously identified ZER6 isoform p52-ZER6 as an oncogene upregulated in tumor tissues. In this study we investigated whether p52-ZER6 acted as a blocker of MDM2-p53 binding inhibitors, and whether p52-ZER6 could be used as a biomarker of MDM2-p53 binding inhibitors. In p53 wild-type colorectal carcinoma HCT116, hepatocarcinoma HepG2 and breast cancer MCF-7 cells, overexpression of p52-ZER6 enhanced MDM2-p53 binding and promoted p53 ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, overexpression of p52-ZER6 in the tumor cells dose-dependently reduced their sensitivity to both nutlin and non-nutlin class MDM2-p53 binding inhibitors. We showed that p52-ZER6 restored tumor cell viability, which was suppressed by nutlin-3, through restoring their proliferation potential while suppressing their apoptotic rate, suggesting that MDM2-p53 binding inhibitors might not be effective for patients with high p52-ZER6 levels. We found that nutlin-3 treatment or p52-ZER6 knockdown alone promoted the accumulation of p53 protein in the tumor cells, and their combinatorial treatment significantly increased the accumulation of p53 protein. In HCT116 cell xenograft nude mouse model, administration of shp52-ZER6 combined with an MDM2-p53 binding inhibitor nutlin-3 exerted synergistic antitumor response. In conclusion, this study reveals that p52-ZER6 might be a potential biomarker for determining patients appropriate for MDM2-p53 binding inhibition-based antitumor therapy, and demonstrates the potential of combinatorial therapy using MDM2-p53 binding inhibitors and p52-ZER6 inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>METTL3 potentiates progression of cervical cancer by suppressing ER stress via regulating m6A modification of TXNDC5 mRNA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N6-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) is the most abundant chemical modification on mRNA and plays significant roles in many bioprocesses. However, the functions of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A on cervical cancer (CC) tumorigenesis remain unclear. Here we found methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), a core member of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methyltransferase family, was greatly upregulated as an independent prognostic factor in CC. Mechanistically, the transcription factor ETS1 recruited P300 and WDR5 which separately mediated H3K27ac and H3K4me3 histone modification in the promoter of METTL3 and induced METTL3 transcription activation. Furthermore, we identified TXNDC5 as a target of METTL3-mediated m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification through MeRIP-seq, and revealed that METTL3-mediated TXNDC5 expression relied on the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A reader-dependent manner. Functionally, we verified that METTL3 promoted proliferation and metastasis of CC cells by regulating of TXNDC5 expression through in vitro and in vivo experiments. In addition, our study verified the effect of METTL3/TXNDC5 axis on ER stress. Taken together, METTL3 facilitates the malignant progression of CC, suggesting that METTL3 might be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for CC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transposon-activated POU5F1B promotes colorectal cancer growth and metastasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35987910/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) is an unmet medical need in absence of early diagnosis. Here, upon characterizing cancer-specific transposable element-driven transpochimeric gene transcripts (TcGTs) produced by this tumor in the SYSCOL cohort, we find that expression of the hominid-restricted retrogene POU5F1B through aberrant activation of a primate-specific endogenous retroviral promoter is a strong negative prognostic biomarker. Correlating this observation, we demonstrate that POU5F1B fosters the proliferation and metastatic potential of CRC cells. We further determine that POU5F1B, in spite of its phylogenetic relationship with the POU5F1/OCT4 transcription factor, is a membrane-enriched protein that associates with protein kinases and known targets or interactors as well as with cytoskeleton-related molecules, and induces intracellular signaling events and the release of trans-acting factors involved in cell growth and cell adhesion. As POU5F1B is an apparently non-essential gene only lowly expressed in normal tissues, and as POU5F1B-containing TcGTs are detected in other tumors besides CRC, our data provide interesting leads for the development of cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNA circFIRRE drives osteosarcoma progression and metastasis through tumorigenic-angiogenic coupling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35986280/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35986280/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointing clinical efficacy of standard treatment has been proven in refractory metastatic osteosarcoma, and the emerging anti-angiogenic regimens are still in the infantile stage. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic approach for osteosarcoma lung metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;circFIRRE was selected from RNA-sequencing of 4 matched osteosarcoma and adjacent samples. The expression of circFIRRE was verified in clinical osteosarcoma samples and cell lines via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The effect of circFIRRE was investigated in cell lines in vitro models, ex vivo models and in vivo xenograft tumor models, including proliferation, invasion, migration, metastasis and angiogenesis. Signaling regulatory mechanism was evaluated by RT-qPCR, Western blot, RNA pull-down and dual-luciferase reporter assays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, a novel circular RNA, circFIRRE (hsa_circ_0001944) was screened out and identified from RNA-sequencing, and was upregulated in both osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues. Clinically, aberrantly upregulated circFIRRE portended higher metastatic risk and worse prognosis in osteosarcoma patients. Functionally, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experiments demonstrated that circFIRRE could drive primary osteosarcoma progression and lung metastasis by inducing both tumor cells and blood vessels, we call as “tumorigenic-angiogenic coupling”. Mechanistically, upregulated circFIRRE was induced by transcription factor YY1, and partially boosted the mRNA and protein level of LUZP1 by sponging miR-486-3p and miR-1225-5p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified circFIRRE as a master regulator in the tumorigenesis and angiogenesis of osteosarcoma, which could be purposed as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for refractory osteosarcoma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypoxia-induced lncRNA STEAP3-AS1 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote colorectal cancer progression by preventing m6A-mediated degradation of STEAP3 mRNA</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35986274/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35986274/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Hypoxia, a typical hallmark of solid tumors, exhibits an essential role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), in which the dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is frequently observed. However, the underlying mechanisms are not clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The TCGA database was analyzed to identify differential lncRNA expression involved in hypoxia-induced CRC progression. qRT-PCR was conducted to validate the upregulation of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; in CRC cell lines and tumor-bearing mouse and zebrafish models under hypoxia. ChIP-qRT-PCR was used to detect the transcriptional activation of STEAP3-AS1 mediated by HIF-1α. RNA-seq, fluorescent in situ hybridization, RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and immunoblot experiments were used to ascertain the involved mechanisms. Functional assays were performed in both in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the regulatory role of &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt;/STEAP3/Wnt/β-catenin axis in CRC proliferation and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Here, we identified a hypoxia-induced antisense lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; that was highly expressed in clinical CRC tissues and positively correlated with poor prognosis of CRC patients. Upregulation of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt;, which was induced by HIF-1α-mediated transcriptional activation, facilitated the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; interacted competitively with the YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2), a N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) reader, leading to the disassociation of YTHDF2 with &lt;em&gt;STEAP3&lt;/em&gt; mRNA. This effect protected &lt;em&gt;STEAP3&lt;/em&gt; mRNA from m6A-mediated degradation, enabling the high expression of STEAP3 protein and subsequent production of cellular ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). Increased Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels elevated Ser 9 phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and inhibited its kinase activity, thus releasing β-catenin for nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of Wnt signaling to support CRC progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Taken together, our study highlights the mechanisms of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; in facilitating CRC progression involving the &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt;/STEAP3/Wnt/β-catenin axis, which may provide novel diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets to benefit CRC treatment. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1α transcriptionally upregulates the expression of lncRNA STEAP3-AS1, which interacts competitively with YTHDF2, thus upregulating mRNA stability of STEAP3 and consequent STEAP3 protein expression. The enhanced STEAP3 expression results in production of cellular ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), which induces the Ser 9 phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β, releasing β-catenin for nuclear translocation and contributing to subsequent activation of Wnt signaling to promote CRC progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LINC00941 promotes pancreatic cancer malignancy by interacting with ANXA2 and suppressing NEDD4L-mediated degradation of ANXA2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35977942/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35977942/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been proven to regulate pancreatic cancer (PC) progression. We aimed to explore the pathogenesis of LINC00941 in PC regarding protein binding. By using PCR analysis, we found that LINC00941 was overexpressed in PC tissues and was higher in patients with liver metastasis than in patients without liver metastasis. In addition, high LINC00941 expression was associated with a poor prognosis. Functional experiments and mice models were respectively used to evaluate PC cell proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo. The results suggested that LINC00941 overexpression promoted PC proliferation and metastasis. Subsequently, RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry (MS), and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) were performed to identify LINC00941-interacting proteins. The results suggested that ANXA2 was the potential LINC00941-interacting protein. Nucleotides 500-1390 of LINC00941 could bind to the Annexin 1 domain of ANXA2. LINC00941-mediated malignant phenotype of PC was reversed by ANXA2 depletion. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by MS was conducted to determine the potential interacting protein of LINC00941. The results illustrated that NEDD4L, an E3 ligase involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, bound to the Annexin 1 domain of ANXA2 and promoted its degradation. Mechanically, LINC00941 functioned as a decoy to bind to ANXA2 and suppressed its degradation by enclosing the domain that binds to NEDD4L. Eventually, LINC00941 upregulated ANXA2 and activated FAK/AKT signaling, increasing PC cell proliferation and metastasis. This study indicates that LINC00941 promotes PC proliferation and metastasis by binding ANXA2 and potentiating its stability, leading to the activation of FAK/AKT signaling. Our data demonstrate that LINC00941 may serve as a novel target for prognosis and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel long noncoding RNA SP100-AS1 induces radioresistance of colorectal cancer via sponging miR-622 and stabilizing ATG3</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35978049/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although radiotherapy is an essential modality in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), the incidence of radioresistance remains high clinically. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) reportedly play critical roles in CRC radioresistance by regulating genes or proteins at the transcriptional or post-translational levels. This study aimed to identify novel lncRNAs involved in radioresistance. We found that SP100-AS1 (lncRNA targeting antisense sequence of SP100 gene) was upregulated in radioresistant CRC patient tissues using RNA-seq analysis. Importantly, knockdown of SP100-AS1 significantly reduced radioresistance, cell proliferation, and tumor formation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analyses were used to identify the interacting proteins and microRNAs of SP100-AS1, respectively. Moreover, SP100-AS1 was found to interact with and stabilize ATG3 protein through the ubiquitination-dependent proteasome pathway. In addition, it could serve as a sponge for miR-622, which targeted ATG3 mRNA and affected autophagic activity. Thus, lncRNA SP100-AS1 could act as a radioresistance factor in CRC patients via RNA sponging and protein stabilizing mechanisms. In conclusion, the present study indicates that SP100-AS1/miR-622/ATG3 axis contributes to radioresistance and autophagic activity in CRC patients, suggesting it has huge prospects as a therapeutic target for improving CRC response to radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adipocyte-Derived Exosomal MTTP Suppresses Ferroptosis and Promotes Chemoresistance in Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35978266/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity is closely related to a poor prognosis in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), but the mechanisms remain unclear. Ferroptosis is a form of nonapoptotic cell death characterized by lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and iron dependency and is associated with the chemoresistance of tumors. Here, it is shown that adipose-derived exosomes reduce ferroptosis susceptibility in CRC, thus promoting chemoresistance to oxaliplatin. It is found that microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) expression is increased in the plasma exosomes of CRC patients with a high body fat ratio, serving as an inhibitor of ferroptosis and reducing sensitivity to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, the MTTP/proline-rich acidic protein 1 (PRAP1) complex inhibited zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 expression and upregulated glutathione peroxidase 4 and xCT, leading to a decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio and lipid ROS levels. Moreover, experiments are carried out in organoids, and a tumor implantation model is established in obese mice, demonstrating that the inhibition of MTTP increases the sensitivity to chemotherapy. The results reveal a novel intracellular signaling pathway mediated by adipose-derived exosomes and suggest that treatments targeting secreted MTTP might reverse oxaliplatin resistance in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumour-associated macrophages are an essential component of the tumour microenvironment and have a role in the orchestration of angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodelling, cancer cell proliferation, metastasis and immunosuppression, as well as in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Conversely, when appropriately activated, macrophages can mediate phagocytosis of cancer cells and cytotoxic tumour killing, and engage in effective bidirectional interactions with components of the innate and adaptive immune system. Therefore, they have emerged as therapeutic targets in cancer therapy. Macrophage-targeting strategies include inhibitors of cytokines and chemokines involved in the recruitment and polarization of tumour-promoting myeloid cells as well as activators of their antitumorigenic and immunostimulating functions. Early clinical trials suggest that targeting negative regulators (checkpoints) of myeloid cell function indeed has antitumor potential. Finally, given the continuous recruitment of myelomonocytic cells into tumour tissues, macrophages are candidates for cell therapy with the development of chimeric antigen receptor effector cells. Macrophage-centred therapeutic strategies have the potential to complement, and synergize with, currently available tools in the oncology armamentarium.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serine metabolism is a key driver of 5-FU acquired resistance in CRC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affecting serine availability impairs DNA damage response in 5-FU-resistant cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitochondrial compartmentalization of serine metabolism sustains 5-FU resistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting mitochondrial serine metabolism is effective in overcoming 5-FU resistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a key component of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC). 5-FU efficacy is established by intracellular levels of folate cofactors and DNA damage repair strategies. However, drug resistance still represents a major challenge. Here, we report that alterations in serine metabolism affect 5-FU sensitivity in in vitro and in vivo CRC models. In particular, 5-FU-resistant CRC cells display a strong serine dependency achieved either by upregulating endogenous serine synthesis or increasing exogenous serine uptake. Importantly, regardless of the serine feeder strategy, serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2)-driven compartmentalization of one-carbon metabolism inside the mitochondria represents a specific adaptation of resistant cells to support purine biosynthesis and potentiate DNA damage response. Interfering with serine availability or affecting its mitochondrial metabolism revert 5-FU resistance. These data disclose a relevant mechanism of mitochondrial serine use supporting 5-FU resistance in CRC and provide perspectives for therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role, mechanism, and application of RNA methyltransferase METTL14 in gastrointestinal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35974338/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gastrointestinal cancer is the most common human malignancy characterized by high lethality and poor prognosis. Emerging evidences indicate that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant post-transcriptional modification in eukaryotes, exerts important roles in regulating mRNA metabolism including stability, decay, splicing, transport, and translation. As the key component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) catalyzes m6A methylation on mRNA or non-coding RNA to regulate gene expression and cell phenotypes. Dysregulation of METTL14 was deemed to be involved in various aspects of gastrointestinal cancer, such as tumorigenesis, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis. Plenty of findings have opened up new avenues for exploring the therapeutic potential of gastrointestinal cancer targeting METTL14. In this review, we systematically summarize the recent advances regarding the biological functions of METTL14 in gastrointestinal cancer, discuss its potential clinical applications and propose the research forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNA circSFMBT2 downregulation by HBx promotes hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis via the miR-665/TIMP3 axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36159591/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is considered as an oncogene in tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In recent years, the important role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in HCC has been increasingly demonstrated. However, the regulatory mechanisms of HBx on circRNAs remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified that a novel circRNA, circSFMBT2, was markedly downregulated by HBx. Low expression of circSFMBT2 was correlated with poor prognosis and vascular invasion. Functionally, overexpression of circSFMBT2 significantly inhibited HCC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of circSFMBT2 was to as a sponge of miR-665, which is a negative regulator of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3). However, HBx downregulated circSFMBT2 via the interaction with DExH-box helicase 9 (DHX9), which binds to flanking circRNA-forming introns. In conclusion, circSFMBT2, which is downregulated by HBx, acts as a tumor suppressor to inhibit tumor metastasis through the miR-665/TIMP3 axis. Our study suggests that circSFMBT2 could be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-192-5p/RB1/NF-κBp65 signaling axis promotes IL-10 secretion during gastric cancer EMT to induce Treg cell differentiation in the tumour microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35969010/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35969010/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Regulatory T (Treg) cells are important components of the tumour microenvironment (TME) that play roles in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. Although tumour cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulate Treg cell function, their regulatory mechanism in GC remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The miR-192-5p was identified by examining three Gene Expression Omnibus GC miRNA expression datasets. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted to identify interactions between miR-192-5p and RB1. The role of miR-192-5p/RB1 in GC progression was evaluated based on EdU incorporation, wound healing and Transwell assays. An in vitro co-culture assay was performed to measure the effect of miR-192-5p/RB1 on Treg cell differentiation. In vivo experiments were conducted to explore the role of miR-192-5p in GC progression and Treg cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MiR-192-5p was overexpressed in tumour and was associated with poor prognosis in GC. MiR-192-5p bound to the RB1 3&amp;rsquo;-untranslated region, resulting in GC EMT, proliferation, migration and invasion. MiR-192-5p/RB1 mediated interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion by regulating nuclear factor-kappaBp65 (NF-κBp65), affecting Treg cell differentiation. NF-κBp65, in turn, promoted miR-192-5p expression and formed a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that miR-192-5p/RB1 promotes GC growth and Treg cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, our studies indicate that miR-192-5p/RB1 promotes EMT of tumour cells, and the miR-192-5p/RB1/NF-κBp65 signaling axis induces Treg cell differentiation by regulating IL-10 secretion in GC. Our results suggest that targeting miR-192-5p/RB1/NF-κBp65 /IL-10 may pave the way for the development of new immune treatments for GC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>lncRNA CYTOR promotes aberrant glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration via HNRNPC-mediated ZEB1 stabilization in oral squamous cell carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35963855/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the most common malignancy of the oral and maxillofacial region, severely affects human health. However, current treatments for OSCC commonly show only a ~60% 5-year survival rate of patients with distant metastases, indicating an urgent need for targeted treatments for patients with advanced metastases. Here, we report a survival-related long non-coding RNA, CYTOR, which is highly expressed in the lesions of oral cancer patients. We found that CYTOR can promote both migration and invasion in oral cancer cells as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). RNA-sequencing of CYTOR-knockdown oral cancer cells revealed that CYTOR can regulate mitochondrial respiration and RNA splicing. Mechanistically, we found that nuclear-localized CYTOR interacts with HNRNPC, resulting in stabilization of ZEB1 mRNAs by inhibiting the nondegradative ubiquitination of HNRNPC. By synthesizing CYTOR-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) encapsulated in Nanoscale Metal Organic Frameworks (NMOFs), we demonstrate the targeted suppression of CYTOR to inhibit invasion and metastasis of oral cancer cells in a nude mouse model. Cumulatively, this study reveals the potential role of the CYTOR-HNRNPC-ZEB1 axis in regulating mitochondrial metabolism and glycolysis of oral cancer cells, and illustrates the effective use of lncRNA targeting in anti-metastatic cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrated metagenomic and metabolomic analysis reveals distinct gut-microbiome-derived phenotypes in early-onset colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35953094/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC) is steadily increasing. Here, we aimed to characterise the interactions between gut microbiome, metabolites and microbial enzymes in EO-CRC patients and evaluate their potential as non-invasive biomarkers for EO-CRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design:&lt;/em&gt; We performed metagenomic and metabolomic analyses, identified multiomics markers and constructed CRC classifiers for the discovery cohort with 130 late-onset CRC (LO-CRC), 114 EO-CRC subjects and age-matched healthy controls (97 LO-Control and 100 EO-Control). An independent cohort of 38 LO-CRC, 24 EO-CRC, 22 LO-Controls and 24 EO-Controls was analysed to validate the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with controls, reduced alpha-diversity was apparent in both, LO-CRC and EO-CRC subjects. Although common variations existed, integrative analyses identified distinct microbiome-metabolome associations in LO-CRC and EO-CRC. &lt;em&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; enrichment and short-chain fatty acid depletion, including reduced microbial GABA biosynthesis and a shift in acetate/acetaldehyde metabolism towards acetyl-CoA production characterises LO-CRC. In comparison, multiomics signatures of EO-CRC tended to be associated with enriched &lt;em&gt;Flavonifractor plauti&lt;/em&gt; and increased tryptophan, bile acid and choline metabolism. Notably, elevated red meat intake-related species, choline metabolites and KEGG orthology (KO) pldB and cbh gene axis may be potential tumour stimulators in EO-CRC. The predictive model based on metagenomic, metabolomic and KO gene markers achieved a powerful classification performance for distinguishing EO-CRC from controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our large-sample multiomics data suggest that altered microbiome-metabolome interplay helps explain the pathogenesis of EO-CRC and LO-CRC. The potential of microbiome-derived biomarkers as promising non-invasive tools could be used for the accurate detection and distinction of individuals with EO-CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disruption of the circadian clock drives Apc loss of heterozygosity to accelerate colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alarming rise in young onset colorectal cancer (CRC) has been reported; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains undefined. Suspected risk factors of young onset CRC include environmental aspects, such as lifestyle and dietary factors, which are known to affect the circadian clock. We find that both genetic disruption and environmental disruption of the circadian clock accelerate &lt;em&gt;Apc&lt;/em&gt;-driven CRC pathogenesis in vivo. Using an intestinal organoid model, we demonstrate that clock disruption promotes transformation by driving &lt;em&gt;Apc&lt;/em&gt; loss of heterozygosity, which hyperactivates Wnt signaling. This up-regulates &lt;em&gt;c-Myc&lt;/em&gt;, a known Wnt target, which drives heightened glycolytic metabolism. Using patient-derived organoids, we show that circadian rhythms are lost in human tumors. Last, we identify that variance between core clock and Wnt pathway genes significantly predicts the survival of patients with CRC. Overall, our findings demonstrate a previously unidentified mechanistic link between clock disruption and CRC, which has important implications for young onset cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DLGAP1-AS2-Mediated Phosphatidic Acid Synthesis Activates YAP Signaling and Confers Chemoresistance in Squamous Cell Carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35731019/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) constitute a group of human malignancies that originate from the squamous epithelium. Most patients with SCC experience treatment failure and relapse and have a poor prognosis due to de novo and acquired resistance to first-line chemotherapeutic agents. To identify chemoresistance mechanisms and to explore novel targets for chemosensitization, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of paired resistant and parental SCC cells. We identified DLGAP1 antisense RNA 2 (D-AS2) as a crucial noncoding RNA that contributes to chemoresistance in SCC. Mechanistically, D-AS2 affected chromatin accessibility around the histone mark H3K27ac of FAM3 metabolism regulating signaling molecule D (FAM3D), reducing FAM3D mRNA transcription and extracellular protein secretion. FAM3D interacted with the Gαi-coupled G protein-coupled receptors formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) and FPR2 to suppress phospholipase D (PLD) activity, and reduced FAM3D increased PLD signaling. Moreover, activated PLD promoted phosphatidic acid (PA) production and subsequent nuclear translocation of yes-associated protein (YAP). Accordingly, in vivo administration of a D-AS2-targeting antisense oligonucleotide sensitized SCC to cisplatin treatment. In summary, this study shows that D-AS2/FAM3D-mediated PLD/PA lipid signaling is essential for SCC chemoresistance, suggesting D-AS2 can be targeted to sensitize SCC to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MNX1-AS1 expression is upregulated in GBC and predicts poor prognosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overexpression of MNX1-AS1 facilitates the proliferation and metastasis of GBC cells in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MNX1-AS1 acts as a scaffold for recruiting USP16 to stabilize IGF2BP3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MNX1-AS1/IGF2BP3/Hippo pathway positive feedback loop contributes to GBC progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in multiple human cancers, which may offer great potential as putative targets for cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, the roles of most lncRNAs in gallbladder cancer (GBC) remain poorly understood. The objective of this research involves investigating the clinical implications and underlying mechanism of lncRNA motor neuron and pancreas homeobo×1 antisense RNA 1 (MNX1-AS1) in GBC. This study shows that MNX1-AS1 expression is elevated in the tissues of GBC patients, and is strongly associated with reduced patient survival. Functionally, MNX1-AS1 significantly stimulates the proliferation and metastasis of GBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MNX1-AS1 is transcriptionally activated by TEA domain family member 4 (TEAD4), and suppresses insulin-like growing factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) degradation by recruiting ubiquitin specific peptidase 16 (USP16). Furthermore, MNX1-AS1/IGF2BP3 axis inhibits the Hippo signaling pathway and subsequently activates TEAD4, thereby forming a positive feedback loop. According to our results, MNX1-AS1 facilitates tumorigenesis, progression and metastasis of GBC through a MNX1-AS1/IGF2BP3/Hippo pathway positive feedback loop, which could be both diagnostically and therapeutically helpful in GBC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Vivo Genome-Wide CRISPR Activation Screening Identifies Functionally Important Long Noncoding RNAs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35944892/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are found to have profound impacts on diverse cellular processes. Although high-throughput sequencing studies have shown the differential lncRNA expression profiles between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and nontumor livers, the functional impacts of lncRNAs on HCC development await further investigation. Herein, we sought to address the functional roles of lncRNAs in HCC pathogenesis by in vivo functional screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We performed genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/dead CRISPR-associated protein 9 (dCas9) lncRNA activation screening in HCC xenografts. We characterized the clinical relevance of positively selected lncRNAs using transcriptomic data sets. We used CRISPR-based gene activation and knockdown approaches to show the functional roles of positively selected lncRNAs including Cancer Susceptibility 11 (CASC11) in HCC. RNA sequencing and chromatin isolation by RNA purification sequencing were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of CASC11 in HCC progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The in vivo functional screening identified 1603 positively selected lncRNAs, 538 of which were overexpressed in HCC patients. Systematic transcriptomic data analysis and clinical investigation showed that patients with high expression of these lncRNA candidates correlated with aggressive tumor behaviors. Overexpression of these lncRNAs aggravated HCC cell growth. Detailed characterization of a lncRNA candidate, CASC11, showed its pivotal role in cell proliferation and tumor growth. Mechanistically, chromatin isolation by RNA purification sequencing showed that CASC11 was bound to the CASC11/MYC proto-oncogene shared promoter region on chromosome 8q24. CASC11 modulated the transcriptional activity of MYC in a cis-regulatory manner, which affected the expression of MYC downstream target genes, consequently promoting G1/S progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study showed the power of in vivo CRISPR screening, which comprehensively investigated the functionality of lncRNAs in HCC progression, providing a rationale for targeting these lncRNAs clinically.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular characterization of colorectal cancer related peritoneal metastatic disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant proportion of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop peritoneal metastases (PM) in the course of their disease. PMs are associated with a poor quality of life, significant morbidity and dismal disease outcome. To improve care for this patient group, a better understanding of the molecular characteristics of CRC-PM is required. Here we present a comprehensive molecular characterization of a cohort of 52 patients. This reveals that CRC-PM represent a distinct CRC molecular subtype, CMS4, but can be further divided in three separate categories, each presenting with unique features. We uncover that the CMS4-associated structural protein Moesin plays a key role in peritoneal dissemination. Finally, we define specific evolutionary features of CRC-PM which indicate that polyclonal metastatic seeding underlies these lesions. Together our results suggest that CRC-PM should be perceived as a distinct disease entity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PARP inhibitor plus radiotherapy reshapes an inflamed tumor microenvironment that sensitizes small cell lung cancer to the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PARPI plus radiation further activated cGAS/STING pathway than single treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PARPI plus radiation upregulated the expression of PD-L1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PARPI plus radiation sensitizes small cell lung cancer to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly malignant tumor with extremely poor prognosis. The treatment strategy is very limited, and patient outcomes remain dismal with the 5-year survival rate being mere 3-6%. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies for SCLC patients are urgently needed. In this study, we found that the triple-therapy of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, radiotherapy (RT) and anti-PD-1 treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival in the syngeneic SCLC models in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the combination of PARP inhibitor niraparib and RT reshaped an inflamed tumor microenvironment, including activation of the cGAS/STING immune response pathway, induction of immunogenic cell death, and upregulation of PD-L1 on tumor cells. Furthermore, this triple-therapy substantially augmented CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation, and enhanced anti-tumor effects as revealed by increased median survival time and reduced tumor volume without additional myelosuppression or hepatic injury. Together, our studies demonstrated that PARP inhibitor combined with RT potentiated anti-tumor immunity and enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in preclinical study, which provided a promising therapeutic strategy for SCLC patients in clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long non‑coding RNA CASC11 interacts with YBX1 to promote prostate cancer progression by suppressing the p53 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35904175/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the principal causes of cancer‑related death worldwide. The roles and mechanisms of long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) involved in the development of PCa remain incompletely understood. The present study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of lncRNA in PCa tumorigenesis. In the present study, lncRNA cancer susceptibility candidate 11 (CASC11) was revealed to be a crucial regulator of PCa progression. The expression profiles of CASC11 in PCa were identified through analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus datasets, and validated in human PCa specimens and cell lines. Gain‑ and loss‑of‑function assays were utilized to explore the biological role of CASC11 in PCa initiation and progression. RNA‑sequencing, RNA pull‑down and RNA immunoprecipitation analyses were used to explore potential mechanisms with which CASC11 may be associated. Rescue experiments were further conducted to confirm this association. The present results revealed that CASC11 was dominantly distributed in the nuclei of PCa cells, and was highly expressed in PCa tissues and cells. Overexpression of CASC11 was markedly associated with increased tumor proliferation and migratory ability. Functionally, decreased proliferation and migration, as well as inhibited xenograft tumor growth, were observed in CASC11‑silenced PCa cells, whereas the opposite effects were detected in CASC11‑overexpressing cells. Mechanistically, CASC11 promoted progression of the cell cycle and competitively interacted with Y‑box binding protein 1 (YBX1) to block the p53 pathway. Given this, poly (β‑amino ester) (PBAE)/small interfering RNA‑CASC11 (si‑CASC11) nanoparticles were applied to inhibit CASC11 expression and enhance the antitumor effect in vivo. The results revealed that PBAE/si‑CASC11 nanoparticles augmented the antitumor efficacy of CASC11 knockdown in vivo. In conclusion, the present study suggested that CASC11 may regulate PCa progression and elucidated a novel CASC11/YBX1/p53 signaling axis, providing a potential lncRNA‑directed therapeutic strategy particularly for the treatment of patients with PCa.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metabolic balance in colorectal cancer is maintained by optimal Wnt signaling levels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35904277/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wnt pathways are important for the modulation of tissue homeostasis, and their deregulation is linked to cancer development. Canonical Wnt signaling is hyperactivated in many human colorectal cancers due to genetic alterations of the negative Wnt regulator APC. However, the expression levels of Wnt-dependent targets vary between tumors, and the mechanisms of carcinogenesis concomitant with this Wnt signaling dosage have not been understood. In this study, we integrate whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screens with large-scale multi-omic data to delineate functional subtypes of cancer. We engineer APC loss-of-function mutations and thereby hyperactivate Wnt signaling in cells with low endogenous Wnt activity and find that the resulting engineered cells have an unfavorable metabolic equilibrium compared with cells which naturally acquired Wnt hyperactivation. We show that the dosage level of oncogenic Wnt hyperactivation impacts the metabolic equilibrium and the mitochondrial phenotype of a given cell type in a context-dependent manner. These findings illustrate the impact of context-dependent genetic interactions on cellular phenotypes of a central cancer driver mutation and expand our understanding of quantitative modulation of oncogenic signaling in tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles as an emerging drug delivery system for cancer treatment: Current strategies and recent advances</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer is one of the primary causes of death worldwide, and its morbidity and mortality rates are increasing rapidly. However, standard treatment modalities (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy) often fail to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic effect. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural nano-sized lipid bilayer vesicles secreted from cells. Owing to their advantages of low toxicity, high biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and inherent targeting, EVs can be exploited as drug delivery vectors for cancer treatment. In this review, we summarize the research progress of EV-based drug delivery systems in cancer treatment by focusing on four aspects: sources, cargo types, cargo loading methods and modification strategies. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gut microbes participate in pathogenesis by interacting with the host genome through epigenetic mechanisms, such as long non-coding RNAs. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiota induce expression alteration of long non-coding RNAs remains unclear. Here, we quantified the transcriptome alteration of human colon cell lines after being infected by a common enteric pathogen &lt;em&gt;Salmonella typhimurium SL1344&lt;/em&gt;. We observed a widespread lncRNAs expression alteration. Among them, the elevated expression of LINC00152 was verified and proved to be induced by enteric bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The inducible LINC00152 were found to inhibit Salmonella invasion and inflammation response. LINC00152 was overexpressed in tumors of the clinical CRC samples compared with adjacent normal tissues. Accordingly, we also demonstrated that overexpression of LINC00152 promoted the migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells. Consistently, we observed an increased abundance of gram-negative bacteria and LPS in tumors tissue. Taken together, the above data implicated that enriched gram-negative bacteria in tumor tissue might promote tumor growth through modulating the expression of LINC00152. Furthermore, we demonstrated that LPS upregulated the expression of LINC00152 by introducing histone lactylation on its promoter and decreasing the binding efficiency of the repressor, YY1, to it. Our results provide new insights into how enterobacteria affect host epigenetics in human disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfer RNA-derived fragments are a group of small noncoding single-stranded RNA that play essential roles in multiple diseases. However, their biological functions in carcinogenesis are not well understood. In this study, 5&amp;rsquo;tRF-Gly was found to have significantly high expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the upregulation of 5&amp;rsquo;tRF-Gly was positively correlated with tumor size and tumor metastasis. Overexpression of 5&amp;rsquo;tRF-Gly induced increased growth rate and metastasis in HCC cells in vitro and in nude mice, while knockdown showed the opposite effect. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) was confirmed to be a direct target of 5&amp;rsquo;tRF-Gly in HCC. In addition, the cytological effect of CEACAM1 knockdown proved to be similar to the overexpression of 5&amp;rsquo;tRF-Gly. Moreover, attenuation of CEACAM1 expression rescued the 5&amp;rsquo;tRF-Gly-mediated promoting effects on HCC cells. These data show that 5&amp;rsquo;tRF-Gly is a new tumor-promoting factor and could be a potential diagnostic biomarker or new therapeutic target for HCC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BPTF inhibition antagonizes colorectal cancer progression by transcriptionally inactivating Cdc25A</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35932692/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPTF was aberrantly highly expressed in CRC and promoted CRC progression in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPTF promoted the transcription of Cdc25A by binding to −178/+107 region of the Cdc25A promoter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPTF itself was transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc in CRC cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPTF inactivity sensitized CRC cells to chemotherapeutics, c-Myc inhibitor and cell cycle inhibitor in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C-Myc/BPTF/Cdc25A signaling axis is expected to be cascade candidate biomarkers for CRC diagnosis and prognosis prediction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the largest subunit of the nuclear remodeling factor complex, Bromodomain PHD Finger Transcription Factor (BPTF) has been reported to be involved in tumorigenesis and development in several cancers. However, to date, its functions and related molecular mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) are still poorly defined and deserve to be revealed. In this study, we uncovered that, under the expression regulation of c-Myc, BPTF promoted CRC progression by targeting Cdc25A. BPTF was found to be highly expressed in CRC and promoted the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells through BPTF specific siRNAs, shRNAs or inhibitors. Based on RNA-seq, combined with DNA-pulldown, ChIP and luciferase reporter assay, we proved that, by binding to −178/+107 region within Cdc25A promoter, BPTF transcriptionally activated Cdc25A, thus accelerating the cell cycle process of CRC cells. Meanwhile, BPTF itself was found to be transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc. Moreover, BPTF knockdown or inactivation was verified to sensitize CRC cells to chemotherapeutics, 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) and Oxaliplatin (Oxa), c-Myc inhibitor and cell cycle inhibitor not just at the cellular level in vitro, but in subcutaneous xenografts or AOM/DSS-induced in situ models of CRC in mice, while Cdc25A overexpression partially reversed BPTF silencing-caused tumor growth inhibition. Clinically, BPTF, c-Myc and Cdc25A were highly expressed in CRC tissues simultaneously, the expression of any two of the three was positively correlated, and their expressions were highly relevant to tumor differentiation, TNM staging and poor prognosis of CRC patients. Thus, our study indicated that the targeted inhibition of BPTF alone, or together with chemotherapy and/or cell cycle-targeted therapy, might act as a promising new strategy for CRC treatment, while c-Myc/BPTF/Cdc25A signaling axis is expected to be developed as an associated set of candidate biomarkers for CRC diagnosis and prognosis prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;LINC01085&lt;/em&gt; is deleted in hormone-independent prostate cancer (HIPC) which can predict better outcomes of HIPC patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01085 acts as a tumor suppressor in the tumourigenicity and metastasis of HIPC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01085 exerts its functions by both interacting with TBK1 and GSK3β, accelerated TBK1 phosphorylation at the Ser-172 site, in HIPC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01085 combined with PARP inhibitor and anti-PD-L1 treatment may be pivotal in the treatment of HIPC patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquired docetaxel (doc) resistance, one of the major reasons for unfavorable prognosis in patients with aggressive hormone-independent prostate cancer (HIPC), is a major obstacle for patient treatment. Dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs promotes or suppresses chemoresistance in multiple cancers; however, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying HIPC remain unknown. In this study, we found that the LINC01085, as a tumor-suppressor, which showed significant clinically relevant in HIPC patients with doc-resistance. Mechanistically, in docetaxel-sensitive cells, LINC01085 could specifically bind to both TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and higher LINC01085 RNA levels could inhibit TBK1 dimerization. Whereas, in doc-resistant cells, lower LINC01085 RNA level lost the strong binding with both, meanwhile, the interaction between TBK1 and GSK3β enhanced which accelerated TBK1 phosphorylation at the Ser-172 site, resulting in decreased expression levels of PD-L1 and NF-κB as well as the secretion of type I/III interferons. Thus, Overexpression of LINC01085 combined with immune checkpoint blockade is an effective strategy for the treatment of HIPC patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long non-coding RNA EVADR induced by Fusobacterium nucleatum infection promotes colorectal cancer metastasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35858553/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highli&lt;/strong&gt;ghts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; infection is enriched in CRC tissues with metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; promotes CRC cell metastasis to the liver and lung in mouse models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVADR induced by &lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; increases CRC metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVADR interacts with YBX1 to enhance the translation of EMT-related factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt;) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) EVADR are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but their relationship with CRC metastasis and the mechanisms by which EVADR promotes CRC metastasis are poorly understood. Here, we report that &lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; promotes colorectal cancer cell metastasis to the liver and lung and that it can be detected in CRC-metastasis colonization in mouse models. Furthermore, &lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; upregulates the expression of EVADR, which can increase the metastatic ability of CRC cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, elevated EVADR serves as a modular scaffold for the Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) to directly enhance the translation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors, such as Snail, Slug, and Zeb1. These findings suggest that EVADR induced by &lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; promotes colorectal cancer metastasis through YBX1-dependent translation. The EVADR-YBX1 axis may be useful for the prevention and treatment of patients with &lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt;-associated CRC metastas&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging roles of extracellular vesicle-associated non-coding RNAs in hypoxia: Insights from cancer, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35966580/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia is a central pathophysiological component in cancer, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, which represent the most common medical conditions resulting in long-term disability and death. Recent evidence suggests common signaling pathways in these diverse settings mediated by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are packaged in extracellular vesicles (EVs) protecting ncRNAs from degradation. EVs are a heterogeneous group of lipid bilayer-covered vesicles released from virtually all cells, which have important roles in intercellular communication. Recent studies pointed out that ncRNAs including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are selectively sorted into EVs, modulating specific aspects of cancer development, namely cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, immune tolerance or drug resistance, under conditions of hypoxia in recipient cells. In myocardial infarction and stroke, ncRNAs shuttled via EVs have been shown to control tissue survival and remodeling post-hypoxia by regulating cell injury, inflammatory responses, angiogenesis, neurogenesis or neuronal plasticity. This review discusses recent evidence on EV-associated ncRNAs in hypoxic cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke, discussing their cellular origin, biological function and disease significance. The emerging concept of lncRNA-circular RNA/ miRNA/ mRNA networks is outlined, upon which ncRNAs synergistically respond to hypoxia in order to modify disease responses. Particular notion is given to ncRNAs participating in at least two of the three conditions, which revealed a large degree of overlaps across pathophysiological conditions. Possible roles of EV-ncRNAs as therapeutic products or theranostic markers are defined.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SHF Acts as a Novel Tumor Suppressor in Glioblastoma Multiforme by Disrupting STAT3 Dimerization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35843865/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustained activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a critical contributor in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance, thus making it an attractive cancer therapeutic target. Here, SH2 domain-containing adapter protein F (SHF) is identified as a tumor suppressor in glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) and its negative regulation of STAT3 activity is characterized. Mechanically, SHF selectively binds and inhibits acetylated STAT3 dimerization without affecting STAT3 phosphorylation or acetylation. Additionally, by blocking STAT3-DNMT1 (DNA Methyltransferase 1) interaction, SHF relieves methylation of tumor suppressor genes. The SH2 domain is documented to be essential for SHF&amp;rsquo;s actions on STAT3, and almost entirely replaces the functions of SHF on STAT3 independently. Moreover, the peptide C16 a peptide derived from the STAT3-binding sites of SHF inhibits STAT3 dimerization and STAT3/DNMT1 interaction, and achieves remarkable growth inhibition in GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. These findings strongly identify targeting of the SHF/STAT3 interaction as a promising strategy for developing an optimal STAT3 inhibitor and provide early evidence of the potential clinical efficacy of STAT3 inhibitors such as C16 in GBM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KRAS mutant-driven SUMOylation controls extracellular vesicle transmission to trigger lymphangiogenesis in pancreatic cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35579947/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lymph node (LN) metastasis occurs frequently in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and predicts poor prognosis for patients. The KRASG12D mutation confers an aggressive PDAC phenotype that is susceptible to lymphatic dissemination. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying KRASG12D mutation-driven LN metastasis in PDAC remains unclear. Herein, we found that PDAC with the KRASG12D mutation (KRASG12D PDAC) sustained extracellular vesicle-mediated (EV-mediated) transmission of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) in a SUMOylation-dependent manner and promoted lymphangiogenesis and LN metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, hnRNPA1 bound with SUMO2 at the lysine 113 residue via KRASG12D-induced hyperactivation of SUMOylation, which enabled its interaction with TSG101 to enhance hnRNPA1 packaging and transmission via EVs. Subsequently, SUMOylation induced EV-packaged-hnRNPA1 anchoring to the adenylate- and uridylate-rich elements of PROX1 in lymphatic endothelial cells, thus stabilizing PROX1 mRNA. Importantly, impeding SUMOylation of EV-packaged hnRNPA1 dramatically inhibited LN metastasis of KRASG12D PDAC in a genetically engineered KrasG12D/+ Trp53R172H/+ Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mouse model. Our findings highlight the mechanism by which KRAS mutant-driven SUMOylation triggers EV-packaged hnRNPA1 transmission to promote lymphangiogenesis and LN metastasis, shedding light on the potential application of hnRNPA1 as a therapeutic target in patients with KRASG12D PDAC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tankyrase-selective inhibitor STP1002 shows preclinical antitumour efficacy without on-target toxicity in the gastrointestinal tract</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35849876/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35849876/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Tankyrase inhibition stabilises AXINs and antagonises the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-mutated colorectal cancer (CRC), suggesting that tankyrase is a potential therapeutic target for APC-mutated CRC. However, clinical trials on reported tankyrase inhibitors have been severely limited by on-target toxicity in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Herein, we report a new tankyrase-selective inhibitor, STP1002, having preclinical antitumour efficacy without on-target toxicity in APC-mutated CRC models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; STP1002 was developed and characterised using in vitro and in vivo functional studies; its pharmacokinetics, antitumour efficacy and toxicity were evaluated in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; STP1002 showed potent, selective inhibition of tankyrase 1/2 but not of members of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2 (PARP1/2). STP1002 exerted antitumour activity by stabilising AXINs and antagonising the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in a subset of APC-mutated CRC cell lines but not in inhibitor-resistant cells and APC-wild-type CRC cell lines. STP1002 showed favourable pharmacokinetic profiles for oral administration once daily. STP1002 inhibited tumour growth of APC-mutated CRC xenograft animal models but not of APC-wild type models in a dose-dependent manner. The antitumour efficacy of STP1002 was confirmed using APC-mutated CRC patient-derived tumour xenograft models. STP1002 showed no significant on-target toxicity in the GI tract compared to G007-LK, which shows severe ileum toxicity in preclinical animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These results demonstrate that STP1002, a novel, orally active tankyrase inhibitor, shows preclinical antitumour efficacy without on-target toxicity in the GI tract. Our data provide a rationale for a clinical trial on STP1002 as a potential tankyrase-targeted drug in patients with APC-mutated CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Circulating Tumor DNA in Colorectal Cancer: Current and Evolving Practices</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35839443/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exists a tremendous opportunity in identifying and determining the appropriate predictive and prognostic biomarker(s) for risk stratification of patients with colorectal cancers (CRCs). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising prognostic and possibly predictive biomarker in the personalized management of patients with CRCs. The disease is particularly suited to a liquid biopsy-based approach since there is a great deal of shedding of circulating tumor fragments (cells, DNA, methylation markers, etc). ctDNA has been shown to have several potential applications, including detecting minimal residual disease (MRD), monitoring for early recurrence, molecular profiling, and therapeutic response prediction. The utility of ctDNA has broadened from its initial use in the advanced/metastatic setting for molecular profiling and detection of acquired resistance mechanisms, toward identifying MRD, as well as early detection. Prospective studies such as CIRCULATE, COBRA, Dynamic II/III, and ACT3 are underway in the MRD setting to further understand how ctDNA may be used to inform clinical decision making using both tumor-informed and tumor-agnostic platforms. These prospective studies use ctDNA to guide management of patients with CRC and will be critical to help guide how and where ctDNA should or should not be used in clinical decision making. It is also important to understand that there are different types of ctDNA liquid biopsy platforms, each with advantages and disadvantages in different clinical indications. This review provides an overview of the current and evolving use of ctDNA in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TCR-Vγδ usage distinguishes protumor from antitumor intestinal γδ T cell subsets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;γδ T cells represent a substantial fraction of intestinal lymphocytes at homeostasis, but they also constitute a major lymphocyte population infiltrating colorectal cancers (CRCs); however, their temporal contribution to CRC development or progression remains unclear. Using human CRC samples and murine CRC models, we found that most γδ T cells in premalignant or nontumor colons exhibit cytotoxic markers, whereas tumor-infiltrating γδ T cells express a protumorigenic profile. These contrasting T cell profiles were associated with distinct T cell receptor (TCR)-Vγδ gene usage in both humans and mice. Longitudinal intersectional genetics and antibody-dependent strategies targeting murine γδ T cells enriched in the epithelium at steady state led to heightened tumor development, whereas targeting γδ subsets that accumulate during CRC resulted in reduced tumor growth. Our results uncover temporal pro- and antitumor roles for γδ T cell subsets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting sphingosine kinase 1/2 by a novel dual inhibitor SKI-349 suppresses non-small cell lung cancer cell growth</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35831279/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and sphingosine kinase (SphK2) are both important therapeutic targets of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SKI-349 is a novel, highly efficient and small molecular SphK1/2 dual inhibitor. Here in primary human NSCLC cells and immortalized cell lines, SKI-349 potently inhibited cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration and viability. The dual inhibitor induced mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis activation in NSCLC cells, but it was non-cytotoxic to human lung epithelial cells. SKI-349 inhibited SphK activity and induced ceramide accumulation in primary NSCLC cells, without affecting SphK1/2 expression. SKI-349-induced NSCLC cell death was attenuated by sphingosine-1-phosphate and by the SphK activator K6PC-5, but was potentiated by the short-chain ceramide C6. Moreover, SKI-349 induced Akt-mTOR inactivation, JNK activation, and oxidative injury in primary NSCLC cells. In addition, SKI-349 decreased bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) expression and downregulated BRD4-dependent genes (Myc, cyclin D1 and Klf4) in primary NSCLC cells. At last, SKI-349 (10 mg/kg) administration inhibited NSCLC xenograft growth in nude mice. Akt-mTOR inhibition, JNK activation, oxidative injury and BRD4 downregulation were detected in SKI-349-treated NSCLC xenograft tissues. Taken together, targeting SphK1/2 by SKI-349 potently inhibits NSCLC cell growth &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the male urinary system. In recent years, the morbidity and mortality of PCa have been increasing due to the limited effects of existing treatment strategies. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00893 was reported to inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of papillary thyroid cancer cells, but its role in PCa has not been reported. This study aims to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of LINC00893 in regulating the progression of PCa cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We first compared LINC00893 expression levels between PCa tissues and normal prostate tissues through TCGA database. The relative LINC00893 expression levels were further validated in 66 pairs of PCa tissues and para-cancerous normal tissues, as well as in PCa cell lines. Gain-of-function experiment was performed by transfecting PCa cell with LINC00893 expression vector, and CCK (Cell count kit)-8, 5-Ethynyl-2&amp;rsquo;-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, colony information and transwell assays were conducted to assess the functional phenotypes. Dual-luciferase reporter, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pull-down assays were performed to evaluate the molecular interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; LINC00893 was downregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines, and patients with low expression of LINC00893 were associated with a poorer overall survival rate. LINC00893 overexpression hindered the proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as the migratory ability of PCa cells, and suppressed the tumorigenesis of PCa cells in nude mice. We further demonstrated that LINC00893 acted as a sponge for miR-3173-5p and inhibited its activity, which in turn regulated the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)/Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study demonstrated that LINC00893 suppresses the progression of PCa cells through targeting miR-3173-5p/SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 axis. Our data uncovers a novel tumor-suppressor role of LINC00893 in PCa, which may serve as a potential strategy for targeted therapy in PCa.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dopamine Signaling Promotes Tissue-Resident Memory Differentiation of CD8&#43; T Cells and Antitumor Immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35802647/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue-resident memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T (T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;) cells have been associated with robust protective antitumor immune responses and improved prognosis of patients with cancer. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that modulate either the production or activity of T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells could be effective for treating cancer. Using a high-throughput drug screen, we showed that the neurotransmitter dopamine drives differentiation of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells into CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells. In murine syngeneic tumor xenograft models and clinical human colon cancer samples, DRD5 served as the major functional dopamine receptor on CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and positively correlated with T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cell density. DRD5 deficiency led to a failure of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells to accumulate in tissues, resulting in impaired T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cell formation, reduced effector function, and uncontrolled disease progression. Moreover, dopamine treatment promoted the antitumor activity of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and suppressed colorectal cancer growth in immunocompentent mouse models, and ex vivo preconditioning with dopamine enhanced the in vivo efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. Finally, in a patient with colorectal cancer cohort, dopamine expression was positively associated with patient survival and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell infiltration. These findings suggest that dopaminergic immunoregulation plays an important role in the differentiation of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells into CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells and thereby modulates T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;-elicited antitumor immunity in colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of an immunostimulatory function of dopamine signaling by promoting tissue-resident memory T-cell differentiation and sustaining T-cell effector functions reveals potential therapeutic strategies and prognostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanoma cells display distinct intrinsic phenotypic states. Here, we seek to characterize the molecular regulation of these states using multi-omic analyses of whole exome, transcriptome, microRNA, long non-coding RNA and DNA methylation data together with reverse-phase protein array data on a panel of 68 highly annotated early passage melanoma cell lines. We demonstrate that clearly defined cancer cell intrinsic transcriptomic programs are maintained in melanoma cells ex vivo and remain highly conserved within melanoma tumors, are associated with distinct immune features within tumors, and differentially correlate with checkpoint inhibitor and adoptive T cell therapy efficacy. Through integrative analyses we demonstrate highly complex multi-omic regulation of melanoma cell intrinsic programs that provide key insights into the molecular maintenance of phenotypic states. These findings have implications for cancer biology and the identification of new therapeutic strategies. Further, these deeply characterized cell lines will serve as an invaluable resource for future research in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HuR as a molecular target for cancer therapeutics and immune-related disorders</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35817212/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control of eukaryotic gene expression occurs at multiple levels, from transcription to messenger RNA processing, transport, localization, turnover, and translation. RNA-binding proteins control gene expression and are involved in different stages of mRNA processing, including splicing, maturation, turnover, and translation. A ubiquitously expressed RBP Human antigen R is engaged in the RNA processes mentioned above but, most importantly, controls mRNA stability and turnover. Dysregulation of HuR is linked to many diseases, including cancer and other immune-related disorders. HuR targets mRNAs containing AU-rich elements at their 3&amp;rsquo;untranslated region, which encodes proteins involved in cell growth, proliferation, tumor formation, angiogenesis, immune evasion, inflammation, invasion, and metastasis. HuR overexpression has been reported in many tumor types, which led to a poor prognosis for patients. Hence, HuR is considered an appealing drug target for cancer treatment. Therefore, multiple attempts have been made to identify small molecule inhibitors for blocking HuR functions. This article reviews the current prospects of drugs that target HuR in numerous cancer types, their mode of action, and off-target effects. Furthermore, we will summarize drugs that interfered with HuR-RNA interactions and established themselves as novel therapeutics. We will also highlight the significance of HuR overexpression in multiple cancers and discuss its role in immune functions. This review provides evidence of a new era of HuR-targeted small molecules that can be used for cancer therapeutics either as a monotherapy or in combination with other cancer treatment modalities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification and characterization of novel CD274 (PD-L1) regulating microRNAs and their functional relevance in melanoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35802807/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Immune checkpoint inhibitors directed against programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1/PD1) receptor and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (CD274/PD-L1) have been recently successfully implemented for the treatment of many cancers, but the response rate of tumour patients is still limited due to intrinsic and acquired resistances. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this limited response have still to be defined in detail. The aim of this study is to uncover processes inhibiting PDCD1/CD274 expression thereby enhancing anti-tumour immune responses. The identification and characterization of microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting the 3&amp;rsquo;-untranslated region (3&amp;rsquo;-UTR) as well as the coding sequence (CDS) of CD274 will provide the basis for a new drug development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Human melanoma cell lines and tissue samples were subjected to mRNA and/or protein expression analysis using qPCR, Western blot, flow cytometry, and/or immunohistochemistry. The data were correlated to clinical parameters. MiRNA trapping by RNA in vitro affinity purification (miTRAP) technology in combination with small RNA sequencing and different bioinformatics tools were employed to identify CD274-regulating miRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Screening based on miTRAP in combination with RNAseq identified a large number of novel CD274-regulating candidate miRNAs, from which eight selected miRNAs were functionally validated. Five out of eight miRNAs were able to significantly reduce CD274 surface expression indicating that these miRNAs directly bind to the 3&amp;rsquo;-UTR or CDS of the CD274 gene. The miRNA-mediated inhibition of CD274 expression was accompanied by an increased T cell recognition. Furthermore, an inverse expression of three CD274-regulating miRNAs and CD274 was demonstrated in melanoma lesions. A CD274 miRNA score was generated, which was associated with disease progression and reduced survival of melanoma patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These data revealed a novel mechanism that miRNAs targeting the CDS of immune checkpoint genes are functional, have prognostic relevance, and also the potential for the development of novel miRNA-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HOTAIR/miR-1277-5p/ZEB1 axis mediates hypoxia-induced oxaliplatin resistance via regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35798695/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypoxic microenvironment contributes to the chemoresistance of many malignant tumors including colorectal cancer (CRC). Accumulating studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in chemotherapy resistance. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of lncRNAs in hypoxia-mediated resistance in CRC and its potential mechanism. Here, we discovered that hypoxia-induced oxaliplatin resistance and HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) expression was increased in hypoxia-treated CRC cell lines and CRC tumors. Knockdown of HOTAIR by siRNA reduced the viability and proliferation of CRC cells treated with oxaliplatin and reversed hypoxia-induced resistance. Mechanically, we found that HOTAIR modulates zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) expression by negative regulations of miR-1277-5p. When miR-1277-5p was silenced, knockdown of HOTAIR was unable to reduce the oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells. In mouse models of CRC, HOTAIR knockdown markedly inhibited the tumor growth when treated with oxaliplatin. Thus, HOTAIR/miR-1277-5p/ZEB1 axis appears a promising therapeutic target for improving the oxaliplatin efficacy in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel lncRNA RP11-386G11.10 reprograms lipid metabolism to promote hepatocellular carcinoma progression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35798238/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LncRNA &lt;em&gt;RP11-386G11.10&lt;/em&gt; was up-regulated in HCC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overexpression of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;RP11-386G11.10&lt;/em&gt; promoted the proliferation, metastasis of HCC cells in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We confirmed that regulation of HNRNPU expression by RP11-286H15.1 resulted in lipid accumulation in HCC cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HNRNPU forms a ZBTB7A-&lt;em&gt;RP11-386G11.10&lt;/em&gt;-HNRNPU positive feedback loop by promoting mRNA stability of ZBTB7A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Emerging studies suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A rapidly increasing number of studies have shown that metabolic changes including lipid metabolic reprogramming play a significant role in the progression of HCC. But it remains to be elucidated how lncRNAs affect tumor cell metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Through analysis and screening of The Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) dataset, we found a novel lncRNA RP11-386G11.10 was overexpressed, related to prognosis, conserved and non-protein-coding in HCC and related to poor prognosis. Then, CCK-8, colony formation, Transwell invasion, wound healing assays were performed and nude mouse subcutaneous tumour formation and lung metastasis models were established to explore the effect of RP11-386G11.10 on HCC tumour growth and metastasis. Chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Nile red staining detected the effect of RP11-386G11.10 on lipid metabolism in HCC. Mechanistically, we clarified the RP11-386G11.10/miR-345-3p/HNRNPU signalling pathway through dual luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and identified ZBTB7A as a transcription factor of RP11-386G11.10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; RP11-386G11.10 was overexpressed in HCC and positively correlated with tumour size, TNM stage, and poor prognosis in HCC patients. RP11-386G11.10 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, RP11-386G11.10 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-345-3p to regulate the expression of HNRNPU and its downstream lipogenic enzymes, leading to lipid accumulation in HCC cells and promoting their growth and metastasis. In addition, we identified ZBTB7A as a transcription factor of RP11-386G11.10. Moreover, HNRNPU promoted the expression of ZBTB7A in HCC cells, thereby increasing the transcriptional activity of RP11-386G11.10, and forming a positive feedback loop, ultimately leading continuous lipid accumulation, growth and metastasis in HCC cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results indicated that the lncRNA RP11-386G11.10 was a novel oncogenic lncRNA that was strongly correlated with the poor prognosis of HCC. The ZBTB7A-RP11-386G11.10-HNRNPU positive feedback loop promoted the progression of HCC by regulating lipid anabolism. RP11-386G11.10 may become a new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and therapy target for HCC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Glycoengineered anti-CD39 promotes anticancer responses by depleting suppressive cells and inhibiting angiogenesis in tumor models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35775486/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunosuppressive cells accumulating in the tumor microenvironment constitute a formidable barrier that interferes with current immunotherapeutic approaches. A unifying feature of these tumor-associated immune and vascular endothelial cells appears to be the elevated expression of ectonucleotidase CD39, which in tandem with ecto-5&amp;rsquo;-nucleotidase CD73, catalyzes the conversion of extracellular ATP into adenosine. We glycoengineered an afucosylated anti-CD39 IgG2c and tested this reagent in mouse melanoma and colorectal tumor models. We identified major biological effects of this approach on cancer growth, associated with depletion of immunosuppressive cells, mediated through enhanced Fcγ receptor-directed (FcγR-directed), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Furthermore, regulatory/exhausted T cells lost CD39 expression, as a consequence of antibody-mediated trogocytosis. Most strikingly, tumor-associated macrophages and endothelial cells with high CD39 expression were effectively depleted following antibody treatment, thereby blocking angiogenesis. Tumor site-specific cellular modulation and lack of angiogenesis synergized with chemotherapy and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in experimental tumor models. We conclude that depleting suppressive cells and targeting tumor vasculature, through administration of afucosylated anti-CD39 antibody and the activation of ADCC, comprises an improved, purinergic system-modulating strategy for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NY-ESO-1-specific redirected T cells with endogenous TCR knockdown mediate tumor response and cytokine release syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35768164/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Because of the shortage of ideal cell surface antigens, the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells (TCR-T) that target intracellular antigens such as NY-ESO-1 is a promising approach for treating patients with solid tumors. However, endogenous TCRs in vector-transduced T cells have been suggested to impair cell-surface expression of transduced TCR while generating mispaired TCRs that can become self-reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We conducted a first-in-human phase I clinical trial with the TCR-transduced T-cell product (TBI-1301) in patients with NY-ESO-1-expressing solid tumors. In manufacturing TCR-T cells, we used a novel affinity-enhanced NY-ESO-1-specific TCR that was transduced by a retroviral vector that enables siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated silencing of endogenous TCR. The patients were divided into two cohorts. Cohort 1 was given a dose of 5×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cells (whole cells including TCR-T cells) preconditioned with 1500 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cyclophosphamide. Cohort 2 was given 5× 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cells preconditioned with 1500 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cyclophosphamide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In vitro study showed that both the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T fractions of TCR-T cells exhibited cytotoxic effects against NY-ESO-1-expressing tumor cells. Three patients and six patients were allocated to cohort 1 and cohort 2, respectively. Three of the six patients who received 5×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cells showed tumor response, while three patients developed early-onset cytokine release syndrome (CRS). One of the patients developed a grade 3 lung injury associated with the infiltration of the TCR-T cells. No siRNA-related adverse events other than CRS were observed. Cytokines including interleukin 6 I and monocyte chemotactic protein-1/chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL2)increased in the sera of patients with CRS. In vitro analysis showed these cytokines were not secreted from the T cells infused. A significant fraction of the manufactured T cells in patients with CRS was found to express either CD244, CD39, or both at high levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The trial showed that endogenous TCR-silenced and affinity-enhanced NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cells were safely administered except for grade 3 lung injury. The TCR-T cell infusion exhibited significant tumor response and early-onset CRS in patients with tumors that express NY-ESO-1 at high levels. The differentiation properties of the manufactured T cells may be prognostic for TCR-T-related CRS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging role of exosomes in cancer progression and tumor microenvironment remodeling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35765040/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and the factors responsible for its progression need to be elucidated. Exosomes are structures with an average size of 100 nm that can transport proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. This review focuses on the role of exosomes in cancer progression and therapy. We discuss how exosomes are able to modulate components of the tumor microenvironment and influence proliferation and migration rates of cancer cells. We also highlight that, depending on their cargo, exosomes can suppress or promote tumor cell progression and can enhance or reduce cancer cell response to radio- and chemo-therapies. In addition, we describe how exosomes can trigger chronic inflammation and lead to immune evasion and tumor progression by focusing on their ability to transfer non-coding RNAs between cells and modulate other molecular signaling pathways such as PTEN and PI3K/Akt in cancer. Subsequently, we discuss the use of exosomes as carriers of anti-tumor agents and genetic tools to control cancer progression. We then discuss the role of tumor-derived exosomes in carcinogenesis. Finally, we devote a section to the study of exosomes as diagnostic and prognostic tools in clinical courses that is important for the treatment of cancer patients. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of exosomes in cancer therapy, focusing on their therapeutic value in cancer progression and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prediction of the Mechanism of Sodium Butyrate against Radiation-Induced Lung Injury in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Dynamic Simulations and Molecular Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35837112/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a severe side effect of radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ,and one of the major hindrances to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. Previous studies have confirmed that sodium butyrate (NaB) has potential of anti-radiation toxicity. However, the mechanism of the protective effect of NaB against RILI has not yet been clarified. This study aimed to explore the underlying protective mechanisms of NaB against RILI in NSCLC through network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The predictive target genes of NaB were obtained from the PharmMapper database and the literature review. The involved genes of RILI and NSCLC were predicted using OMIM and GeneCards database. The intersectional genes of drug and disease were identified using the Venny tool and uploaded to the Cytoscape software to identify 5 core target genes of NaB associated with RILI. The correlations between the 5 core target genes and EGFR, PD-L1, immune infiltrates, chemokines and chemokine receptors were analyzed using TIMER 2.0, TIMER and TISIDB databases. We constructed the mechanism maps of the 3 key signaling pathways using the KEGG database based on the results of GO and KEGG analyses from Metascape database. The 5 core target genes and drug were docked using the AutoDock Vina tool and visualized using PyMOL software. GROMACS software was used to perform 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation. Irradiation-induced lung injury model in mice were established to assess the therapeutic effects of NaB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 51 intersectional genes involved in NaB against RILI in NSCLC were identified. The 5 core target genes were AKT1, TP53, NOTCH1, SIRT1, and PTEN. The expressions of the 5 core target genes were significantly associated with EGFR, PD-L1, immune infiltrates, chemokines and chemokine receptors, respectively. The results from GO analysis of the 51 intersectional genes revealed that the biological processes were focused on the regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, oxidative stress and cell death, while the three key KEGG pathways were enriched in PI3K-Akt signal pathway, p53 signal pathway, and FOXO signal pathway. The docking of NaB with the 5 core target genes showed affinity and stability, especially AKT1. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments showed that NaB treatment significantly protected mice from RILI, with reduced lung histological damage. In addition, NaB treatment significantly inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; NaB may protect patients from RILI in NSCLC through multiple target genes including AKT1, TP53, NOTCH1, SIRT1 and PTEN, with multiple signaling pathways involving, including PI3K-Akt pathway, p53 pathway, and FOXO pathways. Our findings effectively provide a feasible theoretical basis to further elucidate the mechanism of NaB in the treatment of RILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immune- and Stemness-Related Genes Revealed by Comprehensive Analysis and Validation for Cancer Immunity and Prognosis and Its Nomogram in Lung Adenocarcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35833114/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a familiar lung cancer with a very poor prognosis. This study investigated the immune- and stemness-related genes to develop model related with cancer immunity and prognosis in LUAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Method:&lt;/em&gt; The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was utilized for obtaining original transcriptome data and clinical information. Differential expression, prognostic value, and correlation with clinic parameter of mRNA stemness index (mRNAsi) were conducted in LUAD. Significant mRNAsi-related module and hub genes were screened using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). Meanwhile, immune-related differential genes (IRGs) were screened in LUAD. Stem cell index and immune-related differential genes (SC-IRGs) were screened and further developed to construct prognosis-related model and nomogram. Comprehensive analysis of hub genes and subgroups, involving enrichment in the subgroup [gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)], gene mutation, genetic correlation, gene expression, immune, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and drug sensitivity, used bioinformatics and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Through difference analysis, mRNAsi of LUAD group was markedly higher than that of normal group. Clinical parameters (age, gender, and T staging) were ascertained to be highly relevant to mRNAsi. MEturquoise and MEblue were found to be the most significant modules (including positive and negative correlations) related to mRNAsi via WGCNA. The functions and pathways of the two mRNAsi-related modules were mainly enriched in tumorigenesis, development, and metastasis. Combining stem cell index-related differential genes and immune-related differential genes, 30 prognosis-related SC-IRGs were screened via Cox regression analysis. Then, 16 prognosis-related SC-IRGs were screened to construct a LASSO regression model at last. In addition, the model was successfully validated by using TCGA-LUAD and GSE68465, whereas c-index and the calibration curves were utilized to demonstrate the clinical value of our nomogram. Following the validation of the model, GSEA, immune cell correlation, TMB, clinical relevance, etc., have found significant difference in high- and low-risk groups, and 16-gene expression of the SC-IRG model also was tested by RT-PCR. &lt;em&gt;ADRB2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ANGPTL4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CBLC&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CX3CR1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;IL3RA&lt;/em&gt; were found markedly different expression between the tumor and normal group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The SC-IRG model and the prognostic nomogram could accurately predict LUAD survival. Our study used mRNAsi combined with immunity that may lay a foundation for the future research studies in LUAD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting the &#34;undruggable&#34;: RNA-binding proteins in the spotlight in cancer therapy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumors refractory to conventional therapy belong to specific subpopulations of cancer cells, which have acquired a higher number of mutations/epigenetic changes than the majority of cancer cells. This property provides them the ability to become resistant to therapy. Aberrant expression of certain RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can regulate the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs by binding to specific regions present in the 3´-UTR of certain mRNAs to promote or repress mRNA translation or by interacting with other proteins (including RBPs) and non-coding RNAs that are part of ribonucleoprotein complexes. In particular, an increasing interest in the RBPs involved in chemoresistance has recently emerged. In this review, we discuss how RBPs are not only affected by chemotherapeutic treatments, but also play an active role in therapeutic responses via the direct modulation of crucial cancer-related proteins. A special focus is being placed on the development of therapeutic strategies targeting these RBPs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Terbinafine prevents colorectal cancer growth by inducing dNTP starvation and reducing immune suppression</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing evidence indicates that gut fungal dysbiosis might play a key role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We sought to explore whether reversing the fungal dysbiosis by terbinafine, an approved antifungal drug, might inhibit the development of CRC. A population-based study from Sweden identified a total of 185 patients who received terbinafine after their CRC diagnosis and found that they had a decreased risk of death (hazard ratio = 0.50) and metastasis (hazard ratio = 0.44) compared with patients without terbinafine administration. In multiple mouse models of CRC, administration of terbinafine decreased the fungal load, the fungus-induced myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) expansion, and the tumor burden. Fecal microbiota transplantation from mice without terbinafine treatment reversed MDSC infiltration and partially restored tumor proliferation. Mechanistically, terbinafine directly impaired tumor cell proliferation by reducing the ratio of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) to reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), suppressing the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), resulting in nucleotide synthesis disruption, deoxyribonucleotide (dNTP) starvation, and cell-cycle arrest. Collectively, terbinafine can inhibit CRC by reversing fungal dysbiosis, suppressing tumor cell proliferation, inhibiting fungus-induced MDSC infiltration, and restoring antitumor immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Based on lapatinib innovative near-infrared fluorescent probes targeting HER1/HER2 for in vivo tumors imaging</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35779413/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human epidermal growth factor receptors HER1 and HER2, overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, are key regulators of tumor cells proliferation, invasion and survival. Many antibody- or peptide-based fluorescent probes targeted to HER1/HER2 are under active clinical evaluation. However, the effective small-molecule near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes are still lacking. Herein, with the strategy of drug repurposing, we developed a series of HER1/HER2-targeted probes YQ-H (01-07) composed of fluorophore (a cyanine dye, MPA), linker unit and targeted unit (lapatinib, LAP). The synthesized probes were evaluated in vitro and in vivo tumor specificity/affinity. Specially, the probe YQ-H-06 exhibited optimal pharmacokinetic property and tumor/normal tissue ratio (T/N) in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, we evaluated the targeting capability of YQ-H-06 in orthotopic colorectal cancer and orthotopic hepatic carcinoma mice. It was indicated that YQ-H-06 had the characteristic of great biosafety, favorable pH and chemical stability, as well as provided excellent tumor contrast in orthotopic murine tumor models. The NIR fluorescent probe YQ-H-06 will shed light on tumor detection and fluorescence-guided surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Garcinone C Suppresses Tumorsphere Formation and Invasiveness by Hedgehog/Gli1 Signaling in Colorectal Cancer Stem-like Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35749593/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperactivation of hedgehog signaling occurs in colorectal cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), a rare subpopulation, potentially involved in metastasis, chemotherapy resistance, and cancer relapse. Garcinone C, a xanthone isolated from mangosteen (&lt;em&gt;Garcinia mangostana&lt;/em&gt;), suppresses colorectal cancer &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; by inhibiting Gli1-dependent noncanonical hedgehog signaling. Herein, we investigated the effect of garcinone C on cancer stemness and invasiveness in colorectal cancer; Gli1 was noted as pivotal in maintaining stemness and invasiveness in HCT116 and HT29 CSCs. Garcinone C inhibited the proliferation and self-renewal of HCT116 and HT29 CSCs. Colon cancer stemness markers such as CD44, CD133, ALDH1, and Nanog were significantly decreased by garcinone C. Computational studies showed that garcinone C showed a high affinity with the Gli1 protein ZF domain by forming hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues of ASP244, ARG223, and ASP216. Besides, MG132 blocked the effects of garcinone C on Gli1. Thus, garcinone C suppressed colorectal CSCs by binding to Gli1 and enhancing its degradation. MMP2 and MMP9 levels, invasive-related markers, were increased in HCT116 CSCs but decreased by garcinone C. E-cadherin level was reduced in HCT116 CSCs, while the presence of garcinone C was restored. Garcinone C inhibited the proliferation and invasiveness of colorectal CSCs by targeting Gli1-dependent Hh signaling. Garcinone C may be a potent natural agent against colorectal cancer relapse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor-Activatable Nanoparticles Target Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor to Enhance Drug Delivery and Antitumor Efficacy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binding of plasma proteins to nanomedicines is widely considered detrimental to their delivery to tumors. Here, the design of OxPt/SN38 nanoparticle containing a hydrophilic oxaliplatin (OxPt) prodrug in a coordination polymer core and a hydrophobic cholesterol-conjugated SN38 prodrug on the lipid shell for active tumor targeting is reported. OxPt/SN38 hitchhikes on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, concentrates in tumors via LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis, and selectively releases SN38 and OxPt in acidic, esterase-rich, and reducing tumor microenvironments, leading to 6.0- and 4.9-times higher accumulations in tumors over free drugs. By simultaneously crosslinking DNA and inhibiting topoisomerase I, OxPt/SN38 achieved 92-98% tumor growth inhibition in five colorectal cancer tumor models and prolonged mouse survival by 58-80 days compared to free drug controls in three human colorectal cancer tumor models without causing serious side effects. The study has uncovered a novel nanomedicine strategy to co-deliver combination chemotherapies to tumors via active targeting of the LDL receptor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>circEXOC6B interacting with RRAGB, an mTORC1 activator, inhibits the progression of colorectal cancer by antagonizing the HIF1A-RRAGB-mTORC1 positive feedback loop</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35739524/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In recent years, an increasing number of studies have indicated that circular RNA plays crucial roles in regulating tumor development and chemoresistance. Using two high-throughput RNA sequence datasets, we previously found that circEXOC6B was downregulated in colon cancer. However, its role and mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) remained unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Real-time quantitative PCR was used to examine the expression of circEXOC6B in CRC tissues. In vivo and in vitro functional experiments were performed to determine the suppressor role of circEXOC6B in CRC progression. RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence were applied to investigate the possible mechanisms connecting circEXOC6B to CRC growth and 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase assay, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were used to explore the mechanisms underlying the HIF1A regulation of RRAGB transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; circEXOC6B was downregulated in CRC tissues, and its lower expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients. Functional experiments showed that circEXOC6B inhibited growth and increased the 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circEXOC6B inhibited the heterodimer formation of RRAGB by binding to it, thereby suppressing the mTORC1 pathway and HIF1A level. In addition, HIF1A upregulated the transcription of RRAGB by binding to its promoter region. Altogether, the results demonstrated that a HIF1A-RRAGB-mTORC1 positive feedback loop drives tumor progression in CRC, which could be interrupted by circEXOC6B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; circEXOC6B inhibits the progression of CRC and enhances the chemosensitivity of CRC cells to 5-fluorouracil by antagonizing the HIF1A-RRAGB-mTORC1 positive feedback loop. circEXOC6B is a possible therapeutic target for CRC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lipid metabolism-related lncRNA SLC25A21-AS1 promotes the progression of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating the NPM1/c-Myc axis and SLC25A21 expression</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Obesity alters metabolic microenvironment and is thus associated with several tumours. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role, molecular mechanism of action, and potential clinical value of lipid metabolism-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SLC25A21-AS1 in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A high-fat diets (HFDs)-induced obesity nude mouse model was established, and targeted metabolomics analysis was used to identify critical medium-long chain fatty acids influencing the growth of ESCC cells. Transcriptomic analysis of public dataset GSE53625 confirmed that lncRNA SLC25A21-AS1 was a lipid metabolism-related lncRNA. The biological function of lncRNA SLC25A21-AS1 in ESCC was investigated both in vivo and in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation(ChIP)assay, RNA-pull down, mass spectrometry, co-IP, and RNA IP(RIP) were performed to explore the molecular mechanism. Finally, an ESCC cDNA microarray was used to determine the clinical prognostic value of SLC25A21-AS1 by RT-qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Palmitic acid (PA) is an important fatty acid component of HFD and had an inhibitory effect on ESCC cell lines. LncRNA SLC25A21-AS1 expression was downregulated by PA and associated with the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SLC25A21-AS1 interacted with nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1) protein to promote the downstream gene transcription of the c-Myc in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, SLC25A21-AS1 maintained the stability of SLC25A21 mRNA and reduced the intracellular NAD+ /NADH ratio by influencing tryptophan catabolism. Finally, we demonstrated that high expression of SLC25A21-AS1 promoted resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and was correlated with poor tumour grade and overall survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; HFD/PA has an inhibitory effect on ESCC cells and SLC25A21-AS1 expression. SLC25A21-AS1 promotes the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells by regulating the NPM1/c-Myc axis and SLC25A21 expression. In addition, lncRNA SLC25A21-AS1 may serve as a favourable prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for ESCC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LINC01194 recruits NUMA1 to promote ubiquitination of RYR2 to enhance malignant progression in triple-negative breast cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01194 was highly expressed in TNBC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01194 recruited NUMA1 to stabilize UBE2C mRNA, thereby promoting RYR2 ubiquitination and degradation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01194/NUMA1/UBE2C/RYR2/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway might provide an effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 1194 (LINC01194) has been reported as an oncogene in several cancer types, but its expression and potential role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are still unclear. We found that LINC01194 was significantly highly expressed in TNBC based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Data from in vitro experiments and in vivo assays demonstrated that LINC01194 promoted TNBC progression. Through bioinformatics prediction, mass spectrometry, and mechanical experiments, we found that LINC01194 could recruit nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1 (NUMA1) to bind to the untranslated region (3&amp;rsquo;UTR) of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 C (UBE2C) 3&amp;rsquo; and stabilize UBE2C mRNA. Moreover, we found that UBE2C acted as an ubiquitin ligase to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of ryanodine receptor type 2 (RYR2) that inhibited the progression of TNBC by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In summary, LINC01194 activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and accelerates the malignant progression of TNBC by recruiting NUMA1 to stabilize UBE2C mRNA and thus promotes RYR2 ubiquitination and degradation. These findings might provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypoxia-inducible lentiviral gene expression in engineered human macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35728871/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35728871/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Human immune cells, including monocyte-derived macrophages, can be engineered to deliver proinflammatory cytokines, bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptors to support immune responses in different disease settings. When gene expression is regulated by constitutively active promoters, lentiviral payload gene expression is unregulated, and can result in potentially toxic quantities of proteins. Regulated delivery of lentivirally encoded proteins may allow localized or conditional therapeutic protein expression to support safe delivery of adoptively transferred, genetically modified cells with reduced capacity for systemic toxicities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we engineered human macrophages to express genes regulated by hypoxia responsive elements included in the lentiviral promoter region to drive conditional lentiviral gene expression only under hypoxic conditions. We tested transduced macrophages cultured in hypoxic conditions for the transient induced expression of reporter genes and the secreted cytokine, interleukin-12. Expression of hypoxia-regulated genes was investigated both transcriptionally and translationally, and in the presence of human tumor cells in a slice culture system. Finally, hypoxia-regulated gene expression was evaluated in a subcutaneous humanized-mouse cancer model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Engineered macrophages were shown to conditionally and tranisently express lentivirally encoded gene protein products, including IL-12 in hypoxic conditions &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. On return to normoxic conditions, lentiviral payload expression returned to basal levels. Reporter genes under the control of hypoxia response elements were upregulated under hypoxic conditions in the presence of human colorectal carcinoma cells and in the hypoxic xenograft model of glioblastoma, suggesting utility for systemic engineered cell delivery capable of localized gene delivery in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Macrophages engineered to express hypoxia-regulated payloads have the potential to be administered systemically and conditionally express proteins in tissues with hypoxic conditions. In contrast to immune cells that function or survive poorly in hypoxic conditions, macrophages maintain a proinflammatory phenotype that may support continued gene and protein expression when regulated by conditional hypoxia responsive elements and naturally traffic to hypoxic microenvironments, making them ideal vehicles for therapeutic payloads to hypoxic tissues, such as solid tumors. With the ability to fine-tune delivery of potent proteins in response to endogenous microenvironments, macrophage-based cellular therapies may therefore be designed for different disease settings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An mTOR and DNA-PK dual inhibitor CC-115 hinders non-small cell lung cancer cell growth</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35717530/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecularly-targeted agents are still urgently needed for better non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy. CC-115 is a potent DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) dual blocker. We evaluated its activity in different human NSCLC cells. In various primary human NSCLC cells and A549 cells, CC-115 potently inhibited viability, cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and hindered cell migration/invasion. Apoptosis was provoked in CC-115-stimulated NSCLC cells. The dual inhibitor, however, was unable to induce significant cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activity in the lung epithelial cells. In primary NSCLC cells, CC-115 blocked activation of mTORC1/2 and DNA-PK. Yet, CC-115-induced primary NSCLC cell death was more potent than combined inhibition of DNA-PK plus mTOR. Further studies found that CC-115 provoked robust oxidative injury in primary NSCLC cells, which appeared independent of mTOR-DNA-PK dual blockage. In vivo studies showed that CC-115 oral administration in nude mice remarkably suppressed primary NSCLC cell xenograft growth. In CC-115-treated NSCLC xenograft tissues, mTOR-DNA-PK dual inhibition and oxidative injury were detected. Together, CC-115 potently inhibits NSCLC cell growth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors is mediated by BRAF splicing variants in BRAF V600E mutation-positive colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35724767/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BRAF inhibitor resistant CRC-NEC cell line was established from patient derived cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BRAF splicing variants were found in the BRAF inhibitor resistant CRC-NEC cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MEK or ERK inhibitor can overcome the BRAF splicing variant mediated resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), a poorly differentiated subtype of neuroendocrine neoplasms, are aggressive and have a poor prognosis. Colorectal neuroendocrine carcinomas (CRC-NECs) are observed in about 0.6% of all patients with CRC. Interestingly, patients with CRC-NECs show higher frequencies of BRAF mutation than typical CRC. BRAF V600E mutation-positive CRC-NECs were shown to be sensitive to BRAF inhibitors and now are treated by BRAF inhibitors. Similar to the other BRAF V600E mutated cancers, resistances against BRAF inhibitors have been observed, but the resistance mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we established BRAF V600E mutated CRC-NEC cell line directly from surgical specimens and experimentally obtained BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib resistant cell lines. The resistant cells are revealed to express at least three types of BRAF splicing variants harboring V600E-mutation, and contribute to RAF/MEK/ERK pathway activation. In these cells, MEK and ERK inhibitors but not dabrafenib significantly suppressed cell growth and survival. Thus, in BRAF V600E mutation-positive CRC-NECs, BRAF splicing variants activate the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and contribute to acquire BRAF inhibitor resistance. Hence, MEK or ERK are potential therapeutic targets to overcome BRAF resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long non-coding RNA MIR4435-2HG: a key molecule in progression of cancer and non-cancerous disorders</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35715800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIR4435-2HG (LINC00978) is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that acts as an oncogene in almost all cancers. This lncRNA participates in the molecular cascades involved in other disorders such as coronary artery diseases, osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and periodontitis. MIR4435-2HG exerts its functions via the spectrum of different mechanisms, including inhibition of apoptosis, sponging microRNAs (miRNAs), promoting cell proliferation, increasing cell invasion and migration, and enhancing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). MIR4435-2HG can regulate several signaling pathways, including Wnt, TGF-β/SMAD, Nrf2/HO-1, PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, and FAK/AKT/β‑catenin signaling pathways; therefore, it can lead to tumor progression. In the present review, we aimed to discuss the potential roles of lncRNA MIR4435-2HG in developing cancerous and non-cancerous conditions. Due to its pivotal role in different disorders, this lncRNA can serve as a potential biomarker in future investigations. Moreover, it may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating tissue factor-positive extracellular vesicles and their association with thrombosis in different diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35708588/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue factor (TF) is a procoagulant protein released from activated host cells, such as monocytes, and tumor cells on extracellular vesicles (EVs). TF + EVs are observed in the circulation of patients with various types of diseases. In this review, we will summarize the association between TF + EVs and activation of coagulation and survival in different types of diseases, including cancer, sepsis, and infections with different viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus (IAV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We will also discuss the source of TF + EVs in various diseases. EVTF activity is associated with thrombosis in pancreatic cancer patients and coronavirus disease 2019 patients (COVID-19) and with disseminated intravascular coagulation in cancer patients. EVTF activity is also associated with worse survival in patients with cancer and COVID-19. Monocytes are the major sources of TF + EVs in sepsis, and viral infections, such as HIV, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, alveolar epithelial cells are the major source of TF + EVs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in COVID-19 and influenza A patients. These studies indicate that EVTF activity could be used as a biomarker to identify patients that have an increased risk of coagulopathy and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dual inhibition of TGFβ signaling and CSF1/CSF1R reprograms tumor-infiltrating macrophages and improves response to chemotherapy via suppressing PD-L1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TGF promotes resistance to chemotherapy in CRC via PD-L1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemotherapy-treated cancer cells secrete CSF1 to recruit M2-TAMs for TGF production within tumor microenvironment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dual inhibition on CSF1R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; M2-TAMs recruitment and TGF signaling increases the response to chemotherapy in CRC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TGFβ contributes to chemoresistance in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) via diverse immune-microenvironment mechanisms. Here, we found that cancer cell autonomous TGFβ directly triggered tumor programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) upregulation, resulting in resistance to chemotherapy. Inhibition of tumor PD-L1 expression sensitized cancer cells to chemotherapy, reduced lung metastasis and increased the influx of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. However, chemorefractory cancer cell-derived CSF1 recruited TAMs for TGFβ-mediated PD-L1 upregulation via a vicious cycle. High infiltration of macrophages was clinically correlated with the status of tumor PD-L1 after chemotherapy treatment in CRC patients. We found that depletion of immunosuppressive CSF1R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; TAM infiltration and blockade of the TGFβ receptor resulted in an increased influx of cytotoxic CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T and effector memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells, a reduction in regulatory T cells, and a synergistic inhibition of tumor growth when combined with chemotherapy. These findings show that CSF1R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; TAMs and TGFβ are the dominant components that regulate PD-L1 expression within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, providing a therapeutic strategy for advanced CRC patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dynamic Chromatin States Coupling with Key Transcription Factors in Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is one of the critical risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanisms for transition from colitis to CRC remain elusive. Recently, epigenetic changes have emerged as important regulatory factors for colitis-associated cancer. Here, a systematic epigenomic study of histone modifications is performed, including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, in an AOM-DSS-induced CRC mouse model. In combination with transcriptomic data, the authors generate a dataset of 105 deep sequencing files and illustrate the dynamic landscape of chromatin states at five time points during inflammation-cancer transition. Functional gene clusters are identified based on dynamic transcriptomic and epigenomic information, and key signaling pathways in the process are illustrated. This study&amp;rsquo;s results reveal that enhancer state regions play important roles during inflammation-cancer transition. It predicts novel transcription factors based on enhancer information, and experimentally proves OTX2 as a critical tumor suppressive transcription factor. Taken together, this study provides comprehensive epigenomic data and reveals novel molecular mechanisms for colitis-associated cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2 nm) easily penetrate the membranes of intestinal murine epithelial cells (MODE-K) and colorectal cancer cells (CT-26). They are also taken up by 3D spheroids (400 µm) of these cell types and primary gut organoids (500 µm). In contrast, dissolved dyes are not taken up by any of these cells or 3D structures. The distribution of fluorescent ultrasmall gold nanoparticles inside cells, spheroids, and gut organoids is examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Nanoparticles conjugated with the cytostatic drug doxorubicin and a fluorescent dye exhibit significantly greater cytotoxicity toward CT-26 tumor spheroids than equally concentrated dissolved doxorubicin, probably because they enter the interior of a spheroid much more easily than dissolved doxorubicin. Comprehensive analyses show that the cellular uptake of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles occurs by different endocytosis pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TWIST1 methylation by SETD6 selectively antagonizes LINC-PINT expression in glioma</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gliomas are one of the most common and lethal brain tumors among adults. One process that contributes to glioma progression and recurrence is the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is regulated by a set of defined transcription factors which tightly regulate this process, among them is the basic helix-loop-helix family member, TWIST1. Here we show that TWIST1 is methylated on lysine-33 at chromatin by SETD6, a methyltransferase with expression levels correlating with poor survival in glioma patients. RNA-seq analysis in U251 glioma cells suggested that both SETD6 and TWIST1 regulate cell adhesion and migration processes. We further show that TWIST1 methylation attenuates the expression of the long-non-coding RNA, LINC-PINT, thereby promoting EMT in glioma. Mechanistically, TWIST1 methylation represses the transcription of LINC-PINT by increasing the occupancy of EZH2 and the catalysis of the repressive H3K27me3 mark at the LINC-PINT locus. Under un-methylated conditions, TWIST1 dissociates from the LINC-PINT locus, allowing the expression of LINC-PINT which leads to increased cell adhesion and decreased cell migration. Together, our findings unravel a new mechanistic dimension for selective expression of LINC-PINT mediated by TWIST1 methylation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An ultra-sensitive assay using cell-free DNA fragmentomics for multi-cancer early detection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early detection can benefit cancer patients with more effective treatments and better prognosis, but existing early screening tests are limited, especially for multi-cancer detection. This study investigated the most prevalent and lethal cancer types, including primary liver cancer (PLC), colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Leveraging the emerging cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomics, we developed a robust machine learning model for multi-cancer early detection. 1,214 participants, including 381 PLC, 298 CRC, 292 LUAD patients, and 243 healthy volunteers, were enrolled. The majority of patients (N = 971) were at early stages (stage 0, N = 34; stage I, N = 799). The participants were randomly divided into a training cohort and a test cohort in a 1:1 ratio while maintaining the ratio for the major histology subtypes. An ensemble stacked machine learning approach was developed using multiple plasma cfDNA fragmentomic features. The model was trained solely in the training cohort and then evaluated in the test cohort. Our model showed an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.983 for differentiating cancer patients from healthy individuals. At 95.0% specificity, the sensitivity of detecting all cancer reached 95.5%, while 100%, 94.6%, and 90.4% for PLC, CRC, and LUAD, individually. The cancer origin model demonstrated an overall 93.1% accuracy for predicting cancer origin in the test cohort (97.4%, 94.3%, and 85.6% for PLC, CRC, and LUAD, respectively). Our model sensitivity is consistently high for early-stage and small-size tumors. Furthermore, its detection and origin classification power remained superior when reducing sequencing depth to 1× (cancer detection: ≥ 91.5% sensitivity at 95.0% specificity; cancer origin: ≥ 91.6% accuracy). In conclusion, we have incorporated plasma cfDNA fragmentomics into the ensemble stacked model and established an ultrasensitive assay for multi-cancer early detection, shedding light on developing cancer early screening in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A signature for pan-cancer prognosis based on neutrophil extracellular traps</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35688556/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35688556/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were originally thought to be formed by neutrophils to trap invading microorganisms as a defense mechanism. Increasing studies have shown that NETs play a pivotal role in tumor progression and diffusion. In this case, transcriptome analysis provides an opportunity to unearth the association between NETs and clinical outcomes of patients with pan-cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The transcriptome sequencing data of The Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer primary focus was obtained from UCSC Xena, and a 19-gene NETs score was then constructed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox regression model based on the expression levels of 69 NETs initial biomarkers we collected from multistudies. In addition, multiple datasets covering multiple cancer types from other databases were collected and used to validate the signature. Gene ontology enrichment analyses were used to annotate the functions of NETs-related pathways. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was implemented to evaluate the role of NETs-related genes in clinical patients across types of tumors, including lung adenocarcinoma (n=58), colorectal carcinoma (n=93), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (n=90), and triple-negative breast cancer (n=80).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The NETs score was calculated based on 19-NETs related genes according to the LASSO Cox model. The NETs score was considered a hazardous factor in most cancer types, with a higher score indicating a more adverse outcome. In addition, we found that NETs were significantly correlated to various malignant biological processes, such as the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (R=0.7444, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), angiogenesis (R=0.5369, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), and tumor cell proliferation (R=0.3835, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Furthermore, in IHC cohorts of a variety of tumors, myeloperoxidase, a gene involved in the model and a classical delegate of NETs formation, was associated with poor clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, these constitutive and complementary biomarkers represented the ability of NETs formation to predict the development of patients&amp;rsquo; progression. Integrative transcriptome analyses plus clinical sample validation may facilitate the biomarker discovery and clinical transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ATR-mediated CD47 and PD-L1 up-regulation restricts radiotherapy-induced immune priming and abscopal responses in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35687697/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiotherapy (RT) of colorectal cancer (CRC) can prime adaptive immunity against tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-expressing CRC cells systemically. However, abscopal tumor remissions are extremely rare, and the postirradiation immune escape mechanisms in CRC remain elusive. Here, we found that irradiated CRC cells used ATR-mediated DNA repair signaling pathway to up-regulate both CD47 and PD-L1, which through engagement of SIRPα and PD-1, respectively, prevented phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells and thereby limited TAA cross-presentation and innate immune activation. This postirradiation CD47 and PD-L1 up-regulation was observed across various human solid tumor cells. Concordantly, rectal cancer patients with poor responses to neoadjuvant RT exhibited significantly elevated postirradiation CD47 levels. The combination of RT, anti-SIRPα, and anti-PD-1 reversed adaptive immune resistance and drove efficient TAA cross-presentation, resulting in robust TAA-specific CD8 T cell priming, functional activation of T effectors, and increased T cell clonality and clonal diversity. We observed significantly higher complete response rates to RT/anti-SIRPα/anti-PD-1 in both irradiated and abscopal tumors and prolonged survival in three distinct murine CRC models, including a cecal orthotopic model. The efficacy of triple combination therapy was STING dependent as knockout animals lost most benefit of adding anti-SIRPα and anti-PD-1 to RT. Despite activation across the myeloid stroma, the enhanced dendritic cell function accounts for most improvements in CD8 T cell priming. These data suggest ATR-mediated CD47 and PD-L1 up-regulation as a key mechanism restraining radiation-induced immune priming. RT combined with SIRPα and PD-1 blockade promotes robust antitumor immune priming, leading to systemic tumor regressions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CREB1 contributes colorectal cancer cell plasticity by regulating lncRNA CCAT1 and NF-κB pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35696016/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CREB1 gene encodes an exceptionally pleiotropic transcription factor that frequently dysregulated in human cancers. CREB1 can regulate tumor cell status of proliferation and/or migration; however, the molecular basis for this switch involvement in cell plasticity has not fully been understood yet. Here, we first show that knocking out CREB1 triggers a remarkable effect of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and leads to the occurrence of inhibited proliferation and enhanced motility in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. By monitoring 45 cellular signaling pathway activities, we find that multiple growth-related pathways decline significantly while inflammatory pathways including NF-κB are largely upregulated in comparing between the CREB1 wild-type and knocked out cells. Mechanistically, cells with CREB1 knocked out show downregulation of MYC as a result of impaired CREB1-dependent transcription of the oncogenic lncRNA CCAT1. Interestingly, the unbalanced competition between the coactivator CBP/p300 for CREB1 and p65 leads to the activation of the NF-κB pathway in cells with CREB1 disrupted, which induces an obvious EMT phenotype of the cancer cells. Taken together, these studies identify previously unknown mechanisms of CREB1 in CRC cell plasticity via regulating lncRNA CCAT1 and NF-κB pathways, providing a critical insight into a combined strategy for CREB1-targeted tumor therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Combination treatment with 17β-estradiol and anti-PD-L1 suppresses MC38 tumor growth by reducing PD-L1 expression and enhancing M1 macrophage population in MC38 colon tumor model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35690286/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17β-estradiol is known to have a protective effect in colon cancer development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sex differences exist in MC38 tumor growth, PD-L1 expression, and cell populations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17β-estradiol treatment before MC38 injection reduced high cell types in males.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synergistic effect of 17β-estradiol on anti-tumorigenic effect of anti-PD-L1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17β-estradiol (E2) is known to have a protective effect in colorectal cancer (CRC); thus, E2 may be effective for cancer immunotherapy in CRC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of combination therapy with E2 and anti-programmed cell death receptor-1 ligand (PD-L1) antibodies, and the effects of sex and estrogen on colon tumor growth, PD-L1 expression, and tumor-associated cell populations in an MC38 colon tumor model. Male mice showed increased MC38 colon tumor growth and PD-L1 expression in tumor sections as well as higher proportion of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CD45-CD31-CD140a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), PD-L1-expressing tumor cells (CD45-CD274&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD274&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to female mice. E2 treatment prior to MC38 injection significantly reduced these phenomena in male mice. Furthermore, co-treatment with E2 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies significantly inhibited MC38 tumor growth and reduced PD-L1-expressing cells in male mice compared to treatment with either E2 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies alone. Combination treatment with E2 and anti-PD-L1 decreased TAM population (CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in the tumor mass while increasing M1 TMAs (CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD86&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). These results suggest that estrogen inhibits MC38 tumor growth by downregulating PD-L1 expression and regulating tumor-associated cell populations. Furthermore, estrogen boosted the effect of anti-PD-L1 antibody in the MC38 tumor model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RNF43 G659fs is an oncogenic colorectal cancer mutation and sensitizes tumor cells to PI3K/mTOR inhibition</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35676246/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;/em&gt;-p.G659fs mutation occurs frequently in colorectal cancer, but its function remains poorly understood and there are no specific therapies directed against this alteration. In this study, we find that &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;/em&gt;-p.G659fs promotes cell growth independent of Wnt signaling. We perform a drug repurposing library screen and discover that cells with &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;/em&gt;-p.G659 mutations are selectively killed by inhibition of PI3K signaling. PI3K/mTOR inhibitors yield promising antitumor activity in &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;sup&gt;659mut&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; isogenic cell lines and xenograft models, as well as in patient-derived organoids harboring &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;/em&gt;-p.G659fs mutations. We find that &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;sup&gt;659mut&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; binds p85 leading to increased PI3K signaling through p85 ubiquitination and degradation. Additionally, RNA-sequencing of &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;sup&gt;659mut&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; isogenic cells reveals decreased interferon response gene expression, that is reversed by PI3K/mTOR inhibition, suggesting that &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;sup&gt;659mut&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; may alter tumor immunity. Our findings suggest a therapeutic application for PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in treating &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;/em&gt;-p.G659fs mutant cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Association of Physician Adenoma Detection Rates With Postcolonoscopy Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35670788/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35670788/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Importance:&lt;/em&gt; Although colonoscopy is frequently performed in the United States, there is limited evidence to support threshold values for physician adenoma detection rate as a quality metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To evaluate the association between physician adenoma detection rate values and risks of postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer and related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design, setting, and participants:&lt;/em&gt; Retrospective cohort study in 3 large integrated health care systems (Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and Kaiser Permanente Washington) with 43 endoscopy centers, 383 eligible physicians, and 735 396 patients aged 50 to 75 years who received a colonoscopy that did not detect cancer (negative colonoscopy) between January 2011 and June 2017, with patient follow-up through December 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exposures:&lt;/em&gt; The adenoma detection rate of each patient&amp;rsquo;s physician based on screening examinations in the calendar year prior to the patient&amp;rsquo;s negative colonoscopy. Adenoma detection rate was defined as a continuous variable in statistical analyses and was also dichotomized as at or above vs below the median for descriptive analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main outcomes and measures:&lt;/em&gt; The primary outcome (postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer) was tumor registry-verified colorectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed at least 6 months after any negative colonoscopy (all indications). The secondary outcomes included death from postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Among 735 396 patients who had 852 624 negative colonoscopies, 440 352 (51.6%) were performed on female patients, median patient age was 61.4 years (IQR, 55.5-67.2 years), median follow-up per patient was 3.25 years (IQR, 1.56-5.01 years), and there were 619 postcolonoscopy colorectal cancers and 36 related deaths during more than 2.4 million person-years of follow-up. The patients of physicians with higher adenoma detection rates had significantly lower risks for postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97 per 1% absolute adenoma detection rate increase [95% CI, 0.96-0.98]) and death from postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer (HR, 0.95 per 1% absolute adenoma detection rate increase [95% CI, 0.92-0.99]) across a broad range of adenoma detection rate values, with no interaction by sex (P value for interaction = .18). Compared with adenoma detection rates below the median of 28.3%, detection rates at or above the median were significantly associated with a lower risk of postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer (1.79 vs 3.10 cases per 10 000 person-years; absolute difference in 7-year risk, -12.2 per 10 000 negative colonoscopies [95% CI, -10.3 to -13.4]; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.52-0.73]) and related deaths (0.05 vs 0.22 cases per 10 000 person-years; absolute difference in 7-year risk, -1.2 per 10 000 negative colonoscopies [95%, CI, -0.80 to -1.69]; HR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.11-0.65]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions and relevance:&lt;/em&gt; Within 3 large community-based settings, colonoscopies by physicians with higher adenoma detection rates were significantly associated with lower risks of postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer across a broad range of adenoma detection rate values. These findings may help inform recommended targets for colonoscopy quality measures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the American Gastroenterological Association&amp;rsquo;s Center for GI Innovation and Technology convened a consensus conference, entitled &amp;ldquo;Colorectal Cancer Screening and Surveillance: Role of Emerging Technology and Innovation to Improve Outcomes.&amp;rdquo; The conference participants, which included more than 60 experts in colorectal cancer, considered recent improvements in colorectal cancer screening rates and polyp detection, persistent barriers to colonoscopy uptake, and opportunities for performance improvement and innovation. This white paper originates from that conference. It aims to summarize current patient- and physician-centered gaps and challenges in colonoscopy, diagnostic and therapeutic challenges affecting colonoscopy uptake, and the potential use of emerging technologies and quality metrics to improve patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clonality and timing of relapsing colorectal cancer metastasis revealed through whole-genome single-cell sequencing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35688262/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35688262/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phylogenetic analysis of single-cells exposes how, where and when malignant cells survive treatment in a personalized manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The relapse originated from the expansion of a single metastatic lineage that slowly evolved in the liver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than 500 mutations are specific to the relapse, including four non-silent mutations with no apparent clinical significance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a clear contribution of chemotherapy exposure to the overall mutational burden of the relapse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recurrence of tumor cells following local and systemic therapy is a significant hurdle in cancer. Most patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) will relapse, despite resection of the metastatic lesions. A better understanding of the evolutionary history of recurrent lesions is required to identify the spatial and temporal patterns of metastatic progression and expose the genetic and evolutionary determinants of therapeutic resistance. With this goal in mind, here we leveraged a unique single-cell whole-genome sequencing dataset from recurrent hepatic lesions of an mCRC patient. Our phylogenetic analysis confirms that the treatment induced a severe demographic bottleneck in the liver metastasis but also that a previously diverged lineage survived this surgery, possibly after migration to a different site in the liver. This lineage evolved very slowly for two years under adjuvant drug therapy and diversified again in a very short period. We identified several non-silent mutations specific to this lineage and inferred a substantial contribution of chemotherapy to the overall, genome-wide mutational burden. All in all, our study suggests that mCRC subclones can migrate locally and evade resection, keep evolving despite rounds of chemotherapy, and re-expand explosively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomes deliver lncRNA DARS-AS1 siRNA to inhibit chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced TNBC metastasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35688263/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exosomes are natural nanocarriers for efficient delivery of siRNA to recipient cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SiRNA-loaded exosomes were performed by modified calcium-mediated transfection method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SiRNA-loaded exosomes demonstrated dose-dependent knockdown efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SiRNA-loaded exosomes showed strong antitumor activity on TNBC cells in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SiRNA-loaded exosomes intensively inhibited TNBC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a rapidly recurring and highly metastatic malignancy with high heterogeneity and chemoradiotherapy resistance. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) can induce the occurrence of tumors and enhance lymphatic infiltration and distant metastasis through direct interaction with the sympathetic nervous system; however, its relevance in TNBC is yet to be clarified. In this study, DARS-AS1, a newly reported CUMS-responsive lncRNA, was found to be enriched in TNBC clinical tumors and cells and positively correlated with late clinical stage in patients with TNBC. DARS-AS1 overexpression significantly enhanced the migration and invasion of TNBC tumors by inhibiting miR-129-2-3p and upregulated CDK1 to activate the NF-κB/STAT3 signaling pathway both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Treatment with DARS-AS1 siRNA-loaded exosomes (EXOs) substantially slowed CUMS-induced TNBC cell growth and liver metastasis. Therefore, DARS-AS1 represents a potential therapeutic target for metastatic TNBC, and EXOs may serve as siRNA delivery carriers in clinical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loss of MMR and TGFBR2 Increases the Susceptibility to Microbiota-Dependent Inflammation-Associated Colon Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35688320/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35688320/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes are causative in Lynch syndrome and a significant proportion of sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs). MMR-deficient (dMMR) CRCs display increased mutation rates, with mutations frequently accumulating at short repetitive DNA sequences throughout the genome (microsatellite instability). The TGFBR2 gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in dMMR CRCs. Therefore, we generated an animal model to study how the loss of both TGFBR2 signaling impacts dMMR-driven intestinal tumorigenesis in vivo and explore the impact of the gut microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We generated VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice in which Msh2loxP and Tgfbr2loxP alleles are inactivated by Villin-Cre recombinase in the intestinal epithelium. VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice were analyzed for their rate of intestinal cancer development and for the mutational spectra and gene expression profiles of tumors. In addition, we assessed the impact of chemically induced chronic inflammation and gut microbiota composition on colorectal tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice developed small intestinal adenocarcinomas and CRCs with histopathological features highly similar to CRCs in Lynch syndrome patients. The CRCs in VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice were associated with the presence of colitis and displayed genetic and histological features that resembled inflammation-associated CRCs in human patients. The development of CRCs in VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice was strongly modulated by the gut microbiota composition, which in turn was impacted by the TGFBR2 status of the tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results demonstrate a synergistic interaction between MMR and TGFBR2 inactivation in inflammation-associated colon tumorigenesis and highlight the crucial impact of the gut microbiota on modulating the incidence of inflammation-associated CRCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell RNA-seq-based proteogenomics identifies glioblastoma-specific transposable elements encoding HLA-I-presented peptides</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35675780/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transposable elements (TEs) allow all cell population discrimination in glioblastoma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TE-derived peptides are presented on HLA-I molecules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TE subfamilies redundantly share HLA-I-presented peptide coding sequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-redundant peptide-coding TEs are more tumor-specific targets for immunotherapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyze transposable elements (TEs) in glioblastoma (GBM) patients using a proteogenomic pipeline that combines single-cell transcriptomics, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) samples from tumors and healthy-tissue cohorts, and immunopeptidomic samples. We thus identify 370 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I-bound peptides encoded by TEs differentially expressed in GBM. Some of the peptides are encoded by repeat sequences from intact open reading frames (ORFs) present in up to several hundred TEs from recent long interspersed nuclear element (LINE)-1, long terminal repeat (LTR), and SVA subfamilies. Other HLA-I-bound peptides are encoded by single copies of TEs from old subfamilies that are expressed recurrently in GBM tumors and not expressed, or very infrequently and at low levels, in healthy tissues (including brain). These peptide-coding, GBM-specific, highly recurrent TEs represent potential tumor-specific targets for cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stress-induced epinephrine promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness of CRC through the CEBPB/TRIM2/P53 axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35672760/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Previous studies have indicated that chronic emotional stressors likely participate in the occurrence of cancers. However, direct evidence connecting stress and colorectal cancer development remains almost completely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic stress mouse model was used to investigate the influence of stress on tumorigenesis. Several major agonists and antagonists of adrenergic receptors were applied to investigate the effects of β-adrenergic signaling on the development of CRC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (CHIP) were used to investigate the binding of p53 and CEBPB to TRIM2 promoter. Mammosphere cultures, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony-formation assay, scratch wound healing assays, qPCR, immunofluorescence, coimmunoprecipitation and western blotting were used to explore the effect of stress-induced epinephrine on the CEBPB/TRIM2/P53 axis and the progress of CRC cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we found that stress-induced epinephrine (EPI) promotes the proliferation, metastasis and CSC generation of CRC primarily through the β2-adrenergic receptor. Furthermore, our studies also confirmed that chronic stress decreased the stability of p53 protein by promoting p53 ubiquitination. Results of transcriptome sequencing indicated that TRIM2 was overexpressed in cells treated with EPI. Further studies indicated that TRIM2 could regulate the stability of p53 protein by promoting p53 ubiquitination. Finally, we further proved that CEBPB was regulated by EPI and acts as the upstream transcription factor of TRIM2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our studies proved that stress-induced EPI promotes the development and stemness of CRC through the CEBPB/TRIM2/P53 axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TRIM27 cooperates with STK38L to inhibit ULK1-mediated autophagy and promote tumorigenesis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35670107/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy represents a fundamental mechanism for maintaining cell survival and tissue homeostasis in response to physiological and pathological stress. Autophagy initiation converges on the FIP200-ATG13-ULK1 complex wherein the serine/threonine kinase ULK1 plays a central role. Here, we reveal that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM27 functions as a negative regulatory component of the FIP200-ATG13-ULK1 complex. TRIM27 directly polyubiquitinates ULK1 at K568 and K571 sites with K48-linked ubiquitin chains, with proteasomal turnover maintaining control over basal ULK1 levels. However, during starvation-induced autophagy, TRIM27 catalyzes non-degradative K6- and K11-linked ubiquitination of the serine/threonine kinase 38-like (STK38L) kinase. In turn, STK38L ubiquitination promotes its activation and phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser495, rendering ULK1 in a permissive state for TRIM27-mediated hyper-ubiquitination of ULK1. This cooperative mechanism serves to restrain the amplitude and duration of autophagy. Further evidence from mouse models shows that basal autophagy levels are increased in Trim27 knockout mice and that Trim27 differentially regulates tumorigenesis and metastasis. Our study identifies a key role of STK38L-TRIM27-ULK1 signaling axis in negatively controlling autophagy with relevance established in human breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CircCEMIP promotes anoikis-resistance by enhancing protective autophagy in prostate cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35655258/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are essential participants in the development and progression of various malignant tumors. Previous studies have shown that cell migration-inducing protein (CEMIP) accelerates prostate cancer (PCa) anoikis resistance (AR) by activating autophagy. This study focused on the effect of circCEMIP on PCa metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; This study gradually revealed the role of circ_0004585 in PCa anoikis resistance via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, western blotting, pull-down assays, and dual fluorescence reporter assays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Functionally, circ_0004585 promoted PCa cells invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circ_0004585 directly interacted with miR-1248 to upregulate target gene expression. Furthermore, target prediction and dual-luciferase reporter assays identified transmembrane 9 superfamily member 4 (TM9SF4) as a potential miR-1248 target. Pathway analysis revealed that TM9SF4 activated autophagy to promote PCa cells anoikis resistance via mTOR phosphorylation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These results demonstrated that circ_0004585 played an oncogenic role during PCa invasion and metastasis by targeting the miR-1248/TM9SF4 axis while providing new insight into therapeutic strategy development for metastatic PCa.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Implications of Hyperoxia over the Tumor Microenvironment: An Overview Highlighting the Importance of the Immune System</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35681719/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperoxia is used in order to counteract hypoxia effects in the TME (tumor microenvironment), which are described to boost the malignant tumor phenotype and poor prognosis. The reduction of tumor hypoxic state through the formation of a non-aberrant vasculature or an increase in the toxicity of the therapeutic agent improves the efficacy of therapies such as chemotherapy. Radiotherapy efficacy has also improved, where apoptotic mechanisms seem to be implicated. Moreover, hyperoxia increases the antitumor immunity through diverse pathways, leading to an immunopermissive TME. Although hyperoxia is an approved treatment for preventing and treating hypoxemia, it has harmful side-effects. Prolonged exposure to high oxygen levels may cause acute lung injury, characterized by an exacerbated immune response, and the destruction of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Furthermore, under this situation, the high concentration of ROS may cause toxicity that will lead not only to cell death but also to an increase in chemoattractant and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. This would end in a lung leukocyte recruitment and, therefore, lung damage. Moreover, unregulated inflammation causes different consequences promoting tumor development and metastasis. This process is known as protumor inflammation, where different cell types and molecules are implicated; for instance, IL-1β has been described as a key cytokine. Although current results show benefits over cancer therapies using hyperoxia, further studies need to be conducted, not only to improve tumor regression, but also to prevent its collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intracellular complement C5a/C5aR1 stabilizes β-catenin to promote colorectal tumorigenesis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colonic epithelial cells contain intracellular stores of complement C5 and C5aR1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cathepsin D cleaves C5 to produce C5a in lysosomes and endosomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The C5a/C5aR1/KCTD5/cullin3/Roc-1 complex potentiates β-catenin stability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genetic loss or pharmacological blockade of C5aR1 impedes colorectal tumorigenesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complement is operative in not only the extracellular but also the intracellular milieu. However, little is known about the role of complement activation inside tumor cells. Here, we report that intracellular C5 is cleaved by cathepsin D (CTSD) to produce C5a in lysosomes and endosomes of colonic cancer cells. After stimulation by C5a, intracellular C5aR1 assembles a complex with KCTD5/cullin3/Roc-1 and β-catenin to promote the switch of polyubiquitination of β-catenin from K48 to K63, which enhances β-catenin stability. Genetic loss or pharmacological blockade of C5aR1 dramatically impedes colorectal tumorigenesis at least by destabilizing β-catenin. In human colorectal cancer specimens, high levels of C5aR1, C5a, and CTSD are closely correlated with elevated β-catenin levels and a poor prognosis. Importantly, intracellular C5a/C5aR1-mediated β-catenin stabilization is also observed ubiquitously in other cell types. Collectively, we identify a machinery for β-catenin activation and provide a potential target for tumor prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound IIc is a novel and effective highly TRAIL-sensitive HDAC inhibitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IIc mediated HCT-116 cell apoptosis through the TRAIL-induced apoptosis signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IIc showed good antitumor efficacy in HCT-116 xenograft model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activation of the TRAIL proapoptotic pathway can promote cancer cell apoptosis. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) also are promising drug targets for cancers, and their synergistic effect with TRAIL can improve the inhibitory effect on cancer cells. Therefore, the development of highly TRAIL-sensitive HDAC inhibitors might be a promising strategy for the treatment of cancers. We synthesized a series of HDAC inhibitors by introducing effective fragments sensitive to TRAIL. Compound IIc showed good inhibitory activity against HDAC1 and HCT116 cells and showed higher sensitivity to activating the expression of the TRAIL protein and promoting the apoptosis of HCT-116 cells compared with ONC201. The inhibitory activity of compound IIc (25 mg/kg) in the HCT-116 xenograft model was significantly greater than those of the positive control drugs (ONC201, chidamide). These findings suggested that development of highly TRAIL-sensitive HDAC inhibitors as colorectal tumor cancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting ferroptosis as a vulnerability in cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35338310/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death that is triggered by the toxic build-up of lipid peroxides on cellular membranes. In recent years, ferroptosis has garnered enormous interest in cancer research communities, partly because it is a unique cell death modality that is mechanistically and morphologically different from other forms of cell death, such as apoptosis, and therefore holds great potential for cancer therapy. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of ferroptosis-inducing and ferroptosis defence mechanisms, dissect the roles and mechanisms of ferroptosis in tumour suppression and tumour immunity, conceptualize the diverse vulnerabilities of cancer cells to ferroptosis, and explore therapeutic strategies for targeting ferroptosis in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Perspectives of using microRNA-loaded nanocarriers for epigenetic reprogramming of drug resistant colorectal cancers</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35623562/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic regulation by microRNAs (miRs) demonstrated a promising therapeutic potential of these molecules to regulate genetic activity in different cancers, including colorectal cancers (CRCs). The RNA-based therapy does not change genetic codes in tumor cells but can silence oncogenes and/or reactivate inhibited tumor suppressor genes. In many cancers, specific miRs were shown to promote or stop tumor progression. Among confirmed and powerful epigenetic regulators of colon carcinogenesis and development of resistance are onco-miRs, which include let-7, miR-21, miR-22, miR-23a, miR-27a, miR-34, miR-92, miR-96, miR-125b, miR-135b, miR-182, miR-200c, miR-203, miR-221, miR-421, miR-451, and others. Moreover, various tumor-suppressor miRs (miR-15b-5b, miR-18a, miR-20b, miR-22, miR-96, miR-139-5p, miR-145, miR-149, miR-197, miR-199b, miR-203, miR-214, miR-218, miR-320, miR-375-3p, miR-409-3p, miR-450b-5p, miR-494, miR-577, miR-874, and others) were found silenced in drug-resistant CRCs. Re-expression of tumor suppressor miR is complicated by the chemical nature of miRs that are not long-lasting compounds and require protection from the enzymatic degradation. Several recent studies explored application of miRs using nanocarrier complexes. This study critically describes the most successfully tested nanoparticle complexes used for intracellular delivery of nuclear acids and miRs, including micelles, liposomes, inorganic and polymeric NPs, dendrimers, and aptamers. Nanocarriers shield incorporated miRs and improve the agent stability in circulation. Attachment of antibodies and/or specific peptide or ligands facilitates cell-targeted miR delivery. Addressing in vivo challenges, a broad spectrum of non-toxic materials has been tested and indicated reliable advantages of lipid-based (lipoplexes) and polymer-based liposomes. Recent cutting-edge developments indicated that lipid-based complexes with multiple cargo, including several miRs, are the most effective approach to eradicate drug-resistant tumors. Focusing on CRC-specific miRs, this review provides a guidance and insights towards the most promising direction to achieve dramatic reduction in tumor growth and metastasis using miR-nanocarrier complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The neuronal tyrosine kinase receptor ligand ALKAL2 mediates persistent pain</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35608912/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase known for its oncogenic potential that is involved in the development of the peripheral and central nervous system. ALK receptor ligands ALKAL1 and ALKAL2 were recently found to promote neuronal differentiation and survival. Here, we show that inflammation or injury enhanced ALKAL2 expression in a subset of TRPV1+ sensory neurons. Notably, ALKAL2 was particularly enriched in both mouse and human peptidergic nociceptors, yet weakly expressed in nonpeptidergic, large-diameter myelinated neurons or in the brain. Using a coculture expression system, we found that nociceptors exposed to ALKAL2 exhibited heightened excitability and neurite outgrowth. Intraplantar CFA or intrathecal infusion of recombinant ALKAL2 led to ALK phosphorylation in the lumbar dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Finally, depletion of ALKAL2 in dorsal root ganglia or blocking ALK with clinically available compounds crizotinib or lorlatinib reversed thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia induced by inflammation or nerve injury, respectively. Overall, our work uncovers the ALKAL2/ALK signaling axis as a central regulator of nociceptor-induced sensitization. We propose that clinically approved ALK inhibitors used for non-small cell lung cancer and neuroblastomas could be repurposed to treat persistent pain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FL118, acting as a &#39;molecular glue degrader&#39;, binds to dephosphorylates and degrades the oncoprotein DDX5 (p68) to control c-Myc, survivin and mutant Kras against colorectal and pancreatic cancer with high efficacy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35604033/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a difficult-to-treat cancer, is expected to become the second-largest cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030, while colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths. Currently, there is no effective treatment for PDAC patients. The development of novel agents to effectively treat these cancers remains an unmet clinical need. FL118, a novel anticancer small molecule, exhibits high efficacy against cancers; however, the direct biochemical target of FL118 is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; FL118 affinity purification, mass spectrometry, Nanosep centrifugal device and isothermal titration calorimetry were used for identifying and confirming FL118 binding to DDX5/p68 and its binding affinity. Immunoprecipitation (IP), western blots, real-time reverse transcription PCR, gene silencing, overexpression (OE) and knockout (KO) were used for analysing gene/protein function and expression. Chromatin IP was used for analysing protein-DNA interactions. The 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromid assay and human PDAC/CRC cell/tumour models were used for determining PDAC/CRC cell/tumour in vitro and in vivo growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We discovered that FL118 strongly binds to dephosphorylates and degrades the DDX5 oncoprotein via the proteasome degradation pathway without decreasing DDX5 mRNA. Silencing and OE of DDX5 indicated that DDX5 is a master regulator for controlling the expression of multiple oncogenic proteins, including survivin, Mcl-1, XIAP, cIAP2, c-Myc and mutant Kras. Genetic manipulation of DDX5 in PDAC cells affects tumour growth. PDAC cells with DDX5 KO are resistant to FL118 treatment. Our human tumour animal model studies further indicated that FL118 exhibits high efficacy to eliminate human PDAC and CRC tumours that have a high expression of DDX5, while FL118 exhibits less effectiveness in PDAC and CRC tumours with low DDX5 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; DDX5 is a bona fide FL118 direct target and can act as a biomarker for predicting PDAC and CRC tumour sensitivity to FL118. This would greatly impact FL118 precision medicine for patients with advanced PDAC or advanced CRC in the clinic. FL118 may act as a &amp;lsquo;molecular glue degrader&amp;rsquo; to directly glue DDX5 and ubiquitination regulators together to degrade DDX5.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zinc finger protein 280C contributes to colorectal tumorigenesis by maintaining epigenetic repression at H3K27me3-marked loci</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35605119/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study uncovered the role of ZNF280C, a known DNA damage response protein, as a tumorigenic transcription regulator that contributes to colorectal tumorigenesis and metastasis through maintaining an epigenetic repression program at key cancer gene loci. These findings identified a contributor with potential prognostic value to colorectal pathogenesis and provide mechanistic insight to the essential function of transcription factor in fine-tuning the activity of chromatin regulators for proper transcription control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulated epigenetic and transcriptional programming due to abnormalities of transcription factors (TFs) contributes to and sustains the oncogenicity of cancer cells. Here, we unveiled the role of zinc finger protein 280C (ZNF280C), a known DNA damage response protein, as a tumorigenic TF in colorectal cancer (CRC), required for colitis-associated carcinogenesis and Apc deficiency–driven intestinal tumorigenesis in mice. Consistently, ZNF280C silencing in human CRC cells inhibited proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, xenograft growth, and liver metastasis. As a C2H2 (Cys2-His2) zinc finger-containing TF, ZNF280C occupied genomic intervals with both transcriptionally active and repressive states and coincided with CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin binding. Notably, ZNF280C was crucial for the repression program of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3)-marked genes and the maintenance of both focal and broad H3K27me3 levels. Mechanistically, ZNF280C counteracted CTCF/cohesin activities and condensed the chromatin environment at the cis elements of certain tumor suppressor genes marked by H3K27me3, at least partially through recruiting the epigenetic repressor structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain-containing 1 (SMCHD1). In clinical relevance, ZNF280C was highly expressed in primary CRCs and distant metastases, and a higher ZNF280C level independently predicted worse prognosis of CRC patients. Thus, our study uncovered a contributor with good prognostic value to CRC pathogenesis and also elucidated the essence of DNA-binding TFs in orchestrating the epigenetic programming of gene regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dual-hairpin ligation amplification enabled ultra-sensitive and selective ATP detection for cancer monitor</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35653851/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The detection is developed from DHLA, a new isothermal amplification technique with ultra-high signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The detection is ultra-sensitive with a ∼fM level sensitivity, being of magnitude lower than previously reported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The detection is ultra-selective to ATP from its analogues, such as GTP, CTP, UTP and adenosine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has been successfully utilized to detect ATP from colon cell line and cell culture medium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abnormal concentration of ATP is related to many diseases such as Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease, hypoglycaemia, inflammation and cancer. However, most of the reported strategies exhibit moderate sensitivity with ∼nM level detection limit and few of them can distinguish ATP from its analogues, such as GTP, CTP, UTP and adenosine. Herein, we report an ultra-sensitive and selective ATP detection strategy that combines dual hairpin ligation-induced isothermal amplification (DHLA) with ATP-dependent enzymatic reaction. A good linear relationship between Cq value and ATP concentration in the range from 16 fM to 160 nM is acquired. Meanwhile, the strategy can distinguish ATP from its analogues with high selectivity. Furthermore, our proposed strategy has been successfully utilized to detect ATP from colon cell line and cell culture media with great potential applications in cell metabolism and cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KMT2B promotes the growth of renal cell carcinoma via upregulation of SNHG12 expression and promotion of CEP55 transcription</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35597996/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; This study aims to clarify the mechanistic action of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SNHG12 in the development of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which may be associated with promoter methylation modification by KMT2B and the regulation of the E2F1/CEP55 axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; TCGA and GEO databases were used to predict the involvement of SNHG12 in RCC. Knockdown of SNHG12/E2F1/CEP55 was performed. Next, SNHG12 expression and other mRNAs were quantified by RT-qPCR. Subsequently, CCK-8 was used to detect cell proliferation. Wound healing assay and Transwell assay were used to detect cell migration and invasion, respectively. The in vitro angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was explored by matrigel-based capillary-like tube formation assay. ChIP assay was used to detect H3K4me3 in SNHG12 promoter region. The binding of E2F1 to CEP55 promoter region was analyzed with ChIP and dual luciferase reporter assays. RIP assay was used to detect the binding of SNHG12 to E2F1. Finally, the effect of SNHG12 on the tumor formation and angiogenesis of RCC was assessed in nude mouse xenograft model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; SNHG12 was highly expressed in RCC tissues and cells, and it was related to the poor prognosis of RCC patients. SNHG12 knockdown significantly inhibited RCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and HUVEC angiogenesis. KMT2B up-regulated SNHG12 expression through modifying H3K4me3 in its promoter region. In addition, SNHG12 promoted CEP55 expression by recruiting the transcription factor E2F1. Knockdown of SNHG12 blocked E2F1 recruitment and down-regulated the expression of CEP55, thereby inhibiting tumor formation and angiogenesis in nude mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The evidence provided by our study highlighted the involvement of KMT2B in up-regulation of lncRNA as well as the transcription of CEP55, resulting in the promotion of angiogenesis and growth of RCC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging role for thymic stromal lymphopoietin-responsive regulatory T cells in colorectal cancer progression in humans and mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35584230/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulating regulatory T cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory T cells (T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt;) are a well-known marker of cancer progression, and the tumor-derived cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is thought to influence the function of T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt; in the tumor microenvironment. Here, Obata-Ninomiya et al. examine this relationship in the context of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis. They saw T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt; expressing the receptor for TSLP that were enriched in the peripheral blood and tumors of patients and mice with CRC. They treated a chemically induced CRC mouse model with TSLP monoclonal antibodies that inhibited the progression of CRC. TSLP represents a potential therapeutic target to regulate T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; function and control CRC progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruitment of regulatory T cells (T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt;) to tumors is a hallmark of cancer progression. Tumor-derived factors, such as the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), can influence T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; function in tumors. In our study, we identified a subset of T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt; expressing the receptor for TSLP (TSLPR+ T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt;) that were increased in colorectal tumors in humans and mice and largely absent in adjacent normal colon. This T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; subset was also found in the peripheral blood of patients with colon cancer but not in the peripheral blood of healthy control subjects. Mechanistically, we found that this T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; subset coexpressed the interleukin-33 (IL-33) receptor [suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2)] and had high programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) expression, regulated in part by the transcription factor Mef2c. T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt;-specific deletion of TSLPR, but not ST2, was associated with a reduction in tumor number and size with concomitant increase in T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 cells in tumors in chemically induced mouse models of colorectal cancer. Therapeutic blockade of TSLP using TSLP-specific monoclonal antibodies effectively inhibited the progression of colorectal tumors in this mouse model. Collectively, these data suggest that TSLP controls the progression of colorectal cancer through regulation of tumor-specific T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; function and represents a potential therapeutic target that requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05226-7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PHGDH heterogeneity potentiates cancer cell dissemination and metastasis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer metastasis requires the transient activation of cellular programs enabling dissemination and seeding in distant organs. Genetic, transcriptional and translational heterogeneity contributes to this dynamic process. Metabolic heterogeneity has also been observed, yet its role in cancer progression is less explored. Here we find that the loss of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) potentiates metastatic dissemination. Specifically, we find that heterogeneous or low PHGDH expression in primary tumours of patients with breast cancer is associated with decreased metastasis-free survival time. In mice, circulating tumour cells and early metastatic lesions are enriched with Phgdh&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; cancer cells, and silencing Phgdh in primary tumours increases metastasis formation. Mechanistically, Phgdh interacts with the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase, and the loss of this interaction activates the hexosamine-sialic acid pathway, which provides precursors for protein glycosylation. As a consequence, aberrant protein glycosylation occurs, including increased sialylation of integrin α&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which potentiates cell migration and invasion. Inhibition of sialylation counteracts the metastatic ability of Phgdh&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; cancer cells. In conclusion, although the catalytic activity of PHGDH supports cancer cell proliferation, low PHGDH protein expression non-catalytically potentiates cancer dissemination and metastasis formation. Thus, the presence of PHDGH heterogeneity in primary tumours could be considered a sign of tumour aggressiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD4&#43; T-cell epitope-based heterologous prime-boost vaccination potentiates anti-tumor immunity and PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35580929/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Antitumor therapeutic vaccines are generally based on antigenic epitopes presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) molecules to induce tumor-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Paradoxically, continuous T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation from tumor-derived CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell epitopes can drive the functional exhaustion of tumor-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Tumor-specific type-I helper CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1) cells play an important role in the population maintenance and cytotoxic function of exhausted tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Nonetheless, whether the vaccination strategy targeting MHC-II-restricted CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell epitopes to induce tumor-specific TH1 responses can confer effective antitumor immunity to restrain tumor growth is not well studied. Here, we developed a heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy to effectively induce tumor-specific T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 cells and evaluated its antitumor efficacy and its capacity to potentiate PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/em&gt; vector and influenza A virus (PR8 strain) vector stably expressing lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) glycoprotein-specific I-A&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;-restricted CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell epitope (GP&lt;sub&gt;61-80&lt;/sub&gt;) or ovalbumin-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell epitope (OVA&lt;sub&gt;323-339&lt;/sub&gt;) were constructed and evaluated their efficacy against mouse models of melanoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma expressing lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein and ovalbumin. The impact of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell epitope-based heterologous prime-boost vaccination was detected by flow-cytometer, single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell TCR sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell epitope-based heterologous prime-boost vaccination efficiently suppressed both mouse melanoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma. This vaccination primarily induced tumor-specific TH1 response, which in turn enhanced the expansion, effector function and clonal breadth of tumor-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Furthermore, this vaccination strategy synergized PD-L1 blockade mediated tumor suppression. Notably, prime-boost vaccination extended the duration of PD-L1 blockade induced antitumor effects by preventing the re-exhaustion of tumor-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell epitope-based heterologous prime-boost vaccination elicited potent both tumor-specific T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 and CTL response, leading to the efficient tumor control. This strategy can also potentiate PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting SNORA38B attenuates tumorigenesis and sensitizes immune checkpoint blockade in non-small cell lung cancer by remodeling the tumor microenvironment via regulation of GAB2/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35577506/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), are widely involved in the physiological and pathological processes of human beings. While up to date, although considerable progress has been achieved in ncRNA-related pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the underlying mechanisms and biological significance of snoRNAs in NSCLC still need to be further clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or RNAscope was performed to verify the expression of Small Nucleolar RNA, H/ACA Box 38B (SNORA38B) in NSCLC cell lines or clinical samples. BALB/c nude mice xenograft model or C57BL/6J mice syngeneic tumor model were estimated to detect the effects of SNORA38B in tumor growth or tumor immune microenvironment in vivo. Cytometry by time of flight, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry assay were conducted to clarify the effects and mechanisms of SNORA38B-mediated tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The binding activity between SNORA38B and E2F transcription factor 1(E2F1) was detected by RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays. Then, bioinformatics analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation were utilized to demonstrate the regulation of GRB2-associated-binding protein 2 (GAB2) by E2F1. Moreover, the combinatorial treatment of SNORA38B locked nucleic acid (LNA) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) was used to treat murine Lewis lung carcinoma-derived tumor burden C57BL/6J mice to clarify the effectiveness of targeting SNORA38B in NSCLC immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; SNORA38B was found highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and associated with worse prognosis. Further results showed that SNORA38B functioned as an oncogene via facilitating cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and inhibiting cell apoptosis in vitro and promoting tumorigenesis of NSCLC cells in vivo. SNORA38B could also recruit the CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells by triggering tumor cells to secrete interleukin 10, which in turn reduced the infiltration of CD3+CD8+ T cells in NSCLC tumor microenvironment (TME), favoring tumor progression and poorer immune efficacy. Mechanistically, SNORA38B mainly distributed in the nucleus, and promoted NSCLC progression by regulating GAB2 transcription to activate protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway through directly binding with E2F1. Moreover, we found that SNORA38B LNAs were able to ameliorate CD3+CD8+ T cell infiltration in TME, which sensitized NSCLC to the treatment of ICB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In conclusion, our data demonstrated that SNORA38B functioned as an oncogene in NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo at least in part by regulating the GAB2/AKT/mTOR pathway via directly binding to E2F1. SNORA38B could also sensitize NSCLC to immunotherapy, which may be a critical therapeutic target for NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genomic landscape of chemical-induced lung tumors under Nrf2 different expression levels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35561328/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transcription factor Nrf2 plays a crucial role in the anti-oxidative stress response, protection of DNA from injury and DNA repair mechanisms. Nrf2 activity reduces cancer initiation, but how Nrf2 affects whole-genome alterations upon carcinogenic stimulus remains unexplored. Although recent genome-wide analysis using next-generation sequencing revealed landscapes of nucleotide mutations and copy number alterations in various human cancers, genomic changes in murine cancer models have not been thoroughly examined. We elucidated the relationship between Nrf2 expression levels and whole exon mutation patterns using an ethyl-carbamate (urethane)-induced lung carcinogenesis model employing &lt;em&gt;Nrf2&lt;/em&gt;-deficient and &lt;em&gt;Keap1&lt;/em&gt;-kd mice, the latter of which express high levels of &lt;em&gt;Nrf2&lt;/em&gt;. Exome analysis demonstrated that single nucleotide and trinucleotide mutation patterns and the Kras mutational signature differed significantly and were dependent on the expression level of &lt;em&gt;Nrf2&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Nrf2&lt;/em&gt;-deficient tumors exhibited fewer copy number alterations relative to the &lt;em&gt;Nrf2&lt;/em&gt;-wt and &lt;em&gt;Keap1&lt;/em&gt;-kd tumors. The observed trend in genomic alterations likely prevented the &lt;em&gt;Nrf2&lt;/em&gt;-deficient tumors from progressing into malignancy. For the first time, we present whole-exome sequencing results for chemically-induced lung tumors in the &lt;em&gt;Nrf2&lt;/em&gt; gain or loss of function mouse models. Our results demonstrate that different &lt;em&gt;Nrf2&lt;/em&gt; expression levels lead to distinct gene mutation patterns that underly different oncogenic mechanisms in each tumor genotype.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor-Derived Lactate Creates a Favorable Niche for Tumor via Supplying Energy Source for Tumor and Modulating the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35646923/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor evolution is influenced by events involving tumor cells and the environment in which they live, known as the tumor microenvironment (TME). TME is a functional and structural niche composed of tumor cells, endothelial cells (ECs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), and a subset of immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, T cells, B cells). Otto Warburg revealed the Warburg effect in 1923, a characteristic metabolic mechanism of tumor cells that performs high glucose uptake and excessive lactate formation even in abundant oxygen. Tumor tissues excrete a large amount of lactate into the extracellular microenvironment in response to TME&amp;rsquo;s hypoxic or semi-hypoxic state. High lactate concentrations in tumor biopsies have been linked to metastasis and poor clinical outcome. This indicates that the metabolite may play a role in carcinogenesis and lead to immune escape in TME. Lactate is now recognized as an essential carbon source for cellular metabolism and as a signaling molecule in TME, forming an active niche that influences tumor progression. This review summarized the advanced literature demonstrating the functional role of lactate in TME remodeling, elucidating how lactate shapes the behavior and the phenotype of both tumor cells and tumor-associated cells. We also concluded the intriguing interactions of multiple immune cells in TME. Additionally, we demonstrated how lactate functioned as a novel function factor by being used in a new histone modification, histone lysine lactylation, and to regulate gene expression in TME. Ultimately, because lactate created a favorable niche for tumor progression, we summarized potential anti-tumor strategies targeting lactate metabolism and signaling to investigate better cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analysis of PANoptosis-Related LncRNA-miRNA-mRNA Network Reveals LncRNA SNHG7 Involved in Chemo-Resistance in Colon Adenocarcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35646635/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is one of the most common malignancies, and its metastatic lesions are the leading cause of death in COAD patients. PANoptosis is a recently identified pathway for programmed cell death implicated in developing COAD. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of cancer occurrence and progress. Although their function has captured much attention in COAD, the relationship between COAD metastasis-associated lncRNA expression and PANoptosis remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the potential regulatory roles of metastasis- and PANoptosis-associated lncRNAs in COAD. Nine lncRNAs associated with metastasis and PANoptosis in COAD were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GEO databases. Their functions were analyzed by multiple bioinformatics methods, and the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed. Multivariate Cox analysis identified one lncRNA (SNHG7) significantly related to COAD prognosis. Subsequent analyses showed its expression correlated with tumor stage and lymph node metastasis. Moreover, drug sensitivity analysis and in vitro experiments suggest that lncRNA SNHG7 contributes to drug resistance in COAD. In summary, lncRNA SNHG7 is a potential target for diagnosing and treating COAD and plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis, metastasis, and drug resistance in COAD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA CRART16/miR-122-5p/FOS axis promotes angiogenesis of gastric cancer by upregulating VEGFD expression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35537818/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; We previously identified a novel lncRNA, CRART16, that could induce cetuximab resistance in colorectal cancer cells. This study explored the relationship of CRART16 expression to gastric cancer progression and the molecular mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We evaluated CRART16 expression in gastric cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from the TCGA database and our hospital. Besides, we assessed its relationship with the overall survival (OS) of patients with gastric cancer. The effects of CRART16 on gastric cancer angiogenesis were determined by endothelial tube formation assay, spheroid sprouting assay, HUVEC invasion assay, and chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The involvement of the lncRNA CRART16/miR-122-5p/FOS axis was analyzed by western blotting and dual-luciferase reporter assay. The functions of CRART16 were confirmed in xenograft mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that CRART16 was substantially overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues compared with normal tissues, based on the TCGA database and our clinical samples. High expression of CRART16 correlated with more advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. Overexpression of CRART16 in gastric cancer cells promoted proliferation, colony formation, angiogenesis, and bevacizumab resistance in vitro, and it promoted tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo, and vice versa. CRART16 was found to downregulate miR-122-5p by acting as a sponge, upregulating the target oncogene FOS. Afterward, the increased FOS expression led to the upregulation of VEGFD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings demonstrate that CRART16 promotes angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and CRART16 is a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in gastric cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulation of Carcinogenesis by Sensory Neurons and Neuromediators</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35565462/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system are crucial in maintaining homeostasis, and disturbances of these neuro-immune interactions may participate in carcinogenesis and metastasis. Nerve endings have been identified within solid tumors in humans and experimental animals. Although the involvement of the efferent sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation in carcinogenesis has been extensively investigated, the role of the afferent sensory neurons and the neuropeptides in tumor development, growth, and progression is recently appreciated. Similarly, current findings point to the significant role of Schwann cells as part of neuro-immune interactions. Hence, in this review, we mainly focus on local and systemic effects of sensory nerve activity as well as Schwann cells in carcinogenesis and metastasis. Specific denervation of vagal sensory nerve fibers, or vagotomy, in animal models, has been reported to markedly increase lung metastases of breast carcinoma as well as pancreatic and gastric tumor growth, with the formation of liver metastases demonstrating the protective role of vagal sensory fibers against cancer. Clinical studies have revealed that patients with gastric ulcers who have undergone a vagotomy have a greater risk of stomach, colorectal, biliary tract, and lung cancers. Protective effects of vagal activity have also been documented by epidemiological studies demonstrating that high vagal activity predicts longer survival rates in patients with colon, non-small cell lung, prostate, and breast cancers. However, several studies have reported that inhibition of sensory neuronal activity reduces the development of solid tumors, including prostate, gastric, pancreatic, head and neck, cervical, ovarian, and skin cancers. These contradictory findings are likely to be due to the post-nerve injury-induced activation of systemic sensory fibers, the level of aggressiveness of the tumor model used, and the local heterogeneity of sensory fibers. As the aggressiveness of the tumor model and the level of the inflammatory response increase, the protective role of sensory nerve fibers is apparent and might be mostly due to systemic alterations in the neuro-immune response. Hence, more insights into inductive and permissive mechanisms, such as systemic, cellular neuro-immunological mechanisms of carcinogenesis and metastasis formation, are needed to understand the role of sensory neurons in tumor growth and spread.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel tRNA-derived fragment AS-tDR-007333 promotes the malignancy of NSCLC via the HSPB1/MED29 and ELK4/MED29 axes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35526007/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are a new class of small non-coding RNAs. Recent studies suggest that tRFs participate in some pathological processes. However, the biological functions and mechanisms of tRFs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Differentially expressed tRFs were identified by tRF and tiRNA sequencing using 9 pairs of pre- and post-operation plasma from patients with NSCLC. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to determine the levels of tRF in tissues, plasma, and cells. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were implemented to investigate the oncogenic effects of tRF on NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), luciferase reporter, RNA pulldown, mass spectrum, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays, and rescue experiments were performed to explore the regulatory mechanisms of tRF in NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; AS-tDR-007333 was an uncharacterized tRF and significantly up-regulated in NSCLC tissues, plasma, and cells. Clinically, AS-tDR-007333 overexpression could distinguish NSCLC patients from healthy controls and associated with poorer prognosis of NSCLC patients. Functionally, overexpression of AS-tDR-007333 enhanced proliferation and migration of NSCLC cells, whereas knockdown of AS-tDR-007333 resulted in opposite effects. Mechanistically, AS-tDR-007333 promoted the malignancy of NSCLC cells by activating MED29 through two distinct mechanisms. First, AS-tDR-007333 bound to and interacted with HSPB1, which activated MED29 expression by enhancing H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in MED29 promoter. Second, AS-tDR-007333 stimulated the expression of transcription factor ELK4, which bound to MED29 promoter and increased its transcription. Therapeutically, inhibition of AS-tDR-007333 suppressed NSCLC cell growth in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study identifies a new oncogenic tRF and uncovers a novel mechanism that AS-tDR-007333 promotes NSCLC malignancy through the HSPB1-MED29 and ELK4-MED29 axes. AS-tDR-007333 is a potential diagnostic or prognostic marker and therapeutic target for NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A widely expressed free immunoglobulin κ chain with a unique Vκ4-1/Jκ3 pattern promotes colon cancer invasion and metastasis by activating the integrin β1/FAK pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35533952/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The immunoglobulin κ chain with a unique Vκ4-1/Jκ3 pattern is widely expressed in cancer cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vκ4-1/Jκ3-Igκ is a hydrophobic FLC potentially located in the ECM and promotes cancer progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC interacts with integrin β1 and promotes cancer cells growth and migration via activating the FAK signaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC might be a novel therapeutic target in many cancers, such as colon cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, immunoglobulin (Ig) has been known as an antibody and is expressed only in B lineage cells; importantly, Ig light chains are conjugated to heavy chains to form intact Igs. However, in this study, we found a free Igκ light chain with a unique Vκ4-1/Jκ3 rearrangement (Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC) that was widely expressed in different non-B lineages and was overexpressed in cancer cells. Further study indicated that Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC was hydrophobic, formed obvious insoluble deposits in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and existed in free form. Functional analyses demonstrated that Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC promoted the proliferation, migration and metastasis of colon cancer cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Mechanistically, Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC bound to integrin β1 and activated the FAK and Src pathways. More importantly, specific antibodies against the variable region of Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC significantly inhibited the growth of colon cancer tumors. Our findings suggested that Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC is a novel ECM protein and integrin β1 ligand and that it is involved in cancer progression and is a potential therapeutic target in cancer, particularly colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA-PACERR induces pro-tumour macrophages via interacting with miR-671-3p and m6A-reader IGF2BP2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35526050/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; LncRNA-PACERR plays critical role in the polarization of tissue-associated macrophages (TAMs). In this study, we found the function and molecular mechanism of PACERR in TAMs to regulate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used qPCR to analyse the expression of PACERR in TAMs and M1-tissue-resident macrophages (M1-NTRMs) which were isolated from 46 PDAC tissues. The function of PACERR on macrophages polarization and PDAC proliferation, migration and invasion were confirmed through in vivo and in vitro assays. The molecular mechanism of PACERR was discussed via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RNA pull-down, ChIP-qPCR, RIP-qPCR and luciferase assays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; LncRNA-PACERR was high expression in TAMs and associated with poor prognosis in PDAC patients. Our finding validated that LncRNA-PACERR increased the number of M2-polarized cells and facilized cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LncRNA-PACERR activate KLF12/p-AKT/c-myc pathway by binding to miR-671-3p. And LncRNA-PACERR which bound to IGF2BP2 acts as an m6A-dependent manner to enhance the stability of KLF12 and c-myc in cytoplasm. In addition, the promoter of LncRNA-PACERR was a target of KLF12 and LncRNA-PACERR recruited EP300 to increase the acetylation of histone by interacting with KLF12 in nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study found that LncRNA-PACERR functions as key regulator of TAMs in PDAC microenvironment and revealed the novel mechanisms in cytoplasm and in nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KLF16 enhances stress tolerance of colorectal carcinomas by modulating nucleolar homeostasis and translational reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35524408/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translational reprogramming is part of the unfolded protein response (UPR) during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which acts to the advantage of cancer growth and development in different stress conditions, but the mechanism of ER stress-related translational reprogramming in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) progression remains unclear. Here, we identified that Krüppel-like factor 16 (KLF16) can promote CRC progression and stress tolerance through translational reprogramming. The expression of KLF16 was upregulated in CRC tissues and associated with poor prognosis for CRC patients. We found that ER stress inducers can recruit KLF16 to the nucleolus and increase its interaction with two essential proteins for nucleolar homeostasis: nucleophosmin1 (NPM1) and fibrillarin (FBL). Moreover, knockdown of KLF16 can dysregulate nucleolar homeostasis in CRC cells. Translation-reporter system and polysome profiling assays further showed that KLF16 can effectively promote cap-independent translation of ATF4, which can enhance ER-phagy and the proliferation of CRC cells. Overall, our study unveils a previously unrecognized role for KLF16 as an ER stress regulator through mediating translational reprogramming to enhance the stress tolerance of CRC cells and provides a potential therapeutic vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selective Targeting of Cancer Cells by Copper Ionophores: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35309510/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional cancer therapies suffer from severe off-target effects because most of them target critical facets of cells that are generally shared by all rapidly proliferating cells. The development of new therapeutic agents should aim to increase selectivity and therefore reduce side effects. In addition, these agents should overcome cancer cell resistance and target cancer stem cells. Some copper ionophores have shown promise in this direction thanks to an intrinsic selectivity in preferentially inducing cuproptosis of cancer cells compared to normal cells. Here, Cu ionophores are discussed with a focus on selectivity towards cancer cells and on the mechanisms responsible for this selectivity. The proposed strategies, to further improve the targeting of cancer cells by copper ionophores, are also reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Clinical-biopsy-derived MOSs enable rapid drug testing in 14 days&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have been shown to model clinical response to cancer therapy. However, it remains challenging to use these models to guide timely clinical decisions for cancer patients. Here, we used droplet emulsion microfluidics with temperature control and dead-volume minimization to rapidly generate thousands of micro-organospheres (MOSs) from low-volume patient tissues, which serve as an ideal patient-derived model for clinical precision oncology. A clinical study of recently diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients using an MOS-based precision oncology pipeline reliably assessed tumor drug response within 14 days, a timeline suitable for guiding treatment decisions in the clinic. Furthermore, MOSs capture original stromal cells and allow T cell penetration, providing a clinical assay for testing immuno-oncology (IO) therapies such as PD-1 blockade, bispecific antibodies, and T cell therapies on patient tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long noncoding RNA LINC01606 protects colon cancer cells from ferroptotic cell death and promotes stemness by SCD1-Wnt/β-catenin-TFE3 feedback loop signalling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35485210/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35485210/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ferroptosis is principally caused by iron catalytic activity and intracellular lipid peroxidation. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in tumorigenesis. However, the potential interplay between lncRNA LINC01606 and ferroptosis in colon cancer remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The expression level of LNC01606 in colon cancer tissue was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The functional role of LNC01606 was investigated by gain- and loss-of-function assays both in vitro and in vivo. The LINC01606-SCD1-Wnt/β-catenin-TFE3 axis were screened and validated by DNA/RNA pull down, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The expression of lncRNA LINC01606 was frequently upregulated in human colon cancer and strongly associated with a poor prognosis. LINC01606 functioned as an oncogene and promotes colon cancer cell growth, invasion and stemness both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, LINC01606 protected colon cancer cells from ferroptosis by decreasing the concentration of iron, lipid reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial superoxide and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential. Mechanistically, LINC01606 enhanced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), serving as a competing endogenous RNA to modulate miR-423-5p expression, subsequently activating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3 (TFE3) increased LINC01606 transcription after recruitment to the promoter regions of LINC01606. Furthermore, we confirmed that upregulated LINC01606 and Wnt/β-catenin formed a positive feedback regulatory loop, further inhibiting ferroptosis and enhancing stemness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; LINC01606 functions as an oncogene to facilitate tumor cell stemness, proliferation and inhibit ferroptosis and is a promising therapeutic target for colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long noncoding RNA TLNC1 promotes the growth and metastasis of liver cancer via inhibition of p53 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35477447/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to play vital roles in cancer development and progression. However, their biological roles and function mechanisms in liver cancer remain largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; RNA-seq was performed with clinical hepatoma tissues and paired adjacent normal liver tissues to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs. qPCR was utilized to examine the expression levels of lncRNAs. We studied the function of TLNC1 in cell growth and metastasis of hepatoma with both cell and mouse models. RNA-seq, RNA pull-down coupled with mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation, dual luciferase reporter assay, and surface plasmon resonance analysis were used to analyze the functional mechanism of TLNC1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Based on the intersection of our own RNA-seq, TCGA RNA-seq, and TCGA survival analysis data, TLNC1 was identified as a potential tumorigenic lncRNA of liver cancer. TLNC1 significantly enhanced the growth and metastasis of hepatoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. TLNC1 exerted its tumorigenic function through interaction with TPR and inducing the TPR-mediated transportation of p53 from nucleus to cytoplasm, thus repressing the transcription of p53 target genes and finally contributing to the progression of liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; TLNC1 is a promising prognostic factor of liver cancer, and the TLNC1-TPR-p53 axis can serve as a potential therapeutic target for hepatoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Renal Function Outcomes in Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma Patients Treated with Chemotherapy or Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: An Unexpected Scenario</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35632435/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and platinum-based chemotherapy (CT) are effective therapeutic agents for the palliative treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); the aim of our study was to investigate the acute and chronic renal toxicities in this setting. We collected data on 292 patients who received cisplatin (35%), carboplatin-based regimens (25%), or ICI monotherapy (40%). The primary and secondary outcomes were compared to the acute kidney injury (AKI) rate and the mean estimated GFR (eGFR) decay between groups, respectively, over a mean follow-up duration of 15 weeks. We observed 26 AKI events (8.9%), mostly stage I AKI (80.7%); 15% were stage II AKI, 3.8% were stage III, and none required renal replacement therapy or ICU admission. The AKI rates were 10.9%, 6.8%, and 8.9% for the cisplatin, carboplatin, and ICI groups, respectively, and no significant differences were observed between the groups (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.3). A global mean eGFR decay of 2.2 mL/min was observed, while for the cisplatin, carboplatin, and ICI groups, the eGFR decay values were 2.3 mL/min, 1.1 mL/min, and 3.5 mL/min, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the groups. Cisplatin/carboplatin-based CT and ICIs resulted in a similar incidence of AKI and eGFR decay, suggesting the safety of their cautious use, even in CKD patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNA circ-MTHFD1L induces HR repair to promote gemcitabine resistance via the miR-615-3p/RPN6 axis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35459186/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer is the main reason for the poor treatment effect of pancreatic cancer patients. Exploring chemotherapy resistance-related genes has been a difficult and hot topic of oncology. Numerous studies implicate the key roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the development of pancreatic cancer. However, the regulation of circRNAs in the process of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) chemotherapy resistance is not yet fully clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Based on the cross-analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the data of our center, we explored a new molecule, hsa_circ_0078297 (circ-MTHFD1L), related to chemotherapy resistance. QRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in human PDAC tissues and their matched normal tissues. The interaction between circ-MTHFD1L and miR-615-3p/RPN6 signal axis was confirmed by a series of experiments such as Dual-luciferase reporter assay, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Circ-MTHFD1L was significantly increased in PDAC tissues and cells. And in PDAC patients, the higher the expression level of circ-MTHFD1L, the worse the prognosis. Mechanism analysis showed that circ-MTHFD1L, as an endogenous miR-615-3p sponge, upregulates the expression of RPN6, thereby promoting DNA damage repair and exerting its effect on enhancing gemcitabine chemotherapy resistance. More importantly, we also found that Silencing circ-MTHFD1L combined with olaparib can increase the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Circ-MTHFD1L maintains PDAC gemcitabine resistance through the miR-615-3p/RPN6 signal axis. Circ-MTHFD1L may be a molecular marker for the effective treatment of PDAC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KMT2C deficiency promotes small cell lung cancer metastasis through DNMT3A-mediated epigenetic reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35449309/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is notorious for its early and frequent metastases, which contribute to it as a recalcitrant malignancy. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying SCLC metastasis, we generated SCLC mouse models with orthotopically transplanted genome-edited lung organoids and performed multiomics analyses. We found that a deficiency of KMT2C, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase frequently mutated in extensive-stage SCLC, promoted multiple-organ metastases in mice. Metastatic and KMT2C-deficient SCLC displayed both histone and DNA hypomethylation. Mechanistically, KMT2C directly regulated the expression of DNMT3A, a de novo DNA methyltransferase, through histone methylation. Forced DNMT3A expression restrained metastasis of KMT2C-deficient SCLC through repressing metastasis-promoting MEIS/HOX genes. Further, S-(5′-adenosyl)-L-methionine, the common cofactor of histone and DNA methyltransferases, inhibited SCLC metastasis. Thus, our study revealed a concerted epigenetic reprogramming of KMT2C- and DNMT3A-mediated histone and DNA hypomethylation underlying SCLC metastasis, which suggested a potential epigenetic therapeutic vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crosstalk between lncRNAs in the apoptotic pathway and therapeutic targets in cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35597701/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assertion that a significant portion of the mammalian genome has not been translated and that non-coding RNA accounts for over half of polyadenylate RNA have received much attention. In recent years, increasing evidence proposes non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) as new regulators of various cellular processes, including cancer progression and nerve damage. Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death critical for homeostasis and tissue development. Cancer cells often have inhibited apoptotic pathways. It has recently been demonstrated that up/down-regulation of various lncRNAs in certain types of tumors shapes cancer cells&amp;rsquo; response to apoptotic stimuli. This review discusses the most recent studies on lncRNAs and apoptosis in healthy and cancer cells. In addition, the role of lncRNAs as novel targets for cancer therapy is reviewed here. Finally, since it has been shown that lncRNA expression is associated with specific types of cancer, the potential for using lncRNAs as biomarkers is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The pseudogenes of eukaryotic translation elongation factors (EEFs): Role in cancer and other human diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eukaryotic translation elongation factors (EEFs), i.e. &lt;em&gt;EEF1A1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EEF1A2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EEF1B2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EEF1D&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EEF1G&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EEF1E1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;EEF2&lt;/em&gt;, are coding-genes that play a central role in the elongation step of translation but are often altered in cancer. Less investigated are their pseudogenes. Recently, it was demonstrated that pseudogenes have a key regulatory role in the cell, especially via non-coding RNAs, and that the aberrant expression of ncRNAs has an important role in cancer development and progression. The present review paper, for the first time, collects all that published about the EEFs pseudogenes to create a base for future investigations. For most of them, the studies are in their infancy, while for others the studies suggest their involvement in normal cell physiology but also in various human diseases. However, more investigations are needed to understand their functions in both normal and cancer cells and to define which can be useful biomarkers or therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inflammatory response is tightly regulated, but its regulatory principles are still incompletely understood. Cyclophilin A (CypA) has long been considered as a pro-inflammatory factor. Here, we discover how CypA precisely regulates interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-mediated inflammatory responses. In lipopolysaccharide-treated mice, CypA deficiency initially inhibits and then promotes lung inflammation, which is closely related to IL-1β production. Mechanistically, CypA not only facilitates pro-IL-1β processing by increasing Smurf1-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination in an ATP-dependent manner but also accelerates pro-IL-1β degradation, depending on Smurf1-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination. Moreover, in IL-1β-treated mice, CypA exacerbates lung injury by enhancing cytokine production. It also upregulates the ILK/AKT pathway by inhibiting Cyld-mediated K63-linked ILK deubiquitination, which promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to facilitate lung repair. Collectively, CypA promotes inflammation activation by increasing IL-1β production and then promotes inflammation resolution by enhancing redundant pro-IL-1β degradation and IL-1β-induced EMT, indicating the complex and delicate regulation of inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Promoter and enhancer RNAs regulate chromatin reorganization and activation of miR-10b/HOXD locus, and neoplastic transformation in glioma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35390275/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chromatin topology of the HOXD locus is altered between the brain and glioblastoma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lncRNAs regulate CTCF/cohesin-dependent loop formation and HOXD gene expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of LINC01116 enhancer RNA leads to astrocyte transformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transformation depends on the loop formation and miR-10b derepression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;miR-10b is silenced in normal neuroglial cells of the brain but commonly activated in glioma, where it assumes an essential tumor-promoting role. We demonstrate that the entire miR-10b-hosting HOXD locus is activated in glioma via the cis-acting mechanism involving 3D chromatin reorganization and CTCF-cohesin-mediated looping. This mechanism requires two interacting lncRNAs, HOXD-AS2 and LINC01116, one associated with HOXD3/HOXD4/miR-10b promoter and another with the remote enhancer. Knockdown of either lncRNA in glioma cells alters CTCF and cohesin binding, abolishes chromatin looping, inhibits the expression of all genes within HOXD locus, and leads to glioma cell death. Conversely, in cortical astrocytes, enhancer activation is sufficient for HOXD/miR-10b locus reorganization, gene derepression, and neoplastic cell transformation. LINC01116 RNA is essential for this process. Our results demonstrate the interplay of two lncRNAs in the chromatin folding and concordant regulation of miR-10b and multiple HOXD genes normally silenced in astrocytes and triggering the neoplastic glial transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common malignancies with limited treatments other than surgery. The tumor microenvironment (TME) profiling enables the discovery of potential therapeutic targets. Here, we profile 54,103 cells from tumor and adjacent tissues to characterize cellular composition and elucidate the potential origin and regulation of tumor-enriched cell types in CRC. We demonstrate that the tumor-specific FAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts and SPP1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages were positively correlated in 14 independent CRC cohorts containing 2550 samples and validate their close localization by immuno-fluorescent staining and spatial transcriptomics. This interaction might be regulated by chemerin, TGF-β, and interleukin-1, which would stimulate the formation of immune-excluded desmoplasic structure and limit the T cell infiltration. Furthermore, we find patients with high FAP or SPP1 expression achieved less therapeutic benefit from an anti-PD-L1 therapy cohort. Our results provide a potential therapeutic strategy by disrupting FAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts and SPP1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages interaction to improve immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypoxia-induced circWSB1 promotes breast cancer progression through destabilizing p53 by interacting with USP10</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35351136/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Hypoxia has long been considered as a hallmark of solid tumors and is closely associated with tumor progression. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified as a critical modulator in various cancers. However, the connections between hypoxia and circRNAs are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Here, we investigated the expression profile of circRNAs in breast cancer (BC) MCF-7 cells under hypoxia and normoxia using microarray. We identified a novel hypoxia-responsive circRNA named circWSB1, whose expression pattern, potential diagnostic value and prognostic significance were assessed by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Loss- and gain-of-function investigations in vivo and in vitro were performed to determine the biological functions of circWSB1. Mechanistically, chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual luciferase reporter assays were carried out to analyze the biogenesis of circWSB1. Furthermore, biotin-labeled RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation, fluorescent in situ hybridization, RNA electrophoretic mobility shift, deletion-mapping, co-immunoprecipitation assays and rescue experiments were applied to investigate the interaction between circWSB1 and Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) as well as the relationship between USP10 and p53.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that the expression of circWSB1 was significantly upregulated in BC tissues and correlated with poor clinical outcomes, which might serve as an independent prognostic factor for BC patients. Ectopic expression of circWSB1 promoted the proliferation of BC cell in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circWSB1 was transcriptionally upregulated by HIF1α in response to hypoxia and could competitively bind to deubiquitinase USP10 to prevent the access of p53 to USP10 in BC cells, leading to degradation of p53 and tumor progression of BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Taken together, our findings disclose a novel mechanism that hypoxia-inducible circWSB1 could interact with USP10 to attenuate USP10 mediated p53 stabilization and promote the progression of BC, providing an alternative prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for BC.&lt;/p&gt;

Here, we employed a counterintuitive approach of overexpressing Yamanaka factors (Oct4, c-Myc, Sox2, and Klf4) and examined a conditioned medium (CM)-based treatment option with induced tumor-suppressing cells (iTSCs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; proliferation and migration assays were conducted using tumor cell lines derived from breast cancer, as well as prostate and pancreatic cancers, and osteosarcoma. The tumor-suppressing capability of iTSC-derived CM was evaluated using freshly isolated breast cancer tissues and a mouse model of mammary tumors and tumor-induced osteolysis. The regulatory mechanism was evaluated using Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, pull-down, gene overexpression, and RNA interference based on mass spectrometry-based proteomics data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The overexpression of Oct4 and c-Myc in tumor cells and MSCs, but not Sox2 or Klf4, generated anti-tumor CM, which suppressed the progression of mammary tumors and tumor-induced bone loss. Notably, CM downregulated histone demethylase, and PDL-1, a blocker of T-cell-based immune responses. Whole-genome proteomics predicted enolase 1 (Eno1), Hsp90ab1, Eef2, and vinculin as extracellular tumor suppressors. Specifically, CD44 was co-immunoprecipitated with Eno1 and the silencing of CD44 suppressed Eno1&amp;rsquo;s anti-tumor action. The overexpression of Oct4 and c-Myc also generated secretomes that inhibited the development of bone-resorbing osteoclasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In analogous to cell competition in which Myc-overexpressing cells in Drosophila and mouse embryos remove neighboring cells with a lower level of Myc, this study presented the possibility of eliminating tumor cells by the secretory proteomes derived from Myc/Oc4-overexpressing iTSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PUMILIO proteins promote colorectal cancer growth via suppressing p21</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PUMILIO (PUM) proteins belong to the highly conserved PUF family post-transcriptional regulators involved in diverse biological processes. However, their function in carcinogenesis remains under-explored. Here, we report that Pum1 and Pum2 display increased expression in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Intestine-specific knockout of Pum1 and Pum2 in mice significantly inhibits the progression of colitis-associated cancer in the AOM/DSS model. Knockout or knockdown of Pum1 and/or Pum2 in human CRC cells result in a significant decrease in the tumorigenicity and delayed G1/S transition. We identify p21/Cdkn1a as a direct target of PUM1. Abrogation of the PUM1 binding site in the p21 mRNA also results in decreased cancer cell growth and delayed G1/S transition. Furthermore, intravenous injection of nanoparticle-encapsulated anti-Pum1 and Pum2 siRNAs reduces colorectal tumor growth in murine orthotopic colon cancer models. These findings reveal the requirement of PUM proteins for CRC progression and their potential as therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomal circLPAR1 functions in colorectal cancer diagnosis and tumorigenesis through suppressing BRD4 via METTL3-eIF3h interaction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35164758/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Exosomes have emerged as vital biomarkers of multiple cancers and contain abundant circular RNAs (circRNAs). However, the potential for exosomal circRNAs to be used in diagnostics and their molecular mechanism of action in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; CRC-specific exosomal circRNAs were identified by RNA sequencing, exoRBase database and a tissue microarray. The diagnostic performance of plasma exosomal circRNAs was evaluated among cancer-free controls, precancer individuals, CRC patients, and patients with other types of cancer. The corresponding biological functions were mainly assessed using circRNA pull-down, proteomic analysis, and RNA immunoprecipitation assay underlying cellular and mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CircLPAR1 was encapsulated in exosomes with high stability and detectability, and its expression in plasma exosomes was remarkably decreased during CRC development but recovered after surgery. Exosomal circLPAR1 showed cancer specificity in CRC diagnosis and increased the diagnostic performance to an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.875, as determined by analysing its performance in combination with common clinical biomarkers CEA and CA19-9. Additionally, circLPAR1 was downregulated in CRC tissues and was associated with overall survival. Mechanistically, exosomal circLPAR1 was internalized by CRC cells, and it suppressed tumor growth, likely because exosomal circLPAR1 directly bound with eIF3h specifically suppressed the METTL3-eIF3h interaction, decreasing the translation of oncogene BRD4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This comprehensive study highlights plasma exosomal circLPAR1 as a promising predictor in CRC diagnosis and describes its biological regulation of colorectal tumorigenesis. This study provides a new perspective on early diagnosis in the clinic and pathogenesis in disease development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>circVAMP3 Drives CAPRIN1 Phase Separation and Inhibits Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Suppressing c-Myc Translation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35072355/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have identified the regulatory roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in human cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. This study screens the expression profile of circRNAs in HCC and identifies circVAMP3 as a significantly downregulated circRNA in HCC tissues. HCC patients with low circVAMP3 expression present poor prognosis. circVAMP3 negatively regulates the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo by driving phase separation of CAPRIN1 and promoting stress granule formation in cells, which can downregulate the protein level of Myc proto-oncogene protein by inhibiting c-Myc translation. Furthermore, circVAMP3 is widely expressed in many human tissues and is downregulated in related cancers. Therefore, circVAMP3 is a potential prognostic indicator for HCC and may serve as a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genome-wide screens identify specific drivers of mutant hTERT promoters</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35027447/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in &lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; promoter are seen in over 19% of human cancers, irrespective of the cancer type. Understanding the molecular players that regulate Mut-&lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; promoters may help the design of effective targeting strategies to inhibit telomerase reactivation specifically in cancer cells. Our work uses genome-wide functional screens to identify 30 specific regulators of Mut-&lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; promoters. These candidates identified from the screening serve as an excellent resource to understand how telomerase is reactivated and as targets for making inhibitors to telomerase, a key driver of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer-specific &lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; promoter mutations reported in 19% of cancers result in enhanced telomerase activity. Understanding the distinctions between transcriptional regulation of wild-type (WT) and mutant (Mut) &lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; promoters may open up avenues for development of inhibitors which specially block &lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; expression in cancer cells. To comprehensively identify physiological regulators of WT- or Mut-&lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; promoters, we generated several isogenic reporter cells driven by endogenous &lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; loci. Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 and small interfering RNA screens using these isogenic reporter lines identified specific regulators of Mut-&lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; promoters. We validate and characterize one of these hits, namely, MED12, a kinase subunit of mediator complex. We demonstrate that MED12 specifically drives expression of &lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; from the Mut-&lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; promoter by mediating long-range chromatin interaction between the proximal Mut-&lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; promoter and &lt;em&gt;T-INT1&lt;/em&gt; distal regulatory region 260 kb upstream. Several hits identified in our screens could serve as potential therapeutic targets, inhibition of which may specifically block Mut-&lt;em&gt;hTERT&lt;/em&gt; promoter driven telomerase reactivation in cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A targetable LIFR-NF-κB-LCN2 axis controls liver tumorigenesis and vulnerability to ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34921145/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing knowledge of ferroptosis has suggested the role and therapeutic potential of ferroptosis in cancer, but has not been translated into effective therapy. Liver cancer, primarily hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is highly lethal with limited treatment options. LIFR is frequently downregulated in HCC. Here, by studying hepatocyte-specific and inducible Lifr-knockout mice, we show that loss of Lifr promotes liver tumorigenesis and confers resistance to drug-induced ferroptosis. Mechanistically, loss of LIFR activates NF-κB signaling through SHP1, leading to upregulation of the iron-sequestering cytokine LCN2, which depletes iron and renders insensitivity to ferroptosis inducers. Notably, an LCN2-neutralizing antibody enhances the ferroptosis-inducing and anticancer effects of sorafenib on HCC patient-derived xenograft tumors with low LIFR expression and high LCN2 expression. Thus, anti-LCN2 therapy is a promising way to improve liver cancer treatment by targeting ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting cancer metabolism in the era of precision oncology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred years have passed since Warburg discovered alterations in cancer metabolism, more than 70 years since Sidney Farber introduced anti-folates that transformed the treatment of childhood leukaemia, and 20 years since metabolism was linked to oncogenes. However, progress in targeting cancer metabolism therapeutically in the past decade has been limited. Only a few metabolism-based drugs for cancer have been successfully developed, some of which are in - or en route to - clinical trials. Strategies for targeting the intrinsic metabolism of cancer cells often did not account for the metabolism of non-cancer stromal and immune cells, which have pivotal roles in tumour progression and maintenance. By considering immune cell metabolism and the clinical manifestations of inborn errors of metabolism, it may be possible to isolate undesirable off-tumour, on-target effects of metabolic drugs during their development. Hence, the conceptual framework for drug design must consider the metabolic vulnerabilities of non-cancer cells in the tumour immune microenvironment, as well as those of cancer cells. In this Review, we cover the recent developments, notable milestones and setbacks in targeting cancer metabolism, and discuss the way forward for the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune system gene regulation perturbation has been found to be a major cause of the development of various types of cancer. Numbers of mechanisms contribute to gene expression regulation, thus, systematically identification of potential regulons of immune-related pathways is critical to cancer immunotherapy. Here, we comprehensively chart the landscape of transcription factors, microRNAs, RNA binding proteins and long noncoding RNAs regulation in 17 immune-related pathways across 33 cancers. The potential immunology regulons are likely to exhibit higher expressions in immune cells, show expression perturbations in cancer, and are significantly correlated with immune cell infiltrations. We also identify a panel of clinically relevant immunology regulons across cancers. Moreover, the regulon atlas of immune-related pathways helps prioritizing cancer-related genes (i.e. ETV7, miR-146a-5p, ZFP36 and HCP5). We further identified two molecular subtypes of glioma (cold and hot tumour phenotypes), which were characterized by differences in immune cell infiltrations, expression of checkpoints, and prognosis. Finally, we developed a user-friendly resource, &lt;a href=&#34;http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/ImmReg/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ImmReg&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple modules to visualize, browse, and download immunology regulation. Our study provides a comprehensive landscape of immunology regulons, which will shed light on future development of RNA-based cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RBMS1 regulates lung cancer ferroptosis through translational control of SLC7A11</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34609966/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent nonapoptotic cell death, is a highly regulated tumor suppressing process. However, functions and mechanisms of RNA-binding proteins in regulation of evasion of ferroptosis during lung cancer progression are still largely unknown. Here, we report that the RNA-binding protein RBMS1 participates in lung cancer development via mediating ferroptosis evasion. Through an shRNA-mediated systematic screen, we discovered that RBMS1 is a key ferroptosis regulator. Clinically, RBMS1 was elevated in lung cancer and its high expression was associated with reduced patient survival. Conversely, depletion of RBMS1 inhibited lung cancer progression both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, RBMS1 interacted with the translation initiation factor eIF3d directly to bridge the 3&amp;rsquo;- and 5&amp;rsquo;-UTR of SLC7A11. RBMS1 ablation inhibited the translation of SLC7A11, reduced SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake, and promoted ferroptosis. In a drug screen that targeted RBMS1, we further uncovered that nortriptyline hydrochloride decreased the level of RBMS1, thereby promoting ferroptosis. Importantly, RBMS1 depletion or inhibition by nortriptyline hydrochloride sensitized radioresistant lung cancer cells to radiotherapy. Our findings established RBMS1 as a translational regulator of ferroptosis and a prognostic factor with therapeutic potential and clinical value.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crosstalk between autophagy inhibitors and endosome-related secretory pathways: a challenge for autophagy-based treatment of solid cancers</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34706732/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is best known for its role in organelle and protein turnover, cell quality control, and metabolism. The autophagic machinery has, however, also adapted to enable protein trafficking and unconventional secretory pathways so that organelles (such as autophagosomes and multivesicular bodies) delivering cargo to lysosomes for degradation can change their mission from fusion with lysosomes to fusion with the plasma membrane, followed by secretion of the cargo from the cell. Some factors with key signalling functions do not enter the conventional secretory pathway but can be secreted in an autophagy-mediated manner.Positive clinical results of some autophagy inhibitors are encouraging. Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that autophagy inhibition, even within the same cancer type, can affect cancer progression differently. Even next-generation inhibitors of autophagy can have significant non-specific effects, such as impacts on endosome-related secretory pathways and secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Many studies suggest that cancer cells release higher amounts of EVs compared to non-malignant cells, which makes the effect of autophagy inhibitors on EVs secretion highly important and attractive for anticancer therapy. In this review article, we discuss how different inhibitors of autophagy may influence the secretion of EVs and summarize the non-specific effects of autophagy inhibitors with a focus on endosome-related secretory pathways. Modulation of autophagy significantly impacts not only the quantity of EVs but also their content, which can have a deep impact on the resulting pro-tumourigenic or anticancer effect of autophagy inhibitors used in the antineoplastic treatment of solid cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human microbiome constitutes a complex multikingdom community that symbiotically interacts with the host across multiple body sites. Host-microbiome interactions impact multiple physiological processes and a variety of multifactorial disease conditions. In the past decade, microbiome communities have been suggested to influence the development, progression, metastasis formation, and treatment response of multiple cancer types. While causal evidence of microbial impacts on cancer biology is only beginning to be unraveled, enhanced molecular understanding of such cancer-modulating interactions and impacts on cancer treatment are considered of major scientific importance and clinical relevance. In this review, we describe the molecular pathogenic mechanisms shared throughout microbial niches that contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. We highlight advances, limitations, challenges, and prospects in understanding how the microbiome may causally impact cancer and its treatment responsiveness, and how microorganisms or their secreted bioactive metabolites may be potentially harnessed and targeted as precision cancer therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatiotemporal Immune Landscape of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis at Single-Cell Level</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34417225/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver metastasis, the leading cause of colorectal cancer mortality, exhibits a highly heterogeneous and suppressive immune microenvironment. Here, we sequenced 97 matched samples by using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. Strikingly, the metastatic microenvironment underwent remarkable spatial reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells such as &lt;em&gt;MRC1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;CCL18&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; M2-like macrophages. We further developed scMetabolism, a computational pipeline for quantifying single-cell metabolism, and observed that those macrophages harbored enhanced metabolic activity. Interestingly, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could block this status and restore the antitumor immune balance in responsive patients, whereas the nonresponsive patients deteriorated into a more suppressive one. Our work described the immune evolution of metastasis and uncovered the black box of how tumors respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a single-cell and spatial atlas of colorectal liver metastasis and found the highly metabolically activated &lt;em&gt;MRC1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;CCL18&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; M2-like macrophages in metastatic sites. Efficient neoadjuvant chemotherapy can slow down such metabolic activation, raising the possibility to target metabolism pathways in metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Post-ingestion conversion of dietary indoles into anticancer agents</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are health benefits from consuming cruciferous vegetables that release indole-3-carbinol (I3C), but the in vivo transformation of I3C-related indoles remains underinvestigated. Here we detail the post-ingestion conversion of I3C into antitumor agents, 2-(indol-3-ylmethyl)-3,3&amp;rsquo;-diindolylmethane (LTr1) and 3,3&amp;rsquo;-diindolylmethane (DIM), by conceptualizing and materializing the reaction flux derailing (RFD) approach as a means of unraveling these stepwise transformations to be non-enzymatic but pH-dependent and gut microbe-sensitive. In the upper (or acidic) gastrointestinal tract, LTr1 is generated through Michael addition of 3-methyleneindolium (3MI, derived in situ from I3C) to DIM produced from I3C via the formaldehyde-releasing (major) and CO2-liberating (minor) pathways. In the large intestine, &amp;rsquo;endogenous&amp;rsquo; I3C and DIM can form, respectively, from couplings of formaldehyde with one and two molecules of indole (a tryptophan catabolite). Acid-producing gut bacteria such as Lactobacillus acidophilus facilitate the H+-promotable steps. This work updates our understanding of the merits of I3C consumption and identifies LTr1 as a drug candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A graph neural network model to estimate cell-wise metabolic flux using single-cell RNA-seq data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metabolic heterogeneity and metabolic interplay between cells are known as significant contributors to disease treatment resistance. However, with the lack of a mature high-throughput single-cell metabolomics technology, we are yet to establish systematic understanding of the intra-tissue metabolic heterogeneity and cooperative mechanisms. To mitigate this knowledge gap, we developed a novel computational method, namely, single-cell flux estimation analysis (scFEA), to infer the cell-wise fluxome from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scFEA is empowered by a systematically reconstructed human metabolic map as a factor graph, a novel probabilistic model to leverage the flux balance constraints on scRNA-seq data, and a novel graph neural network-based optimization solver. The intricate information cascade from transcriptome to metabolome was captured using multilayer neural networks to capitulate the nonlinear dependency between enzymatic gene expressions and reaction rates. We experimentally validated scFEA by generating an scRNA-seq data set with matched metabolomics data on cells of perturbed oxygen and genetic conditions. Application of scFEA on this data set showed the consistency between predicted flux and the observed variation of metabolite abundance in the matched metabolomics data. We also applied scFEA on five publicly available scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data sets and identified context- and cell group-specific metabolic variations. The cell-wise fluxome predicted by scFEA empowers a series of downstream analyses including identification of metabolic modules or cell groups that share common metabolic variations, sensitivity evaluation of enzymes with regards to their impact on the whole metabolic flux, and inference of cell-tissue and cell-cell metabolic communications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumour initiation and progression requires the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. Cancer cells autonomously alter their flux through various metabolic pathways in order to meet the increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic demand as well as mitigate oxidative stress required for cancer cell proliferation and survival. Cancer driver mutations coupled with environmental nutrient availability control flux through these metabolic pathways. Metabolites, when aberrantly accumulated, can also promote tumorigenesis. The development and application of new technologies over the last few decades has not only revealed the heterogeneity and plasticity of tumours but also allowed us to uncover new metabolic pathways involved in supporting tumour growth. The tumour microenvironment (TME), which can be depleted of certain nutrients, forces cancer cells to adapt by inducing nutrient scavenging mechanisms to sustain cancer cell proliferation. There is growing appreciation that the metabolism of cell types other than cancer cells within the TME, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts and immune cells, can modulate tumour progression. Because metastases are a major cause of death of patients with cancer, efforts are underway to understand how metabolism is harnessed by metastatic cells. Additionally, there is a new interest in exploiting cancer genetic analysis for patient stratification and/or dietary interventions in combination with therapies that target metabolism. In this Perspective, we highlight these main themes that are currently under investigation in the context of in vivo tumour metabolism, specifically emphasizing questions that remain unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circadian regulation of cancer cell and tumor microenvironment crosstalk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circadian rhythms regulate a remarkable variety of physiologic functions in living organisms. Circadian disruption is associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression through effects on cancer cell biological properties, including proliferation, DNA repair, apoptosis, metabolism, and stemness. Emerging evidence indicates that circadian clocks also play an influential role in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review outlines recent discoveries on how cancer cell clock components (including circadian clock and clock genes/proteins) regulate TME biology and, reciprocally, how TME clock components affect tumor growth, metastasis, and therapeutic response. An improved understanding of how clock components regulate the symbiosis between cancer cells and the TME will inform the development of novel clock-oriented therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HIPK2 phosphorylates HDAC3 for NF-κB acetylation to ameliorate colitis-associated colorectal carcinoma and sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34244427/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although inflammation is critical for the clearance of pathogens, uncontrolled inflammation also contributes to the development of multiple diseases such as cancer and sepsis. Since NF-κB-mediated transactivation in the nucleus is pivotal downstream of various stimuli to induce inflammation, searching the nuclear-localized targets specifically regulating NF-κB activation will provide important therapeutic application. Here, we have identified that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), a nuclear serine/threonine kinase, increases its expression in inflammatory macrophages. Importantly, HIPK2 deficiency or overexpression could enhance or inhibit inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated macrophages, respectively. HIPK2-deficient mice were more susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxemia and CLP-induced sepsis. Adoptive transfer of &lt;em&gt;Hipk2&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; bone marrow cells (BMs) also aggravated AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer. Mechanistically, HIPK2 bound and phosphorylated histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) at serine 374 to inhibit its enzymatic activity, thus reducing the deacetylation of p65 at lysine 218 to suppress NF-κB activation. Notably, the HDAC3 inhibitors protected wild-type or &lt;em&gt;Hipk2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; BMs-reconstituted mice from LPS-induced endotoxemia. Our findings suggest that the HIPK2-HDAC3-p65 module in macrophages restrains excessive inflammation, which may represent a new layer of therapeutic mechanism for colitis-associated colorectal cancer and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA-encoded microproteins: A new form of cargo in cell culture-derived and circulating extracellular vesicles</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34276900/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advancements in omics-based technologies over the past few years have led to the discovery of numerous biologically relevant peptides encoded by small open reading frames (smORFs) embedded in long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts (referred to as microproteins here) in a variety of species. However, the mechanisms and modes of action that underlie the roles of microproteins have yet to be fully characterized. Herein, we provide the first experimental evidence of abundant microproteins in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from glioma cancer cells, indicating that the EV-mediated transfer of microproteins may represent a novel mechanism for intercellular communication. Intriguingly, when examining human plasma, 48, 11 and 3 microproteins were identified from purified EVs, whole plasma and EV-free plasma, respectively, suggesting that circulating microproteins are primarily enriched in EVs. Most importantly, the preliminary data showed that the expression profile of EV microproteins in glioma patient diverged from the health donors, suggesting that the circulating microproteins in EVs might have potential diagnostic application in identifying patients with glioma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification and Characterization of Robust Hepatocellular Carcinoma Prognostic Subtypes Based on an Integrative Metabolite-Protein Interaction Network</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolite-protein interactions (MPIs) play key roles in cancer metabolism. However, our current knowledge about MPIs in cancers remains limited due to the complexity of cancer cells. Herein, the authors construct an integrative MPI network and propose a MPI network based hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subtyping and mechanism exploration workflow. Based on the expressions of hub proteins on the MPI network, two prognosis-distinctive HCC subtypes are identified. Meanwhile, multiple interdependent features of the poor prognostic subtype are observed, including hypoxia, DNA hypermethylation of metabolic pathways, fatty acid accumulation, immune pathway up-regulation, and exhausted T-cell infiltration. Notably, the immune pathway up-regulation is probably induced by accumulated unsaturated fatty acids which are predicted to interact with multiple immune regulators like SRC and TGFB1. Moreover, based on tumor microenvironment compositions, the poor prognostic subtype is further divided into two sub-populations showing remarkable differences in metabolism. The subtyping shows a strong consistency across multiple HCC cohorts including early-stage HCC. Overall, the authors redefine robust HCC prognosis subtypes and identify potential MPIs linking metabolism to immune regulations, thus promoting understanding and clinical applications about HCC metabolism heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interplay between EBV infection and acquired genetic alterations during nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) development remains vague. Here we report a comprehensive genomic analysis of 70 NPCs, combining whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of microdissected tumor cells with EBV oncogene expression to reveal multiple aspects of cellular-viral co-operation in tumorigenesis. Genomic aberrations along with EBV-encoded LMP1 expression underpin constitutive NF-κB activation in 90% of NPCs. A similar spectrum of somatic aberrations and viral gene expression undermine innate immunity in 79% of cases and adaptive immunity in 47% of cases; mechanisms by which NPC may evade immune surveillance despite its pro-inflammatory phenotype. Additionally, genomic changes impairing TGFBR2 promote oncogenesis and stabilize EBV infection in tumor cells. Fine-mapping of CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletion breakpoints reveals homozygous MTAP deletions in 32-34% of NPCs that confer marked sensitivity to MAT2A inhibition. Our work concludes that NPC is a homogeneously NF-κB-driven and immune-protected, yet potentially druggable, cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils are the most abundant myeloid cells in human blood and are emerging as important regulators of cancer. However, their functional importance has often been overlooked on the basis that they are short-lived, terminally differentiated and non-proliferative. Recent studies of their prominent roles in cancer have led to a paradigm shift in our appreciation of neutrophil functional diversity. This Review describes how neutrophil diversification, which in some contexts can lead to opposing functions, is generated within the tumour microenvironment as well as systemically. We compare neutrophil heterogeneity in cancer and in other pathophysiological contexts to provide an updated overview of our current knowledge of the functions of neutrophils in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transcription factor and oncoprotein MYC is a potent driver of many human cancers and can regulate numerous biological activities that contribute to tumorigenesis. How a single transcription factor can regulate such a diverse set of biological programmes is central to the understanding of MYC function in cancer. In this Perspective, we highlight how multiple proteins that interact with MYC enable MYC to regulate several central control points of gene transcription. These include promoter binding, epigenetic modifications, initiation, elongation and post-transcriptional processes. Evidence shows that a combination of multiple protein interactions enables MYC to function as a potent oncoprotein, working together in a &amp;lsquo;coalition model&amp;rsquo;, as presented here. Moreover, as MYC depends on its protein interactome for function, we discuss recent research that emphasizes an unprecedented opportunity to target protein interactors to directly impede MYC oncogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer greatly affects the quality of life of humans worldwide and the number of patients suffering from it is continuously increasing. Over the last century, numerous treatments have been developed to improve the survival of cancer patients but substantial progress still needs to be made before cancer can be truly cured. In recent years, antitumor immunity has become the most debated topic in cancer research and the booming development of immunotherapy has led to a new epoch in cancer therapy. In this review, we describe the relationships between tumors and the immune system, and the rise of immunotherapy. Then, we summarize the characteristics of tumor-associated immunity and immunotherapeutic strategies with various molecular mechanisms by showing the typical immune molecules whose antibodies are broadly used in the clinic and those that are still under investigation. We also discuss important elements from individual cells to the whole human body, including cellular mutations and modulation, metabolic reprogramming, the microbiome, and the immune contexture. In addition, we also present new observations and technical advancements of both diagnostic and therapeutic methods aimed at cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we discuss the controversies and challenges that negatively impact patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metformin induces Ferroptosis by inhibiting UFMylation of SLC7A11 in breast cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34162423/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34162423/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a newly defined form of regulated cell death characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxidation and is involved in various pathophysiological conditions, including cancer. Targeting ferroptosis is considered to be a novel anti-cancer strategy. The identification of FDA-approved drugs as ferroptosis inducers is proposed to be a new promising approach for cancer treatment. Despite a growing body of evidence indicating the potential efficacy of the anti-diabetic metformin as an anti-cancer agent, the exact mechanism underlying this efficacy has not yet been fully elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UFMylation of SLC7A11 is detected by immunoprecipitation and the expression of UFM1 and SLC7A11 in tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining. The level of ferroptosis is determined by the level of free iron, total/lipid Ros and GSH in the cells and the morphological changes of mitochondria are observed by transmission electron microscope. The mechanism in vivo was verified by in situ implantation tumor model in nude mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metformin induces ferroptosis in an AMPK-independent manner to suppress tumor growth. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that metformin increases the intracellular Fe2+ and lipid ROS levels. Specifically, metformin reduces the protein stability of SLC7A11, which is a critical ferroptosis regulator, by inhibiting its UFMylation process. Furthermore, metformin combined with sulfasalazine, the system xc− inhibitor, can work in a synergistic manner to induce ferroptosis and inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to demonstrate that the ability of metformin to induce ferroptosis may be a novel mechanism underlying its anti-cancer effect. In addition, we identified SLC7A11 as a new UFMylation substrate and found that targeting the UFM1/SLC7A11 pathway could be a promising cancer treatment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-6 regulates autophagy and chemotherapy resistance by promoting BECN1 phosphorylation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular cytokines are enriched in the tumor microenvironment and regulate various important properties of cancers, including autophagy. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the link between autophagy and extracellular cytokines remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that IL-6 activates autophagy through the IL-6/JAK2/BECN1 pathway and promotes chemotherapy resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC). Mechanistically, IL-6 triggers the interaction between JAK2 and BECN1, where JAK2 phosphorylates BECN1 at Y333. We demonstrate that BECN1 Y333 phosphorylation is crucial for BECN1 activation and IL-6-induced autophagy by regulating PI3KC3 complex formation. Furthermore, we investigate BECN1 Y333 phosphorylation as a predictive marker for poor CRC prognosis and chemotherapy resistance. Combination treatment with autophagy inhibitors or pharmacological agents targeting the IL-6/JAK2/BECN1 signaling pathway may represent a potential strategy for CRC cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gene-engineered exosomes-thermosensitive liposomes hybrid nanovesicles by the blockade of CD47 signal for combined photothermal therapy and cancer immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34147721/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD47, overexpressed on kinds of tumor cells, activates a &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t eat me&amp;rdquo; signal through binding to signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα), leading to immune escape from the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). It is also a huge challenge to deliver therapeutic drugs to the tumor sites due to the short retention time in blood, poor targeting of tumor cells and accelerated clearance by MPS. Herein, we designed a hybrid therapeutic nanovesicles, named as hGLV, by fusing gene-engineered exosomes with drug-loaded thermosensitive liposomes. We demonstrated that the CD47-overexpressed hGLV exhibited the long blood circulation and improved the macrophages-mediated the phagocytosis of tumor cells by blocking CD47 signal. Moreover, the resulted hGLV could remarkably target the homologous tumor in mice, achieving the preferential accumulation at the tumor sites. Importantly, hGLV loading the photothermal agent could achieve the excellent photothermal therapy (PTT) under laser irradiation after the intravenous injection, completely eliminating the tumors, leading to immunogenic cell death and generating substantial tumor-associated antigens, which could promote the maturation of immature dendritic cells with the help of the co-encapsulated immune adjuvant to trigger strong immune responses. Generally, the hybrid nanovesicles based on CD47 immune check point blockade can be a promising platform for the drug delivery in cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modeling Clinical Responses to Targeted Therapies by Patient-Derived Organoids of Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34083237/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34083237/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Patient-derived organoids (PDO) of lung cancer has been recently introduced, reflecting the genomic landscape of lung cancer. However, clinical relevance of advanced lung adenocarcinoma organoids remains unknown. Here, we examined the ability of PDOs to predict clinical responses to targeted therapies in individual patients and to identify effective anticancer therapies for novel molecular targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental design:&lt;/em&gt; Eighty-four organoids were established from patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from corresponding patients were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing (n = 12). Organoids were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing (n = 61) and RNA sequencing (n = 55). Responses to mono or combination targeted therapies were examined in organoids and organoid-derived xenografts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; PDOs largely retained somatic alterations including driver mutations of matching patient tumors. PDOs were able to recapitulate progression-free survival and objective responses of patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving clinically approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. PDOs recapitulated activity of therapeutic strategies under clinical investigation. YUO-071 harboring an &lt;em&gt;EGFR&lt;/em&gt; exon 19 deletion and a &lt;em&gt;BRAF&lt;/em&gt; G464A mutation and the matching patient responded to dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. YUO-004 and YUO-050 harboring an &lt;em&gt;EGFR&lt;/em&gt; L747P mutation was sensitive to afatinib, consistent with the response in the matching patient of YUO-050. Furthermore, we utilized organoids to identify effective therapies for novel molecular targets by demonstrating the efficacy of poziotinib against &lt;em&gt;ERBB2&lt;/em&gt; exon 20 insertions and pralsetinib against &lt;em&gt;RET&lt;/em&gt; fusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrated translational relevance of PDOs in advanced lung adenocarcinoma. PDOs are an important diagnostic tool, which can assist clinical decision making and accelerate development of therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The PP2A-Integrator-CDK9 axis fine-tunes transcription and can be targeted therapeutically in cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34004147/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene expression by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is tightly controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) at discrete checkpoints during the transcription cycle. The pausing checkpoint following transcription initiation is primarily controlled by CDK9. We discovered that CDK9-mediated, RNAPII-driven transcription is functionally opposed by a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex that is recruited to transcription sites by the Integrator complex subunit INTS6. PP2A dynamically antagonizes phosphorylation of key CDK9 substrates including DSIF and RNAPII-CTD. Loss of INTS6 results in resistance to tumor cell death mediated by CDK9 inhibition, decreased turnover of CDK9 phospho-substrates, and amplification of acute oncogenic transcriptional responses. Pharmacological PP2A activation synergizes with CDK9 inhibition to kill both leukemic and solid tumor cells, providing therapeutic benefit in vivo. These data demonstrate that fine control of gene expression relies on the balance between kinase and phosphatase activity throughout the transcription cycle, a process dysregulated in cancer that can be exploited therapeutically.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering of efficient and safe materials remains a challenge for cancer therapy. Here, the lipid droplet, an organelle in adipocytes, is demonstrated to be a controllable and biocompatible vehicle to deliver anticancer drugs. It is validated that isolated lipid droplets maintain their key physiological functions to interact with other organelles and augment the therapeutic effect of cancer photodynamic therapy by encapsulation with a lipid-conjugated photosensitizer (Pyrolipid) through a variety of pathways, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); lipid peroxidation; and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. As such, the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of Pyrolipid is reduced by 6.0-fold when loaded into the lipid droplet. Of note, in vivo results demonstrate that engineered lipid droplets induce significant inhibition of tumor growth with minimal side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer has myriad effects on metabolism that include both rewiring of intracellular metabolism to enable cancer cells to proliferate inappropriately and adapt to the tumor microenvironment, and changes in normal tissue metabolism. With the recognition that fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging is an important tool for the management of many cancers, other metabolites in biological samples have been in the spotlight for cancer diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy. Metabolomics is the global analysis of small molecule metabolites that like other -omics technologies can provide critical information about the cancer state that are otherwise not apparent. Here, the authors review how cancer and cancer therapies interact with metabolism at the cellular and systemic levels. An overview of metabolomics is provided with a focus on currently available technologies and how they have been applied in the clinical and translational research setting. The authors also discuss how metabolomics could be further leveraged in the future to improve the management of patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DHODH-mediated ferroptosis defence is a targetable vulnerability in cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33981038/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death that is induced by excessive lipid peroxidation, is a key tumour suppression mechanism. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) constitute two major ferroptosis defence systems. Here we show that treatment of cancer cells with GPX4 inhibitors results in acute depletion of N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate, a pyrimidine biosynthesis intermediate, with concomitant accumulation of uridine. Supplementation with dihydroorotate or orotate-the substrate and product of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH)-attenuates or potentiates ferroptosis induced by inhibition of GPX4, respectively, and these effects are particularly pronounced in cancer cells with low expression of GPX4 (GPX4&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;). Inactivation of DHODH induces extensive mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in GPX4&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; cancer cells, and synergizes with ferroptosis inducers to induce these effects in GPX4&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cancer cells. Mechanistically, DHODH operates in parallel to mitochondrial GPX4 (but independently of cytosolic GPX4 or FSP1) to inhibit ferroptosis in the mitochondrial inner membrane by reducing ubiquinone to ubiquinol (a radical-trapping antioxidant with anti-ferroptosis activity). The DHODH inhibitor brequinar selectively suppresses GPX4&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; tumour growth by inducing ferroptosis, whereas combined treatment with brequinar and sulfasalazine, an FDA-approved drug with ferroptosis-inducing activity, synergistically induces ferroptosis and suppresses GPX4&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; tumour growth. Our results identify a DHODH-mediated ferroptosis defence mechanism in mitochondria and suggest a therapeutic strategy of targeting ferroptosis in cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FUT8-mediated aberrant N-glycosylation of B7H3 suppresses the immune response in triple-negative breast cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33976130/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) do not respond to anti-PD1/PDL1 immunotherapy, indicating the necessity to explore immune checkpoint targets. B7H3 is a highly glycosylated protein. However, the mechanisms of B7H3 glycosylation regulation and whether the sugar moiety contributes to immunosuppression are unclear. Here, we identify aberrant B7H3 glycosylation and show that N-glycosylation of B7H3 at NXT motif sites is responsible for its protein stability and immunosuppression in TNBC tumors. The fucosyltransferase FUT8 catalyzes B7H3 core fucosylation at N-glycans to maintain its high expression. Knockdown of FUT8 rescues glycosylated B7H3-mediated immunosuppressive function in TNBC cells. Abnormal B7H3 glycosylation mediated by FUT8 overexpression can be physiologically important and clinically relevant in patients with TNBC. Notably, the combination of core fucosylation inhibitor 2F-Fuc and anti-PDL1 results in enhanced therapeutic efficacy in B7H3-positive TNBC tumors. These findings suggest that targeting the FUT8-B7H3 axis might be a promising strategy for improving anti-tumor immune responses in patients with TNBC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The inhibitory receptor TIM-3 limits activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in intra-tumoral dendritic cells by suppressing extracellular DNA uptake</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockade of the inhibitory receptor TIM-3 shows efficacy in cancer immunotherapy clinical trials. TIM-3 inhibits production of the chemokine CXCL9 by XCR1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; classical dendritic cells (cDC1), thereby limiting antitumor immunity in mammary carcinomas. We found that increased CXCL9 expression by splenic cDC1s upon TIM-3 blockade required type I interferons and extracellular DNA. Chemokine expression as well as combinatorial efficacy of TIM-3 blockade and paclitaxel chemotherapy were impaired by deletion of Cgas and Sting. TIM-3 blockade increased uptake of extracellular DNA by cDC1 through an endocytic process that resulted in cytoplasmic localization. DNA uptake and efficacy of TIM-3 blockade required DNA binding by HMGB1, while galectin-9-induced cell surface clustering of TIM-3 was necessary for its suppressive function. Human peripheral blood cDC1s also took up extracellular DNA upon TIM-3 blockade. Thus, TIM-3 regulates endocytosis of extracellular DNA and activation of the cytoplasmic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway in cDC1s, with implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying TIM-3 immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung cancer organoids analyzed on microwell arrays predict drug responses of patients within a week</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the potential of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) to predict patients&amp;rsquo; responses to anti-cancer treatments has been well recognized, the lengthy time and the low efficiency in establishing PDOs hamper the implementation of PDO-based drug sensitivity tests in clinics. We first adapt a mechanical sample processing method to generate lung cancer organoids (LCOs) from surgically resected and biopsy tumor tissues. The LCOs recapitulate the histological and genetic features of the parental tumors and have the potential to expand indefinitely. By employing an integrated superhydrophobic microwell array chip (InSMAR-chip), we demonstrate hundreds of LCOs, a number that can be generated from most of the samples at passage 0, are sufficient to produce clinically meaningful drug responses within a week. The results prove our one-week drug tests are in good agreement with patient-derived xenografts, genetic mutations of tumors, and clinical outcomes. The LCO model coupled with the microwell device provides a technically feasible means for predicting patient-specific drug responses in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long noncoding RNAs in cancer metastasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/33953369/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metastasis is a major contributor to cancer-associated deaths. It is characterized by a multistep process that occurs through the acquisition of molecular and phenotypic changes enabling cancer cells from a primary tumour to disseminate and colonize at distant organ sites. Over the past decade, the discovery and characterization of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have revealed the diversity of their regulatory roles, including key contributions throughout the metastatic cascade. Here, we review how lncRNAs promote metastasis by functioning in discrete pro-metastatic steps including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion and migration and organotrophic colonization, and by influencing the metastatic tumour microenvironment, often by interacting within ribonucleoprotein complexes or directly with other nucleic acid entities. We discuss well-characterized lncRNAs with in vivo phenotypes and highlight mechanistic commonalities such as convergence with the TGFβ-ZEB1/ZEB2 axis or the nuclear factor-κB pathway, in addition to lncRNAs with controversial mechanisms and the influence of methodologies on mechanistic interpretation. Furthermore, some lncRNAs can help identify tumours with increased metastatic risk and spur novel therapeutic strategies, with several lncRNAs having shown potential as novel targets for antisense oligonucleotide therapy in animal models. In addition to well-characterized examples of lncRNAs functioning in metastasis, we discuss controversies and ongoing challenges in lncRNA biology. Finally, we present areas for future study for this rapidly evolving field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Delivering Antisense Oligonucleotides across the Blood-Brain Barrier by Tumor Cell-Derived Small Apoptotic Bodies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34258157/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the most restrictive and complicated barrier that keeps most biomolecules and drugs from the brain. An efficient brain delivery strategy is urgently needed for the treatment of brain diseases. Based on the studies of brain-targeting extracellular vesicles (EVs), the potential of using small apoptotic bodies (sABs) from brain metastatic cancer cells for brain-targeting drug delivery is explored. It is found that anti-TNF-α antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) combined with cationic konjac glucomannan (cKGM) can be successfully loaded into sABs via a transfection/apoptosis induction process and that the sABs generated by B16F10 cells have an extraordinarily high brain delivery efficiency. Further studies suggest that ASO-loaded sABs (sCABs) are transcytosed by b. End3 (brain microvascular endothelial cells, BMECs) to penetrate the BBB, which is mediated by CD44v6, and eventually taken up by microglial cells in the brain. In a Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) mouse model, sCABs dramatically ameliorate PD symptoms via the anti-inflammatory effect of ASO. This study suggests that sABs from brain metastatic cancer cells are excellent carriers for brain-targeted delivery, as they have not only an extraordinary delivery efficiency but also a much higher scale-up production potential than other EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cancer-derived exosomal miR-138-5p modulates polarization of tumor-associated macrophages through inhibition of KDM6B</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34093857/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Differential activation of macrophages correlates closely with tumor progression, and the epigenetic factor lysine demethylase 6B (KDM6B, previously named JMJD3) mediates the regulation of macrophage polarization through an unknown mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We developed a suspension coculture system comprising breast cancer cells and macrophages and used RT-qPCR and western blotting to measure &lt;em&gt;KDM6B&lt;/em&gt; expression. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays were used to identify candidate microRNAs of cancer cells responsible for the downregulation of KDM6B. To determine if exosomes mediated the transfer of miR-138-5p between cancer cells to macrophages, we treated macrophages with exosomes collected from the conditioned medium of cancer cells. The effects of exosomal miR-138-5p on macrophage polarization were measured using RT-qPCR, flow cytometry, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We employed a mouse model of breast cancer, metastatic to the lung, to evaluate the effects on tumor metastasis of macrophages treated with miR-138-5p-enriched exosomes. To develop a diagnostic evaluation index, the levels of exosomal miR-138-5p in samples from patients with breast cancer were compared to those of controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Coculture of breast cancer cells led to downregulation of &lt;em&gt;KDM6B&lt;/em&gt; expression in macrophages. Cancer cell-derived exosomal miR-138-5p inhibited M1 polarization and promoted M2 polarization through inhibition of &lt;em&gt;KDM6B&lt;/em&gt; expression in macrophages. Macrophages treated with exosomal miR-138-5p promoted lung metastasis, and the level of circulating exosomal miR-138-5p positively correlated with the progression of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our data suggest that miR-138-5p was delivered from breast cancer cells to tumor-associated macrophages via exosomes to downregulate &lt;em&gt;KDM6B&lt;/em&gt; expression, inhibit M1 polarization, and stimulate M2 polarization. Therefore, exosomal miR-138-5p represents a promising prognostic marker and target for the treatment of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chronic infection, inflammation and cancer, the tissue microenvironment controls how local immune cells behave, with tissue-resident fibroblasts emerging as a key cell type in regulating activation or suppression of an immune response. Fibroblasts are heterogeneous cells, encompassing functionally distinct populations, the phenotypes of which differ according to their tissue of origin and type of inciting disease. Their immunological properties are also diverse, ranging from the maintenance of a potent inflammatory environment in chronic inflammation to promoting immunosuppression in malignancy, and encapsulating and incarcerating infectious agents within tissues. In this Review, we compare the mechanisms by which fibroblasts control local immune responses, as well as the factors regulating their inflammatory and suppressive profiles, in different tissues and pathological settings. This cross-disease perspective highlights the importance of tissue context in determining fibroblast-immune cell interactions, as well as potential therapeutic avenues to exploit this knowledge for the benefit of patients with chronic infection, inflammation and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeted inhibition of SIRT6 via engineered exosomes impairs tumorigenesis and metastasis in prostate cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33995674/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients remains a great challenge in the clinic and continuously demands discoveries of new targets and therapies. Here, we assess the function and therapeutic value of SIRT6 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression of SIRT6 was examined in prostate cancer tissue microarray by immunohistochemistry staining. The functions of SIRT6 and underlying mechanisms were elucidated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. We also developed an efficient method to silence SIRT6 by aptamer-modified exosomes carrying small interfering RNA and tested the therapeutic effect in the xenograft mice models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIRT6 expression is positively correlated with prostate cancer progression. Loss of SIRT6 significantly suppressed proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. SIRT6-driven prostate cancer displays activation of multiple cancer-related signaling pathways, especially the Notch pathway. Silencing SIRT6 by siRNA delivered through engineered exosomes inhibited tumor growth and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIRT6 is identified as a driver and therapeutic target for metastatic prostate cancer in our findings, and inhibition of SIRT6 by engineered exosomes can serve as a promising therapeutic tool for clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but efficacy remains limited in most clinical settings. Cancer is a systemic disease that induces many functional and compositional changes to the immune system as a whole. Immunity is regulated by interactions of diverse cell lineages across tissues. Therefore, an improved understanding of tumour immunology must assess the systemic immune landscape beyond the tumour microenvironment (TME). Importantly, the peripheral immune system is required to drive effective natural and therapeutically induced antitumour immune responses. In fact, emerging evidence suggests that immunotherapy drives new immune responses rather than the reinvigoration of pre-existing immune responses. However, new immune responses in individuals burdened with tumours are compromised even beyond the TME. Herein, we aim to comprehensively outline the current knowledge of systemic immunity in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A tumor-suppressive circular RNA mediates uncanonical integrin degradation by the proteasome in liver cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33762338/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of various cellular processes and have been implicated in cancer. Previously, we reported the discovery of several dysregulated circRNAs including circPABPC1 (polyadenylate-binding protein 1) in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although their roles in HCC development remained unclear. Here, we show that circPABPC1 is preferentially lost in tumor cells from clinical samples and inhibits both intrahepatic and distant metastases in a mouse xenograft model. This tumor-suppressive function of circPABPC1 can be attributed to its inhibition of cell adhesion and migration through down-regulating a key member of the integrin family, ITGB1 (β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; integrin). Mass spectrometry and biochemical evidence demonstrate that circPABPC1 directly links ITGB1 to the 26S proteasome for degradation in a ubiquitination-independent manner. Our data have revealed an uncanonical route for integrin turnover and a previously unidentified mode of action for circRNAs in HCC that can be harnessed for anticancer&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>miRNA-mediated loss of m6A increases nascent translation in glioblastoma</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the glioblastoma cellular niche, glioma stem cells (GSCs) can give rise to differentiated glioma cells (DGCs) and, when necessary, DGCs can reciprocally give rise to GSCs to maintain the cellular equilibrium necessary for optimal tumor growth. Here, using ribosome profiling, transcriptome and m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A RNA sequencing, we show that GSCs from patients with different subtypes of glioblastoma share a set of transcripts, which exhibit a pattern of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A loss and increased protein translation during differentiation. The target sequences of a group of miRNAs overlap the canonical RRACH m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A motifs of these transcripts, many of which confer a survival advantage in glioblastoma. Ectopic expression of the RRACH-binding miR-145 induces loss of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, formation of FTO/AGO1/ILF3/miR-145 complexes on a clinically relevant tumor suppressor gene (CLIP3) and significant increase in its nascent translation. Inhibition of miR-145 maintains RRACH m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels of CLIP3 and inhibits its nascent translation. This study highlights a critical role of miRNAs in assembling complexes for m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A demethylation and induction of protein translation during GSC state transition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SRSF1 inhibits autophagy through regulating Bcl-x splicing and interacting with PIK3C3 in lung cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33664238/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative splicing is a critical process to generate protein diversity. However, whether and how alternative splicing regulates autophagy remains largely elusive. Here we systematically identify the splicing factor SRSF1 as an autophagy suppressor. Specifically, SRSF1 inhibits autophagosome formation by reducing the accumulation of LC3-II and numbers of autophagosomes in different cell lines. Mechanistically, SRSF1 promotes the splicing of the long isoform of Bcl-x that interacts with Beclin1, thereby dissociating the Beclin1-PIK3C3 complex. In addition, SRSF1 also directly interacts with PIK3C3 to disrupt the interaction between Beclin1 and PIK3C3. Consequently, the decrease of SRSF1 stabilizes the Beclin1 and PIK3C3 complex and activates autophagy. Interestingly, SRSF1 can be degraded by starvation- and oxidative stresses-induced autophagy through interacting with LC3-II, whereas reduced SRSF1 further promotes autophagy. This positive feedback is critical to inhibiting Gefitinib-resistant cancer cell progression both in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, the expression level of SRSF1 is inversely correlated to LC3 level in clinical cancer samples. Our study not only provides mechanistic insights of alternative splicing in autophagy regulation but also discovers a new regulatory role of SRSF1 in tumorigenesis, thereby offering a novel avenue for potential cancer therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extracellular matrix is a fundamental, core component of all tissues and organs, and is essential for the existence of multicellular organisms. From the earliest stages of organism development until death, it regulates and fine-tunes every cellular process in the body. In cancer, the extracellular matrix is altered at the biochemical, biomechanical, architectural and topographical levels, and recent years have seen an exponential increase in the study and recognition of the importance of the matrix in solid tumours. Coupled with the advancement of new technologies to study various elements of the matrix and cell-matrix interactions, we are also beginning to see the deployment of matrix-centric, stromal targeting cancer therapies. This Review touches on many of the facets of matrix biology in solid cancers, including breast, pancreatic and lung cancer, with the aim of highlighting some of the emerging interactions of the matrix and influences that the matrix has on tumour onset, progression and metastatic dissemination, before summarizing the ongoing work in the field aimed at developing therapies to co-target the matrix in cancer and cancer metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Downregulation of nc886 contributes to prostate cancer cell invasion and TGFβ1-induced EMT</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35685460/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) activation is important in cancer progression and metastasis. Evidence indicates that &lt;em&gt;nc886&lt;/em&gt; is a representative Pol III gene that processes microRNA products via Dicer and further downregulates its target gene transforming growth factor- β1 (TGF-β1), which is the most prominent inducer of EMT in prostate cancer (PC). Consistent with the previous literature, we found that &lt;em&gt;nc886&lt;/em&gt; downregulation was strongly associated with metastatic behavior and showed worse outcomes in PC patients. However, little is known about the association between &lt;em&gt;nc886&lt;/em&gt; and the EMT signaling pathway. We developed a PC cell model with stable overexpression of &lt;em&gt;nc886&lt;/em&gt; and found that &lt;em&gt;nc886&lt;/em&gt; changed cellular morphology and drove MET. The underlying mechanism may be related to its promotion of SNAIL protein degradation via ubiquitination, but not to its neighboring genes, TGFβ-induced protein (&lt;em&gt;TGFBI&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;SMAD5&lt;/em&gt;, which are Pol II-transcribed. TGF-β1 also override &lt;em&gt;nc886&lt;/em&gt; promotion of MET via transient suppression the transcription of &lt;em&gt;nc886&lt;/em&gt;, promotion of &lt;em&gt;TGFBI&lt;/em&gt; or increase in SMAD5 phosphorylation. Both &lt;em&gt;nc886&lt;/em&gt; inhibition and &lt;em&gt;TGFBI&lt;/em&gt; activation occur regardless of their methylation status. The literature suggests that MYC inhibition by TGF-β1 is attributed to &lt;em&gt;nc886&lt;/em&gt; downregulation. We incidentally identified MYC-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) as a suppressive transcription factor of TGFBI, which is controlled by TGF-β1. We elucidate a new mechanism of TGF-β1 differential control of Pol II and the transcription of its neighboring Pol III gene and identify a new EMT unit consisting of &lt;em&gt;nc886&lt;/em&gt; and its neighboring genes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Broadening horizons: the role of ferroptosis in cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/33514910/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of regulated cell death processes has enabled advances in cancer treatment. In the past decade, ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by excessive lipid peroxidation, has been implicated in the development and therapeutic responses of various types of tumours. Experimental reagents (such as erastin and RSL3), approved drugs (for example, sorafenib, sulfasalazine, statins and artemisinin), ionizing radiation and cytokines (such as IFNγ and TGFβ1) can induce ferroptosis and suppress tumour growth. However, ferroptotic damage can trigger inflammation-associated immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment, thus favouring tumour growth. The extent to which ferroptosis affects tumour biology is unclear, although several studies have found important correlations between mutations in cancer-relevant genes (for example, &lt;em&gt;RAS&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt;), in genes encoding proteins involved in stress response pathways (such as NFE2L2 signalling, autophagy and hypoxia) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and responses to treatments that activate ferroptosis. Herein, we present the key molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis, describe the crosstalk between ferroptosis and tumour-associated signalling pathways, and discuss the potential applications of ferroptosis in the context of systemic therapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heat Shock Factor 1-dependent extracellular matrix remodeling mediates the transition from chronic intestinal inflammation to colon cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33288768/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the colon, long-term exposure to chronic inflammation drives colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. While the causal and clinical links are well established, molecular understanding of how chronic inflammation leads to the development of colon cancer is lacking. Here we deconstruct the evolving microenvironment of CAC by measuring proteomic changes and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization over time in a mouse model of CAC. We detect early changes in ECM structure and composition, and report a crucial role for the transcriptional regulator heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in orchestrating these events. Loss of HSF1 abrogates ECM assembly by colon fibroblasts in cell-culture, prevents inflammation-induced ECM remodeling in mice and inhibits progression to CAC. Establishing relevance to human disease, we find high activation of stromal HSF1 in CAC patients, and detect the HSF1-dependent proteomic ECM signature in human colorectal cancer. Thus, HSF1-dependent ECM remodeling plays a crucial role in mediating inflammation-driven colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcriptome-wide profiles of circular RNA and RNA-binding protein interactions reveal effects on circular RNA biogenesis and cancer pathway expression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33287884/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are stable, often highly expressed RNA transcripts with potential to modulate other regulatory RNAs. A few circRNAs have been shown to bind RNA-binding proteins (RBPs); however, little is known about the prevalence and distribution of these interactions in different biological contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We conduct an extensive screen of circRNA-RBP interactions in the ENCODE cell lines HepG2 and K562. We profile circRNAs in deep-sequenced total RNA samples and analyze circRNA-RBP interactions using a large set of eCLIP data with binding sites of 150 RBPs. We validate interactions for select circRNAs and RBPs by performing RNA immunoprecipitation and functionally characterize our most interesting candidates by conducting knockdown studies followed by RNA-Seq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We generate a comprehensive catalog of circRNA-RBP interactions in HepG2 and K562 cells. We show that KHSRP binding sites are enriched in flanking introns of circRNAs and that KHSRP depletion affects circRNA biogenesis. We identify circRNAs that are highly covered by RBP binding sites and experimentally validate individual circRNA-RBP interactions. We show that circCDYL, a highly expressed circRNA with clinical and functional implications in bladder cancer, is almost completely covered with GRWD1 binding sites in HepG2 cells, and that circCDYL depletion counteracts the effect of GRWD1 depletion. Furthermore, we confirm interactions between circCDYL and RBPs in bladder cancer cells and demonstrate that circCDYL depletion affects hallmarks of cancer and perturbs the expression of key cancer genes, e.g., TP53. Finally, we show that elevated levels of circCDYL are associated with overall survival of bladder cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study demonstrates transcriptome-wide and cell-type-specific circRNA-RBP interactions that could play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered the roots of cancer metastasis and recurrence (CSCs), due in part to their self-renewal and therapy resistance properties. However, the underlying mechanisms for the regulation of CSC stemness are poorly understood. Recently, increasing evidence shows that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators for cancer cell function in various malignancies including breast cancer, but how lncRNAs regulate the function of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) remains to be determined. Herein, using lncRNA/mRNA microarray assays, a novel lncRNA (named lnc030) is identified, which is highly expressed in BCSCs in vitro and in vivo, as a pivotal regulator in maintaining BCSC stemness and promoting tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, lnc030 cooperates with poly(rC) binding protein 2(PCBP2) to stabilize squalene epoxidase (SQLE) mRNA, resulting in an increase of cholesterol synthesis. The increased cholesterol in turn actives PI3K/Akt signaling, which governs BCSC stemness. In summary, these findings demonstrate that a new, lnc030-based mechanism for regulating cholesterol synthesis and stemness properties of BCSCs. The lnc030-SQLE-cholesterol synthesis pathway may serve as an effective therapeutic target for BCSC elimination and breast cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>microRNA-199a-3p inhibits hepatic apoptosis and hepatocarcinogenesis by targeting PDCD4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatic apoptosis and the initiated liver inflammation play the initial roles in inflammation-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of hepatocyte apoptosis and their roles in hepatocarcinogenesis have attracted much attention. A set of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been determined to be dysregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and participated in cancer progression, however, the roles of these dysregulated miRNAs in carcinogenesis are still poorly understood. We previously analyzed the dysregulated miRNAs in HCC using high-throughput sequencing, and found that miR-199a/b-3p was abundantly expressed in human normal liver while markedly decreased in HCC, which promotes HCC progression. Whether miR-199a/b-3p participates in HCC carcinogenesis is still unknown up to now. Hence, we focused on the role and mechanism of miR-199a/b-3p in hepatocarcinogenesis in this study. Hepatic miR-199a/b-3p was determined to be expressed by miR-199a-2 gene in mice, and we constructed miR-199a-2 knockout and hepatocyte-specific miR-199a-2 knockout mice. Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis were markedly increased by hepatocyte-specific miR-199a-3p knockout, which is mediated by the enhanced hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic injury by DEN administration. In acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute hepatic injury model, hepatocyte-specific miR-199a-3p knockout also aggravated hepatic apoptosis. By proteomic screening and reporter gene validation, we identified and verified that hepatic programed cell death 4 (PDCD4), which promotes apoptosis, was directly targeted by miR-199a-3p. Furthermore, we confirmed that miR-199a-3p-suppressed hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic injury by targeting and suppressing PDCD4. Thus, hepatic miR-199a-3p inhibits hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatocarcinogenesis, and decreased miR-199a-3p in hepatocytes may aggravate hepatic injury and HCC development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TSPAN1 promotes autophagy flux and mediates cooperation between WNT-CTNNB1 signaling and autophagy via the MIR454-FAM83A-TSPAN1 axis in pancreatic cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive tumors associated with a poor clinical prognosis, weakly effective therapeutic options. Therefore, there is a strong impetus to discover new therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer. In the present study, we first demonstrated that TSPAN1 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer and that TSPAN1 depletion decreases pancreatic cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. TSPAN1 expression was correlated with poor overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Moreover, we demonstrated that TSPAN1 is a novel positive regulator of macroautophagy/autophagy characterized by decreased LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 expressions, inhibited puncta formation of GFP-LC3 and autophagic vacuoles. We also demonstrated that tspan1 mutation impaired autophagy in the zebrafish model. Furthermore, we showed that TSPAN1 promoted autophagy maturation via direct binding to LC3 by two conserved LIR motifs. Mutations in the LIR motifs of TSPAN1 resulted in a loss of the ability to induce autophagy and promote pancreatic cancer proliferation. Second, we discovered two conservative TCF/LEF binding elements present in the promoter region of the TSPAN1 gene, which was further verified through luciferase activity and ChIP assays. Furthermore, TSPAN1 was upregulated by FAM83A through the canonical WNT-CTNNB1 signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that both TSPAN1 and FAM83A are both direct targets of MIR454 (microRNA 454). Additionally, we revealed the role of MIR454-FAM83A-TSPAN1 in the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that components of the MIR454-FAM83A-TSPAN1 axis may be valuable prognosis markers or therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Translation of noncoding RNAs and cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ncRNAs are translated into stable peptides or proteins, expanding the landscape of the proteome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tools, methods and databases are designed for identifying and validating ncRNA-encoded peptides related with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The translation of lncRNAs provides a novel molecular mechanism to participate in complex regulatory networks of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CircRNA-encoded peptides in cancer may become drug targets and biomarkers for diagnosing or predicting the prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human genome contains thousands of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are thought to lack open reading frames (ORFs) and cannot be translated. Some ncRNAs reportedly have important functions, including epigenetic regulation, chromatin remolding, protein modification, and RNA degradation, but the functions of most ncRNAs remain elusive. Through the application and development of ribosome profiling and sequencing technologies, an increasing number of studies have discovered the translation of ncRNAs. Although ncRNAs were initially defined as noncoding RNAs, a number of ncRNAs actually contain ORFs that are translated into peptides. Here, we summarize the available methods, tools, and databases for identifying and validating ncRNA-encoded peptides/proteins, and the recent findings regarding ncRNA-encoded small peptides/proteins in cancer are compiled and synthesized. Importantly, the role of ncRNA-encoding peptides/proteins has application prospects in cancer research, but some potential challenges remain unresolved. The aim of this review is to provide a theoretical basis that might promote the discovery of more peptides/proteins encoded by ncRNAs and aid the further development of novel diagnostic and prognostic cancer markers and therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organoids Model Transcriptional Hallmarks of Oncogenic KRAS Activation in Lung Epithelial Progenitor Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32891189/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alveolar epithelial progenitor cells are transcriptionally distinct upon KRAS expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alveolar epithelial organoids recapitulate early-stage lung adenocarcinoma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oncogenic KRAS leads to loss of lineage identity in AT2 cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bulk, scRNA-seq, and proteomics data from murine and human KRAS mutant AT2 cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutant KRAS is a common driver in epithelial cancers. Nevertheless, molecular changes occurring early after activation of oncogenic KRAS in epithelial cells remain poorly understood. We compared transcriptional changes at single-cell resolution after KRAS activation in four sample sets. In addition to patient samples and genetically engineered mouse models, we developed organoid systems from primary mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived lung epithelial cells to model early-stage lung adenocarcinoma. In all four settings, alveolar epithelial progenitor (AT2) cells expressing oncogenic KRAS had reduced expression of mature lineage identity genes. These findings demonstrate the utility of our in vitro organoid approaches for uncovering the early consequences of oncogenic KRAS expression. This resource provides an extensive collection of datasets and describes organoid tools to study the transcriptional and proteomic changes that distinguish normal epithelial progenitor cells from early-stage lung cancer, facilitating the search for targets for KRAS-driven tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted cancer therapy aims to achieve specific elimination of cancerous but not normal cells. Recently, PIWI proteins, a subfamily of the PAZ-PIWI domain (PPD) protein family, have emerged as promising candidates for targeted cancer therapy. PPD proteins are essential for small noncoding RNA pathways. The Argonaute subfamily partners with microRNA and small interfering RNA, whereas the PIWI subfamily partners with PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA). Both PIWI proteins and piRNA are mostly expressed in the germline and best known for their function in transposon silencing, with no detectable function in mammalian somatic tissues. However, PIWI proteins become aberrantly expressed in multiple types of somatic cancers, thus gaining interest in targeted therapy. Despite this, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of PIWI proteins in cancer. Here we report that one of the four PIWI proteins in humans, PIWIL1, is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Knocking out the PIWIL1 gene (&lt;em&gt;PIWIL1-KO&lt;/em&gt;) drastically reduces gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, metastasis, and tumorigenesis. RNA deep sequencing of gastric cancer cell line SNU-1 reveals that KO significantly changes the transcriptome, causing the up-regulation of most of its associated transcripts. Surprisingly, few bona fide piRNAs exist in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, abolishing the piRNA-binding activity of PIWIL1 does not affect its oncogenic function. Thus, PIWIL1 function in gastric cancer cells is independent of piRNA. This piRNA-independent regulation involves interaction with the UPF1-mediated nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) mechanism. Altogether, our findings reveal a piRNA-independent function of PIWIL1 in promoting gastric cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lactate modulation of immune responses in inflammatory versus tumour microenvironments</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microenvironment in cancerous tissues is immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic, whereas the microenvironment of tissues affected by chronic inflammatory disease is pro-inflammatory and anti-resolution. Despite these opposing immunological states, the metabolic states in the tissue microenvironments of cancer and inflammatory diseases are similar: both are hypoxic, show elevated levels of lactate and other metabolic by-products and have low levels of nutrients. In this Review, we describe how the bioavailability of lactate differs in the microenvironments of tumours and inflammatory diseases compared with normal tissues, thus contributing to the establishment of specific immunological states in disease. A clear understanding of the metabolic signature of tumours and inflammatory diseases will enable therapeutic intervention aimed at resetting the bioavailability of metabolites and correcting the dysregulated immunological state, triggering beneficial cytotoxic, inflammatory responses in tumours and immunosuppressive responses in chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UFMylation maintains tumour suppressor p53 stability by antagonizing its ubiquitination</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p53 is the most intensively studied tumour suppressor. The regulation of p53 homeostasis is essential for its tumour-suppressive function. Although p53 is regulated by an array of post-translational modifications, both during normal homeostasis and in stress-induced responses, how p53 maintains its homeostasis remains unclear. UFMylation is a recently identified ubiquitin-like modification with essential biological functions. Deficiency in this modification leads to embryonic lethality in mice and disease in humans. Here, we report that p53 can be covalently modified by UFM1 and that this modification stabilizes p53 by antagonizing its ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Mechanistically, UFL1, the UFM1 ligase, competes with MDM2 to bind to p53 for its stabilization. Depletion of UFL1 or DDRGK1, the critical regulator of UFMylation6,13, decreases p53 stability and in turn promotes cell growth and tumour formation in vivo. Clinically, UFL1 and DDRGK1 expression are downregulated and positively correlated with levels of p53 in a high percentage of renal cell carcinomas. Our results identify UFMylation as a crucial post-translational modification for maintenance of p53 stability and tumour-suppressive function, and point to UFMylation as a promising therapeutic target in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA PVT1 promotes gemcitabine resistance of pancreatic cancer via activating Wnt/β-catenin and autophagy pathway through modulating the miR-619-5p/Pygo2 and miR-619-5p/ATG14 axes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32727463/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies and has an extremely poor diagnosis and prognosis. The development of resistance to gemcitabine is still a major challenge. The long noncoding RNA PVT1 was reported to be involved in carcinogenesis and chemoresistance; however, the mechanism by which PVT1 regulates the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine remains poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The viability of pancreatic cancer cells was assessed by MTT assay in vitro and xenograft tumor formation assay in vivo. The expression levels of PVT1 and miR-619-5p were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Western blotting analysis and qRT-PCR were performed to assess the protein and mRNA levels of Pygo2 and ATG14, respectively. Autophagy was explored via autophagic flux detection under confocal microscopy and autophagic vacuole investigation under transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The functional role and mechanism of PVT1 were further investigated by gain- and loss-of-function assays in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we demonstrated that PVT1 was up-regulated in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines. Gain- and loss-of-function assays revealed that PVT1 impaired sensitivity to gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo. We further found that PVT1 up-regulated the expression of both Pygo2 and ATG14 and thus regulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling and autophagic activity to overcome gemcitabine resistance through sponging miR-619-5p. Moreover, we discovered three TCF/LEF binding elements (TBEs) in the promoter region of PVT1, and activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling mediated by the up-regulation of Pygo2 increased PVT1 expression by direct binding to the TBE region. Furthermore, PVT1 was discovered to interact with ATG14, thus promoting assembly of the autophagy specific complex I (PtdIns3K-C1) and ATG14-dependent class III PtdIns3K activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data indicate that PVT1 plays a critical role in the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine and highlight its potential as a valuable target for pancreatic cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil diversity and plasticity in tumour progression and therapy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils play a key role in defence against infection and in the activation and regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. In cancer, tumour-associated neutrophils (TANs) have emerged as an important component of the tumour microenvironment. Here, they can exert dual functions. TANs can be part of tumour-promoting inflammation by driving angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodelling, metastasis and immunosuppression. Conversely, neutrophils can also mediate antitumour responses by direct killing of tumour cells and by participating in cellular networks that mediate antitumour resistance. Neutrophil diversity and plasticity underlie the dual potential of TANs in the tumour microenvironment. Myeloid checkpoints as well as the tumour and tissue contexture shape neutrophil function in response to conventional therapies and immunotherapy. We surmise that neutrophils can provide tools to tailor current immunotherapy strategies and pave the way to myeloid cell-centred therapeutic strategies, which would be complementary to current approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Roadmap for the Future of Colorectal Cancer Screening in the United States</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Gastroenterological Association&amp;rsquo;s Center for Gastrointestinal Innovation and Technology convened a consensus conference in December 2018, entitled, &amp;ldquo;Colorectal Cancer Screening and Surveillance: Role of Emerging Technology and Innovation to Improve Outcomes.&amp;rdquo; The goal of the conference, which attracted more than 60 experts in screening and related disciplines, including the authors, was to envision a future in which colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and surveillance are optimized, and to identify barriers to achieving that future. This White Paper originates from that meeting and delineates the priorities and steps needed to improve CRC outcomes, with the goal of minimizing CRC morbidity and mortality. A one-size-fits-all approach to CRC screening has not and is unlikely to result in increased screening uptake or desired outcomes owing to barriers stemming from behavioral, cultural, and socioeconomic causes, especially when combined with inefficiencies in deployment of screening technologies. Overcoming these barriers will require the following: efficient utilization of multiple screening modalities to achieve increased uptake; continued development of noninvasive screening tests, with iterative reassessments of how best to integrate new technologies; and improved personal risk assessment to better risk-stratify patients for appropriate screening testing paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chronic circadian disruption modulates breast cancer stemness and immune microenvironment to drive metastasis in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer worldwide and one of the major causes of cancer death in women. Epidemiological studies have established a link between night-shift work and increased cancer risk, suggesting that circadian disruption may play a role in carcinogenesis. Here, we aim to shed light on the effect of chronic jetlag (JL) on mammary tumour development. To do this, we use a mouse model of spontaneous mammary tumourigenesis and subject it to chronic circadian disruption. We observe that circadian disruption significantly increases cancer-cell dissemination and lung metastasis. It also enhances the stemness and tumour-initiating potential of tumour cells and creates an immunosuppressive shift in the tumour microenvironment. Finally, our results suggest that the use of a CXCR2 inhibitor could correct the effect of JL on cancer-cell dissemination and metastasis. Altogether, our data provide a conceptual framework to better understand and manage the effects of chronic circadian disruption on breast cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interferon regulatory factor 1 regulates PANoptosis to prevent colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) regulates diverse biological functions, including modulation of cellular responses involved in tumorigenesis. Genetic mutations and altered IRF1 function are associated with several cancers. Although the function of IRF1 in the immunobiology of cancer is emerging, IRF1-specific mechanisms regulating tumorigenesis and tissue homeostasis in vivo are not clear. Here, we found that mice lacking IRF1 were hypersusceptible to colorectal tumorigenesis. IRF1 functions in both the myeloid and epithelial compartments to confer protection against AOM/DSS-induced colorectal tumorigenesis. We further found that IRF1 also prevents tumorigenesis in a spontaneous mouse model of colorectal cancer. The attenuated cell death in the colons of Irf1-/- mice was due to defective pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis). IRF1 does not regulate inflammation and the inflammasome in the colon. Overall, our study identified IRF1 as an upstream regulator of PANoptosis to induce cell death during colitis-associated tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to develop anti-cancer therapies have largely focused on targeting the epithelial compartment, despite the presence of non-neoplastic stromal components that substantially contribute to the progression of the tumor. Indeed, cancer cell survival, growth, migration, and even dormancy are influenced by the surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME). Within the TME, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been shown to play several roles in the development of a tumor. They secrete growth factors, inflammatory ligands, and extracellular matrix proteins that promote cancer cell proliferation, therapy resistance, and immune exclusion. However, recent work indicates that CAFs may also restrain tumor progression in some circumstances. In this review, we summarize the body of work on CAFs, with a particular focus on the most recent discoveries about fibroblast heterogeneity, plasticity, and functions. We also highlight the commonalities of fibroblasts present across different cancer types, and in normal and inflammatory states. Finally, we present the latest advances regarding therapeutic strategies targeting CAFs that are undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>c-Rel Is a Myeloid Checkpoint for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapy that targets lymphoid cell checkpoints holds great promise for curing cancer. However, a majority of cancer patients do not respond to this form of therapy. In addition to lymphoid cells, myeloid cells play essential roles in controlling immunity to cancer. Whether myeloid checkpoints exist that can be targeted to treat cancer is not well established. Here we show that c-Rel, a member of the nuclear factor (NF)-B family, specified the generation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) by selectively turning on pro-tumoral genes while switching off anti-tumoral genes through a c-Rel enhanceosome. c-Rel deficiency in myeloid cells markedly inhibited cancer growth in mice, and pharmaceutical inhibition of c-Rel had the same effect. Combination therapy that blocked both c-Rel and the lymphoid checkpoint protein PD1 was more effective in treating cancer than blocking either alone. Thus, c-Rel is a myeloid checkpoint that can be targeted for treating cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serum interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels and tumor neutrophil infiltration are associated with worse prognosis in advanced cancers. Here, using a large-scale retrospective analysis, we show that elevated baseline serum IL-8 levels are associated with poor outcome in patients (n = 1,344) with advanced cancers treated with nivolumab and/or ipilimumab, everolimus or docetaxel in phase 3 clinical trials, revealing the importance of assessing serum IL-8 levels in identifying unfavorable tumor immunobiology and as an independent biomarker in patients receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although elevated plasma interleukin-8 (pIL-8) has been associated with poor outcome to immune checkpoint blockade 1, this has not been comprehensively evaluated in large randomized studies. Here we analyzed circulating pIL-8 and IL8 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumors of patients treated with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody) from multiple randomized trials representing 1,445 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. High levels of IL-8 in plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumors were associated with decreased efficacy of atezolizumab in patients with mUC and metastatic renal cell carcinoma, even in tumors that were classically CD8+ T cell inflamed. Low baseline pIL-8 in patients with mUC was associated with increased response to atezolizumab and chemotherapy. Patients with mUC who experienced on-treatment decreases in pIL-8 exhibited improved overall survival when treated with atezolizumab but not with chemotherapy. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the immune compartment showed that IL8 is primarily expressed in circulating and intratumoral myeloid cells and that high IL8 expression is associated with downregulation of the antigen-presentation machinery. Therapies that can reverse the impacts of IL-8-mediated myeloid inflammation will be essential for improving outcomes of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autophagy promotes immune evasion of pancreatic cancer by degrading MHC-I</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32376951/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune evasion is a major obstacle for cancer treatment. Common mechanisms of evasion include impaired antigen presentation caused by mutations or loss of heterozygosity of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), which has been implicated in resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is resistant to most therapies including ICB, mutations that cause loss of MHC-I are rarely found despite the frequent downregulation of MHC-I expression. Here we show that, in PDAC, MHC-I molecules are selectively targeted for lysosomal degradation by an autophagy-dependent mechanism that involves the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1. PDAC cells display reduced expression of MHC-I at the cell surface and instead demonstrate predominant localization within autophagosomes and lysosomes. Notably, inhibition of autophagy restores surface levels of MHC-I and leads to improved antigen presentation, enhanced anti-tumour T cell responses and reduced tumour growth in syngeneic host mice. Accordingly, the anti-tumour effects of autophagy inhibition are reversed by depleting CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells or reducing surface expression of MHC-I. Inhibition of autophagy, either genetically or pharmacologically with chloroquine, synergizes with dual ICB therapy (anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies), and leads to an enhanced anti-tumour immune response. Our findings demonstrate a role for enhanced autophagy or lysosome function in immune evasion by selective targeting of MHC-I molecules for degradation, and provide a rationale for the combination of autophagy inhibition and dual ICB therapy as a therapeutic strategy against PDAC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A bioorthogonal system reveals antitumour immune function of pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32188939/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioorthogonal chemistry capable of operating in live animals is needed to investigate biological processes such as cell death and immunity. Recent studies have identified a gasdermin family of pore-forming proteins that executes inflammasome-dependent and -independent pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is proinflammatory, but its effect on antitumour immunity is unknown. Here we establish a bioorthogonal chemical system, in which a cancer-imaging probe phenylalanine trifluoroborate (Phe-BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) that can enter cells desilylates and &amp;lsquo;cleaves&amp;rsquo; a designed linker that contains a silyl ether. This system enabled the controlled release of a drug from an antibody-drug conjugate in mice. When combined with nanoparticle-mediated delivery, desilylation catalysed by Phe-BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; could release a client protein-including an active gasdermin-from a nanoparticle conjugate, selectively into tumour cells in mice. We applied this bioorthogonal system to gasdermin, which revealed that pyroptosis of less than 15% of tumour cells was sufficient to clear the entire 4T1 mammary tumour graft. The tumour regression was absent in immune-deficient mice or upon T cell depletion, and was correlated with augmented antitumour immune responses. The injection of a reduced, ineffective dose of nanoparticle-conjugated gasdermin along with Phe-BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sensitized 4T1 tumours to anti-PD1 therapy. Our bioorthogonal system based on Phe-BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; desilylation is therefore a powerful tool for chemical biology; our application of this system suggests that pyroptosis-induced inflammation triggers robust antitumour immunity and can synergize with checkpoint blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune surveillance against pathogens and tumours in the central nervous system is thought to be limited owing to the lack of lymphatic drainage. However, the characterization of the meningeal lymphatic network has shed light on previously unappreciated ways that an immune response can be elicited to antigens that are expressed in the brain1-3. Despite progress in our understanding of the development and structure of the meningeal lymphatic system, the contribution of this network in evoking a protective antigen-specific immune response in the brain remains unclear. Here, using a mouse model of glioblastoma, we show that the meningeal lymphatic vasculature can be manipulated to mount better immune responses against brain tumours. The immunity that is mediated by CD8 T cells to the glioblastoma antigen is very limited when the tumour is confined to the central nervous system, resulting in uncontrolled tumour growth. However, ectopic expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) promotes enhanced priming of CD8 T cells in the draining deep cervical lymph nodes, migration of CD8 T cells into the tumour, rapid clearance of the glioblastoma and a long-lasting antitumour memory response. Furthermore, transfection of an mRNA construct that expresses VEGF-C works synergistically with checkpoint blockade therapy to eradicate existing glioblastoma. These results reveal the capacity of VEGF-C to promote immune surveillance of tumours, and suggest a new therapeutic approach to treat brain tumours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interpreting pathways to discover cancer driver genes with Moonlight</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31900418/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer driver gene alterations influence cancer development, occurring in oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and dual role genes. Discovering dual role cancer genes is difficult because of their elusive context-dependent behavior. We define oncogenic mediators as genes controlling biological processes. With them, we classify cancer driver genes, unveiling their roles in cancer mechanisms. To this end, we present Moonlight, a tool that incorporates multiple -omics data to identify critical cancer driver genes. With Moonlight, we analyze 8000+ tumor samples from 18 cancer types, discovering 3310 oncogenic mediators, 151 having dual roles. By incorporating additional data (amplification, mutation, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility), we reveal 1000+ cancer driver genes, corroborating known molecular mechanisms. Additionally, we confirm critical cancer driver genes by analysing cell-line datasets. We discover inactivation of tumor suppressors in intron regions and that tissue type and subtype indicate dual role status. These findings help explain tumor heterogeneity and could guide therapeutic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor organoid-T-cell coculture systems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T cells are key players in cancer immunotherapy, but strategies to expand tumor-reactive cells and study their interactions with tumor cells at the level of an individual patient are limited. Here we describe the generation and functional assessment of tumor-reactive T cells based on cocultures of tumor organoids and autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes. The procedure consists of an initial coculture of 2 weeks, in which tumor-reactive T cells are first expanded in the presence of (IFNγ-stimulated) autologous tumor cells. Subsequently, T cells are evaluated for their capacity to carry out effector functions (IFNγ secretion and degranulation) after recognition of tumor cells, and their capacity to kill tumor organoids. This strategy is unique in its use of peripheral blood as a source of tumor-reactive T cells in an antigen-agnostic manner. In 2 weeks, tumor-reactive CD8+ T-cell populations can be obtained from ~33-50% of samples from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and microsatellite-instable colorectal cancer (CRC). This enables the establishment of ex vivo test systems for T-cell-based immunotherapy at the level of the individual patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction to: &lt;a href=&#34;https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-021-01386-8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LncRNA-HGBC stabilized by HuR promotes gallbladder cancer progression by regulating miR-502-3p/SET/AKT axis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Backgrounds:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are essential factors that regulate tumor development and metastasis via diverse molecular mechanisms in a broad type of cancers. However, the pathological roles of lncRNAs in gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) remain largely unknown. Here we discovered a novel lncRNA termed lncRNA Highly expressed in GBC (lncRNA-HGBC) which was upregulated in GBC tissue and aimed to investigate its role and regulatory mechanism in the development and progression of GBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression level of lncRNA-HGBC in GBC tissue and different cell lines was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The full length of lncRNA-HGBC was obtained by 5&amp;rsquo; and 3&amp;rsquo; rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE). Cellular localization of lncRNA-HGBC was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays and subcellular fractionation assay. In vitro and in vivo assays were preformed to explore the biological effects of lncRNA-HGBC in GBC cells. RNA pull-down assay, mass spectrometry, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were used to identify lncRNA-HGBC-interacting proteins. Dual luciferase reporter assays, AGO2-RIP, and MS2-RIP assays were performed to verify the interaction between lncRNA-HGBC and miR-502-3p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that lncRNA-HGBC was upregulated in GBC and its upregulation could predict poor survival. Overexpression or knockdown of lncRNA-HGBC in GBC cell lines resulted in increased or decreased, respectively, cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and in xenografted tumors. LncRNA-HGBC specifically bound to RNA binding protein Hu Antigen R (HuR) that in turn stabilized lncRNA-HGBC. LncRNA-HGBC functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA to bind to miR-502-3p that inhibits target gene SET. Overexpression, knockdown or mutation of lncRNA-HGBC altered the inhibitory effects of miR-502-3p on SET expression and downstream activation of AKT. Clinically, lncRNA-HGBC expression was negatively correlated with miR-502-3p, but positively correlated with SET and HuR in GBC tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study demonstrates that lncRNA-HGBC promotes GBC metastasis via activation of the miR-502-3p-SET-AKT cascade, pointing to lncRNA-HGBC as a new prognostic predictor and a therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organoid Cultures as Preclinical Models of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31694835/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There is an unmet need to develop novel clinically relevant models of NSCLC to accelerate identification of drug targets and our understanding of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental design:&lt;/em&gt; Thirty surgically resected NSCLC primary patient tissue and 35 previously established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were processed for organoid culture establishment. Organoids were histologically and molecularly characterized by cytology and histology, exome sequencing, and RNA-sequencing analysis. Tumorigenicity was assessed through subcutaneous injection of organoids in NOD/SCID mice. Organoids were subjected to drug testing using EGFR, FGFR, and MEK-targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We have identified cell culture conditions favoring the establishment of short-term and long-term expansion of NSCLC organoids derived from primary lung patient and PDX tumor tissue. The NSCLC organoids recapitulated the histology of the patient and PDX tumor. They also retained tumorigenicity, as evidenced by cytologic features of malignancy, xenograft formation, preservation of mutations, copy number aberrations, and gene expression profiles between the organoid and matched parental tumor tissue by whole-exome and RNA sequencing. NSCLC organoid models also preserved the sensitivity of the matched parental tumor to targeted therapeutics, and could be used to validate or discover biomarker-drug combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our panel of NSCLC organoids closely recapitulates the genomics and biology of patient tumors, and is a potential platform for drug testing and biomarker validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer type and a threat to human health. Tumor budding (TB) is the presence of a single cancer cell or clusters of up to five cancer cells prior to the invasive front of an aggressive carcinoma and is an independent prognosis factor for CRC. The molecular mechanism of TB is still unclear, and drugs that inhibit this process are still in the blank stage. This study found that TBs exhibit characteristics of partial EMT with a decreased expression of E-cadherin and no substantial differences in the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin. We also observed the interaction of integrin with extracellular matrix components, laminin-5γ2 (LN-5γ2), play essential roles in the TB of CRC. We then verified that the interaction between LN-5γ2 and integrin β1 promotes the TB of CRC via the activation of FAK and Yes-associated proteins (YAP). A natural drug monomer, cucurbitacin B, was screened using virtual screening methods for the interaction interface of proteins. We found that this monomer could block the interaction interface between LN-5γ2 and integrin β1 and substantially inhibit the TB of CRC cells via inactivation of YAP. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of TB mechanism and the development of drugs targeting the TB of CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial fragmentation limits NK cell-based tumor immunosurveillance</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural killer (NK) cells have crucial roles in tumor surveillance. We found that tumor-infiltrating NK cells in human liver cancers had small, fragmented mitochondria in their cytoplasm, whereas liver NK cells outside tumors, as well as peripheral NK cells, had normal large, tubular mitochondria. This fragmentation was correlated with reduced cytotoxicity and NK cell loss, resulting in tumor evasion of NK cell-mediated surveillance, which predicted poor survival in patients with liver cancer. The hypoxic tumor microenvironment drove the sustained activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin-GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (mTOR-Drp1) in NK cells, resulting in excessive mitochondrial fission into fragments. Inhibition of mitochondrial fragmentation improved mitochondrial metabolism, survival and the antitumor capacity of NK cells. These data reveal a mechanism of immune escape that might be targetable and could invigorate NK cell-based cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer shows substantial genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity across individuals, driving a need for personalised medicine. Here, we report lung cancer organoids and normal bronchial organoids established from patient tissues comprising five histological subtypes of lung cancer and non-neoplastic bronchial mucosa as in vitro models representing individual patient. The lung cancer organoids recapitulate the tissue architecture of the primary lung tumours and maintain the genomic alterations of the original tumours during long-term expansion in vitro. The normal bronchial organoids maintain cellular components of normal bronchial mucosa. Lung cancer organoids respond to drugs based on their genomic alterations: a BRCA2-mutant organoid to olaparib, an EGFR-mutant organoid to erlotinib, and an EGFR-mutant/MET-amplified organoid to crizotinib. Considering the short length of time from organoid establishment to drug testing, our newly developed model may prove useful for predicting patient-specific drug responses through in vitro patient-specific drug trials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumour-associated neutrophils in patients with cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/31160735/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role and importance of neutrophils in cancer has become increasingly apparent over the past decade. Neutrophils accumulate in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer, especially in those with advanced-stage disease, and a high circulating neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a robust biomarker of poor clinical outcome in various cancers. To date, most studies investigating the role of neutrophils in cancer have involved animal models or investigated the function of circulating human neutrophils. Thus, only limited information is available on the roles of intratumoural neutrophils (also known as tumour-associated neutrophils (TANs)) in patients with cancer. In this Review, we initially describe the evidence correlating the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with prognosis, followed by a discussion on the predictive value of TANs, which remains debatable, with conflicting data from different cancer types, including variations based on neutrophil location within and/or around the tumour. We then explore available data on the implications of TAN phenotypes and functions for cancer development and progression, highlighting the reported effects of various treatments on TANs and how neutrophils might affect therapeutic efficacy. Finally, we examine the various compounds capable of modulating neutrophils and suggest future research directions that might ultimately enable the manipulation of TANs in patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diverging inflammasome signals in tumorigenesis and potential targeting</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/30842595/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammasomes are molecular platforms that assemble upon sensing various intracellular stimuli. Inflammasome assembly leads to activation of caspase 1, thereby promoting the secretion of bioactive interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 and inducing an inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis. Effectors of the inflammasome efficiently drive an immune response, primarily providing protection against microbial infections and mediating control over sterile insults. However, aberrant inflammasome signalling is associated with pathogenesis of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration and malignancies. Chronic inflammation perpetuated by inflammasome activation plays a central role in all stages of tumorigenesis, including immunosuppression, proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. Conversely, inflammasome signalling also contributes to tumour suppression by maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, which portrays the diverse roles of inflammasomes in tumorigenesis. Studies have underscored the importance of environmental factors, such as diet and gut microbiota, in inflammasome signalling, which in turn influences tumorigenesis. In this Review, we deliver an overview of the interplay between inflammasomes and tumorigenesis and discuss their potential as therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An oncolytic herpesvirus expressing E-cadherin improves survival in mouse models of glioblastoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/30475349/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) is limited by rapid viral clearance by innate immune effector cells and poor intratumoral viral spread. We combine two approaches to overcome these barriers: inhibition of natural killer (NK) cells and enhancement of intratumoral viral spread. We engineered an oHSV to express CDH1, encoding E-cadherin, an adherent molecule and a ligand for KLRG1, an inhibitory receptor expressed on NK cells. In vitro, infection with this engineered virus, named OV-CDH1, induced high surface E-cadherin expression on infected glioblastoma (GBM) cells, which typically lack endogenous E-cadherin. Ectopically expressed E-cadherin enhanced the spread of OV-CDH1 by facilitating cell-to-cell infection and viral entry and reduced viral clearance by selectively protecting OV-CDH1-infected cells from KLRG1+ NK cell killing. In vivo, OV-CDH1 treatment substantially prolonged the survival in GBM-bearing mouse models, primarily because of improved viral spread rather than inhibition of NK cell activity. Thus, virus-induced overexpression of E-cadherin may be a generalizable strategy for improving cancer virotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Homeobox oncogene activation by pan-cancer DNA hypermethylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/30097071/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Cancers have long been recognized to be not only genetically but also epigenetically distinct from their tissues of origin. Although genetic alterations underlying oncogene upregulation have been well studied, to what extent epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, can also induce oncogene expression remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Here, through pan-cancer analysis of 4174 genome-wide profiles, including whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from 30 normal tissues and 35 solid tumors, we discover a strong correlation between gene-body hypermethylation of DNA methylation canyons, defined as broad under-methylated regions, and overexpression of approximately 43% of homeobox genes, many of which are also oncogenes. To gain insights into the cause-and-effect relationship, we use a newly developed dCas9-SunTag-DNMT3A system to methylate genomic sites of interest. The locus-specific hypermethylation of gene-body canyon, but not promoter, of homeobox oncogene DLX1, can directly increase its gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our pan-cancer analysis followed by functional validation reveals DNA hypermethylation as a novel epigenetic mechanism for homeobox oncogene upregulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RNA N6-methyladenosine modification in cancers: current status and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/29686311/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A), the most abundant internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs), has been shown to play critical roles in various normal bioprocesses such as tissue development, stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, heat shock or DNA damage response, and maternal-to-zygotic transition. The m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification is deposited by the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methyltransferase complex (MTC; i.e., writer) composed of METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP, and probably also VIRMA and RBM15, and can be removed by m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A demethylases (i.e., erasers) such as FTO and ALKBH5. The fates of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-modified mRNAs rely on the functions of distinct proteins that recognize them (i.e., readers), which may affect the stability, splicing, and/or translation of target mRNAs. Given the functional importance of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification machinery in normal bioprocesses, it is not surprising that evidence is emerging that dysregulation of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification and the associated proteins also contributes to the initiation, progression, and drug response of cancers. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the study of biological functions and the underlying molecular mechanisms of dysregulated m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification and the associated machinery in the pathogenesis and drug response of various types of cancers. In addition, we also discuss possible therapeutic interventions against the dysregulated m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A machinery to treat cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By exerting pro- and anti-tumorigenic actions, tumor-infiltrating immune cells can profoundly influence tumor progression, as well as the success of anti-cancer therapies. Therefore, the quantification of tumor-infiltrating immune cells holds the promise to unveil the multi-faceted role of the immune system in human cancers and its involvement in tumor escape mechanisms and response to therapy. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can be quantified from RNA sequencing data of human tumors using bioinformatics approaches. In this review, we describe state-of-the-art computational methods for the quantification of immune cells from transcriptomics data and discuss the open challenges that must be addressed to accurately quantify immune infiltrates from RNA sequencing data of human bulk tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though used widely in cancer therapy, paclitaxel only elicits a response in a fraction of patients. A strong determinant of paclitaxel tumor response is the state of microtubule dynamic instability. However, whether the manipulation of this physiological process can be controlled to enhance paclitaxel response has not been tested. Here, we show a previously unrecognized role of the microtubule-associated protein CRMP2 in inducing microtubule bundling through its carboxy terminus. This activity is significantly decreased when the FER tyrosine kinase phosphorylates CRMP2 at Y479 and Y499. The crystal structures of wild-type CRMP2 and CRMP2-Y479E reveal how mimicking phosphorylation prevents tetramerization of CRMP2. Depletion of FER or reducing its catalytic activity using sub-therapeutic doses of inhibitors increases paclitaxel-induced microtubule stability and cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells and in vivo. This work provides a rationale for inhibiting FER-mediated CRMP2 phosphorylation to enhance paclitaxel on-target activity for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human primary liver cancer-derived organoid cultures for disease modeling and drug screening</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human liver cancer research currently lacks in vitro models that can faithfully recapitulate the pathophysiology of the original tumor. We recently described a novel, near-physiological organoid culture system, wherein primary human healthy liver cells form long-term expanding organoids that retain liver tissue function and genetic stability. Here we extend this culture system to the propagation of primary liver cancer (PLC) organoids from three of the most common PLC subtypes: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and combined HCC/CC (CHC) tumors. PLC-derived organoid cultures preserve the histological architecture, gene expression and genomic landscape of the original tumor, allowing for discrimination between different tumor tissues and subtypes, even after long-term expansion in culture in the same medium conditions. Xenograft studies demonstrate that the tumorogenic potential, histological features and metastatic properties of PLC-derived organoids are preserved in vivo. PLC-derived organoids are amenable for biomarker identification and drug-screening testing and led to the identification of the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 as a potential therapeutic agent for primary liver cancer. We thus demonstrate the wide-ranging biomedical utilities of PLC-derived organoid models in furthering the understanding of liver cancer biology and in developing personalized-medicine approaches for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systematic interrogation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is key to the development of immunotherapies and the prediction of their clinical responses in cancers. Here, we perform deep single-cell RNA sequencing on 5,063 single T cells isolated from peripheral blood, tumor, and adjacent normal tissues from six hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The transcriptional profiles of these individual cells, coupled with assembled T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, enable us to identify 11 T cell subsets based on their molecular and functional properties and delineate their developmental trajectory. Specific subsets such as exhausted CD8+ T cells and Tregs are preferentially enriched and potentially clonally expanded in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and we identified signature genes for each subset. One of the genes, layilin, is upregulated on activated CD8+ T cells and Tregs and represses the CD8+ T cell functions in vitro. This compendium of transcriptome data provides valuable insights and a rich resource for understanding the immune landscape in cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metastases account for the great majority of cancer-associated deaths, yet this complex process remains the least understood aspect of cancer biology. As the body of research concerning metastasis continues to grow at a rapid rate, the biological programs that underlie the dissemination and metastatic outgrowth of cancer cells are beginning to come into view. In this review we summarize the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in metastasis, with a focus on carcinomas where the most is known, and we highlight the general principles of metastasis that have begun to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hippo Pathway in Organ Size Control, Tissue Homeostasis, and Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/26544935/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two decades of studies in multiple model organisms have established the Hippo pathway as a key regulator of organ size and tissue homeostasis. By inhibiting YAP and TAZ transcription co-activators, the Hippo pathway regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and stemness in response to a wide range of extracellular and intracellular signals, including cell-cell contact, cell polarity, mechanical cues, ligands of G-protein-coupled receptors, and cellular energy status. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway exerts a significant impact on cancer development. Further investigation of the functions and regulatory mechanisms of this pathway will help uncovering the mystery of organ size control and identify new targets for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular pathways: autophagy in cancer--a matter of timing and context</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/25165101/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is an intracellular self-digestion mechanism, by which cellular components are sorted into double-membrane autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Cells use autophagy to dispose of wastes and eliminate hazards, while recycling nutrients and tuning metabolism in the process. Through these functions, autophagy promotes cell fitness, genome integrity, tissue homeostasis, and cell survival and growth under stress. Both autophagy upregulation and downregulation have been found in human cancers, suggesting a complex role in tumor development. Accumulating results from autophagy-deficient mice and mouse models of human cancers have demonstrated that autophagy generally suppresses tumor initiation, but promotes tumor progression, in a manner that is dependent on timing and context and modified by specific tumorigenic events. Given the role of autophagy in facilitating tumor growth, autophagy inhibition has gained wide attention as a potential anticancer therapy. Here, we summarize relevant genetic, preclinical, and clinical studies and discuss the multifaceted role of autophagy in cancer, as well as the prospects of autophagy inhibition for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting STAT3 in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/32972405/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a point of convergence for numerous oncogenic signaling pathways, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is central in regulating the anti-tumor immune response. STAT3 is broadly hyperactivated both in cancer and non-cancerous cells within the tumor ecosystem and plays important roles in inhibiting the expression of crucial immune activation regulators and promoting the production of immunosuppressive factors. Therefore, targeting the STAT3 signaling pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for numerous cancers. In this review, we outline the importance of STAT3 signaling pathway in tumorigenesis and its immune regulation, and highlight the current status for the development of STAT3-targeting therapeutic approaches. We also summarize and discuss recent advances in STAT3-based combination immunotherapy in detail. These endeavors provide new insights into the translational application of STAT3 in cancer and may contribute to the promotion of more effective treatments toward malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthetic lethal screening identifies compounds activating iron-dependent, nonapoptotic cell death in oncogenic-RAS-harboring cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/18355723/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened small molecules to identify two compounds, which we named RSL3 and RSL5, that have increased lethality in the presence of oncogenic RAS. Counter screening with biologically active compounds defined aspects of the mechanism of action for RSL3 and RSL5, such as a nonapoptotic, MEK-dependent, and iron-dependent oxidative cell death. Erastin, a previously reported compound with RAS-selective lethality, showed similar properties. RNA interference experiments targeting voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (VDAC3), a target of erastin, demonstrated that RSL5 is a scaffold that acts through VDACs to activate the observed pathway. RSL3 activated a similar death mechanism but in a VDAC-independent manner. We found that cells transformed with oncogenic RAS have increased iron content relative to their normal cell counterparts through upregulation of transferrin receptor 1 and downregulation of ferritin heavy chain 1 and ferritin light chain.&lt;/p&gt;
