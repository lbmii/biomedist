      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury is a major cause of death in sepsis. Tofacitinib (TOFA), a JAK inhibitor, has anti-inflammatory activity in autoimmune diseases, but its role in acute lung injury in sepsis remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to establish a septic rat model by cecal ligation and perforation, and to evaluate the effect of tofacitinib on the survival rate of septic rat model and its role in acute lung injury in septic rats and the possible mechanism of action. In this study, TOFA (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg) was used to observe the survival rate of septic rats. It was found that TOFA (10 mg/kg) significantly improved the survival rate of septic rats. We selected TOFA (10 mg/kg) and focused on the protective effect of TOFA on acute lung injury. The results confirmed that TOFA significantly inhibited the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ inflammatory factors, reduced the W/D weight ratio of septic lung tissue, and significantly improved lung histopathological damage. These results may be related to the inhibitory effect of TOFA on JAK-STAT/NF-κ B signaling pathway. In conclusion, for the first time, we found that TOFA has a protective effect against sepsis-induced acute lung injury, and it may be a promising drug for the treatment of acute lung injury in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tmem88 confines ectodermal Wnt2bb signaling in pharyngeal arch artery progenitors for balancing cell cycle progression and cell fate decision</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/23-02-04-21-09/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharyngeal arch artery (PAA) progenitors undergo proliferative expansion and angioblast differentiation to build vessels connecting the heart with the dorsal aortae. However, it remains unclear whether and how these two processes are orchestrated. Here we demonstrate that Tmem88 is required to fine-tune PAA progenitor proliferation and differentiation. Loss of zebrafish &lt;em&gt;tmem88a/b&lt;/em&gt; leads to an excessive expansion and a failure of differentiation of PAA progenitors. Moreover, &lt;em&gt;tmem88a/b&lt;/em&gt; deficiency enhances &lt;em&gt;cyclin D1&lt;/em&gt; expression in PAA progenitors via aberrant Wnt signal activation. Mechanistically, cyclin D1-CDK4/6 promotes progenitor proliferation through accelerating the G1/S transition while suppressing angioblast differentiation by phosphorylating Nkx2.5/Smad3. Ectodermal Wnt2bb signaling is confined by Tmem88 in PAA progenitors to ensure a balance between proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, the proliferation and angioblast differentiation of PAA progenitors manifest an inverse relationship and are delicately regulated by cell cycle machinery downstream of the Tmem88-Wnt pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Notoginsenoside R1 protects against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice via suppressing TAK1-JNK/p38 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36721009/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies show that notoginsenoside R1 (NG-R1), a novel saponin isolated from Panax notoginseng, protects kidney, intestine, lung, brain and heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury. In this study we investigated the cardioprotective mechanisms of NG-R1 in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury in vivo and in vitro. MI/R injury was induced in mice by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by 4 h reperfusion. The mice were treated with NG-R1 (25 mg/kg, i.p.) every 2 h for 3 times starting 30 min prior to ischemic surgery. We showed that NG-R1 administration significantly decreased the myocardial infarction area, alleviated myocardial cell damage and improved cardiac function in MI/R mice. In murine neonatal cardiomyocytes (CMs) subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro, pretreatment with NG-R1 (25 μM) significantly inhibited apoptosis. We revealed that NG-R1 suppressed the phosphorylation of transforming growth factor β-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1), JNK and p38 in vivo and in vitro. Pretreatment with JNK agonist anisomycin or p38 agonist P79350 partially abolished the protective effects of NG-R1 in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of TAK1 greatly ameliorated H/R-induced apoptosis of CMs, and NG-R1 pretreatment did not provide further protection in TAK1-silenced CMs under H/R injury. Overexpression of TAK1 abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of NG-R1 and diminished the inhibition of NG-R1 on JNK/p38 signaling in MI/R mice as well as in H/R-treated CMs. Collectively, NG-R1 alleviates MI/R injury by suppressing the activity of TAK1, subsequently inhibiting JNK/p38 signaling and attenuating cardiomyocyte apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schwann cell-derived exosomes containing MFG-E8 modify macrophage/microglial polarization for attenuating inflammation via the SOCS3/STAT3 pathway after spinal cord injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36717543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophage/microglia polarization acts as an important part in regulating inflammatory responses in spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the regulation of inflammation of Schwann cell-derived exosomes (SCDEs) for SCI repair is still unclear. Therefore, we intend to find out the effect of SCDEs on regulating the inflammation related to macrophage polarization during the recovery of SCI. Firstly, the thesis demonstrated that SCDEs could attenuate the LPS- inflammation in BMDMs by suppressing M1 polarization and stimulating M2 polarization. Similarly, SCDEs improved functional recovery of female Wistar rats of the SCI contusion model according to BBB (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan) score, electrophysiological assay, and the gait analysis system of CatWalk XT. Moreover, MFG-E8 was verified as the main component of SCDEs to improve the inflammatory response by proteomic sequencing and lentiviral transfection. Improvement of the inflammatory microenvironment also inhibited neuronal apoptosis. The knockout of MFG-E8 in SCs can reverse the anti-inflammatory effects of SCDEs treatment. The SOCS3/STAT3 signaling pathway was identified to participate in upregulating M2 polarization induced by MFG-E8. In conclusion, our findings will enrich the mechanism of SCDEs in repairing SCI and provide potential applications and new insights for the clinical translation of SCDEs treatment for SCI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vimentin affects inflammation and neutrophil recruitment in airway epithelium during Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36717839/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) frequently colonizes the swine upper respiratory tract and can cause Streptococcal disease in swine with clinical manifestations of pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia. Previously, we have shown that vimentin, a kind of intermediate filament protein, is involved in the penetration of SS2 through the tracheal epithelial barrier. The initiation of invasive disease is closely related to SS2-induced excessive local inflammation; however, the role of vimentin in airway epithelial inflammation remains unclear. Here, we show that vimentin deficient mice exhibit attenuated lung injury, diminished production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and the IL-8 homolog, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), and substantially reduced neutrophils in the lungs following intranasal infection with SS2. We also found that swine tracheal epithelial cells (STEC) without vimentin show decreased transcription of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8. SS2 infection caused reassembly of vimentin in STEC, and pharmacological disruption of vimentin filaments prevented the transcription of those proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, deficiency of vimentin failed to increase the transcription of nucleotide oligomerization domain protein 2 (NOD2), which is known to interact with vimentin, and the phosphorylation of NF-κB protein p65. This study provides insights into how vimentin promotes excessive airway inflammation, thereby exacerbating airway injury and SS2-induced systemic infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kirenol inhibits inflammation challenged by lipopolysaccharide through the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 autophagy pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36706589/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirenol is a bioactive substance isolated from &lt;em&gt;Herba Siegesbeckiae&lt;/em&gt;. Although the anti-inflammatory activity of kirenol has been well documented, its role in autophagy remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the protective role of kirenol on inflammation challenged by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in acute lung injury (ALI) cell and mouse models and unravel the underlying mechanisms, with a particular focus on autophagy. For this purpose, an ALI cell and mouse models were established, and the effects of kirenol on the expression of molecules related to inflammation and autophagy were examined. The present results revealed that kirenol could significantly inhibit inflammatory cytokines secretion in cells and in the mice injured by LPS; this effect may be attributed to enhanced autophagy as evidenced by the up-regulation of LC3-II and the down-regulation of p62 both in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylated AMPK and ULK1 increased, while phosphorylated mTOR decreased in the kirenol-treated ALI cell model. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy using AMPK inhibitor or 3-MA or chloroquine (CQ) reversed the anti-inflammatory and autophagy-enhancement effects of kirenol exposure in vitro, indicating that kirenol could enhance autophagy by activating the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 pathway. The results of RNA sequencing suggested that kirenol was strongly related to the biological functions of acute inflammatory response and the AMPK signaling pathway. Further in vivo ALI mouse model studies demonstrated the protective role of kirenol against lung inflammation, such as improved histopathology, decreased lung edema, and leukocyte infiltration were abolished by 3-MA. These findings implicate that kirenol can inhibit LPS-induced inflammation via the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 autophagy pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;PQ poisoning can induce acute lung injury and fibrosis without effective treatment methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TwHF possessed potential properties in therapies for PQ-induced lung injury and fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protective effect of TwHF may be due to the regulation of oxidative stress and ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paraquat (PQ) poisoning can induce acute lung injury and fibrosis and has an extremely high mortality rate. However, no effective treatments for PQ poisoning have been established. In this study, the potential efficacy of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f. (TwHF) in alleviating PQ-induced lung injury and fibrosis was investigated in a mouse model. Mice were randomly assigned to the control, PQ, PQ + TwHF1 (pretreatment before inducing poisoning), and PQ + TwHF2 (treatment after poisoning) groups. The mice in the PQ + TwHF1 group were pretreated with TwHF for 5 days before receiving one dose of PQ (120 mg/kg) and then received a daily oral gavage of the indicated dosages of TwHF until sacrifice. The mice in the PQ + TwHF2 group were treated with TwHF 2 h after PQ exposure until sacrifice. The pathological analysis and Fapi PET/CT showed that treatment with TwHF attenuated lung injury. And TwHF reduced pulmonary oxidative stress, as indicated by the reduction in, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, as well as by the increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Accordingly, the Perls DAB staining showed increased iron concentrations and western blotting revealed a decreased GPX4 expression after PQ exposure, as well as the mitigation of the overexpression of Nrf2 and HO-1 induced by PQ. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the potential of TwHF as a treatment for PQ-induced lung injury and fibrosis. The protective mechanism of this medicinal herb may involve the regulation of ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cytosolic DNA sensing by cGAS/STING promotes TRPV2-mediated Ca2&#43; release to protect stressed replication forks</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36696898/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replication stress induces TRPV2-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from the ER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STING binds to and represses TRPV2 on the ER in the absence of replication stress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cytosolic self-DNA-induced cGAMP promotes STING dissociation from TRPV2 and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oncogene-induced replication stress also activates the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent fork protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protection of DNA replication forks under stress is essential for genome maintenance and cancer suppression. One mechanism of fork protection involves an elevation in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), which in turn activates CaMKK2 and AMPK to prevent uncontrolled fork processing by Exo1. How replication stress triggers [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; elevation is unclear. Here, we report a role of cytosolic self-DNA (cytosDNA) and the ion channel TRPV2 in [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; induction and fork protection. Replication stress leads to the generation of ssDNA and dsDNA species that, upon translocation into cytoplasm, trigger the activation of the sensor protein cGAS and the production of cGAMP. The subsequent binding of cGAMP to STING causes its dissociation from TRPV2, leading to TRPV2 derepression and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from the ER, which in turn activates the downstream signaling cascade to prevent fork degradation. This Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent genome protection pathway is also activated in response to replication stress caused by oncogene activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAPK/JNK signaling is pivotal in carcinogenesis. However, ubiquitin-mediated homeostasis of JNK remains to be verified. Here, with results from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and luciferase reporter pathway identification, we show that USP14 orchestrates MAPK/JNK signaling and identify USP14 as a deubiquitinase that interacts and stabilizes JNK. USP14 is elevated in colorectal cancer patients and is positively associated with JNK protein and downstream gene expression. USP14 ablation reduces cancer cell proliferation in vitro and colorectal tumorigenesis in vivo by downregulating MAPK/JNK pathway activation. Moreover, USP14 expression is induced by TNF-α, forming a feedback loop with JNK and leading to tumor amplification. Our study suggests that elevated expression of USP14 promotes MAPK/JNK signaling by stabilizing JNK, which in turn augments colorectal carcinogenesis, indicating a potential therapeutic target for colorectal cancer patients with increased USP14 expression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular differences of angiogenic versus vessel co-opting colorectal cancer liver metastases at single-cell resolution</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36691028/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) are associated with a poor prognosis, reflected by a five-year survival rate of 14%. Anti-angiogenic therapy through anti-VEGF antibody administration is one of the limited therapies available. However, only a subgroup of metastases uses sprouting angiogenesis to secure their nutrients and oxygen supply, while others rely on vessel co-option (VCO). The distinct mode of vascularization is reflected by specific histopathological growth patterns (HGPs), which have proven prognostic and predictive significance. Nevertheless, their molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We evaluated CRCLM from 225 patients regarding their HGP and clinical data. Moreover, we performed spatial (21,804 spots) and single-cell (22,419 cells) RNA sequencing analyses to explore molecular differences in detail, further validated in vitro through immunohistochemical analysis and patient-derived organoid cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We detected specific metabolic alterations and a signature of WNT signalling activation in metastatic cancer cells related to the VCO phenotype. Importantly, in the corresponding healthy liver of CRCLM displaying sprouting angiogenesis, we identified a predominantly expressed capillary subtype of endothelial cells, which could be further explored as a possible predictor for HGP relying on sprouting angiogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These findings may prove to be novel therapeutic targets to the treatment of CRCLM, in special the ones relying on VCO.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD-NTase family member MB21D2 promotes cGAS-mediated antiviral and antitumor immunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) family members are immune sensors that synthesize diverse nucleotide signals to initiate antiviral response in bacteria and animals. As a founding member of CD-NTase enzyme, cGAS has been identified as a key sensor for cytoplasmic DNA and type I interferons (IFNs) signaling in metazoan. However, the functions of other metazoan CD-NTases remain enigmatic. Here, we showed that Mab-21 domain-containing protein 2 (MB21D2), another member of the CD-NTase family, plays a positive role in modulating the cGAS-STING signaling in myeloid cells. Deficiency of MB21D2 in THP-1 cells or mice macrophages led to impaired production of type I interferon upon DNA stimulation. Consistently, &lt;em&gt;Mb21d2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice showed more susceptible to infection with DNA virus and faster growth of melanoma, compared to its counterparts. Mechanistically, MB21D2 specially bound with the N-terminal of cGAS, facilitated its liquid phase condensation and DNA-binding activity, leading to the enhanced production of cGAMP and subsequent IFN-β production. Thus, our findings unveiled that the CD-NTase family member MB21D2 contributes to host antiviral and antitumor responses by enhancing cGAS activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Formyl peptide receptor 2 activation by mitochondrial formyl peptides stimulates the neutrophil proinflammatory response via the ERK pathway and exacerbates ischemia-reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36658472/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an inevitable process in renal transplantation that significantly increases the risk of delayed graft function, acute rejection, and even graft loss. Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) is an important receptor in multiple septic and aseptic injuries, but its functions in kidney IRI are still unclear. This study was designed to reveal the pathological role of FPR2 in kidney IRI and its functional mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To explore the mechanism of FPR2 in kidney IRI, the model rats were sacrificed after IRI surgery. Immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and western blotting were used to detect differences in the expression of FPR2 and its ligands between the IRI and control groups. WRW4 (WRWWWW-NH2), a specific antagonist of FPR2, was administered to kidney IRI rats. Kidney function and pathological damage were detected to assess kidney injury and recovery. Flow cytometry was used to quantitatively compare neutrophil infiltration among the experimental groups. Mitochondrial formyl peptides (mtFPs) were synthesized and administered to primary rat neutrophils together with the specific FPR family antagonist WRW4 to verify our hypothesis in vitro. Western blotting and cell function assays were used to examine the functions and signaling pathways that FPR2 mediates in neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; FPR2 was activated mainly by mtFPs during the acute phase of IRI, mediating neutrophil migration and reactive oxygen species production in the rat kidney through the ERK1/2 pathway. FPR2 blockade in the early phase protected rat kidneys from IRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; mtFPs activated FPR2 during the acute phase of IRI and mediated rat kidney injury by activating the migration and reactive oxygen species generation of neutrophils through the ERK1/2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scavenger receptor BI attenuates oxidized phospholipid-induced pulmonary inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36681128/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36681128/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These studies demonstrate that scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) limits the lung pathology and inflammation following the generation of the danger associated molecular pattern oxidized phospholipids (oxPL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These findings indicate that if SR-BI is dysfunctional, there is a lack of oxPL clearance, dysfunctional lipid metabolism, and increased toll-like receptor 4 signaling in the lung leading to increased lung pathologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules released from dead/dying cells following toxicant and/or environmental exposures that activate the immune response through binding pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Excessive production of DAMPs or failed clearance leads to chronic inflammation and delayed inflammation resolution. One category of DAMPs are oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs) produced upon exposure to high levels of oxidative stress, such as following ozone (O3)- induced inflammation. OxPLs are bound by multiple classes of PRRs that include scavenger receptors (SRs) such as SR class B-1 (SR-BI) and toll-like receptors (TLRs). Interactions between oxPLs and PRRs appear to regulate inflammation; however, the role of SR-BI in oxPL-induced lung inflammation has not been defined. Therefore, we hypothesize that SR-BI is critical in protecting the lung from oxPL-induced pulmonary inflammation/injury. To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6 J (WT) female mice were dosed with oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (oxPAPC) by oropharyngeal aspiration and identified increased pulmonary SR-BI expression. Following oxPAPC exposure, SR-BI deficient (SR-BI&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) mice exhibited increased lung pathology and inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production. Lipidomic analysis revealed that SR-BI&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had an altered pulmonary lipidome prior to and following oxPAPC exposure, which correlated with increased oxidized phosphatidylcholines (PCs). Finally, we characterized TLR4-mediated activation of NF-κB following oxPAPC exposure and discovered that SR-BI&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased TLR4 mRNA expression in lung tissue and macrophages, increased nuclear p65, and decreased cytoplasmic IκBα. Overall, we conclude that SR-BI is required for limiting oxPAPC-induced lung pathology by maintaining lipid homeostasis, reducing oxidized PCs, and attenuating TLR4-NF-κB activation thereby preventing excessive and persistent inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Type I interferon/STAT1 signaling regulates UBE2M-mediated antiviral innate immunity in a negative feedback manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36662617/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UBE2M inhibits STUB1-mediated RIG-I degradation to resist RNA virus infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-I/STAT1 negatively regulates UBE2M-induced antiviral immunity via TRIM21&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mEVs/TRIM21-ΔRING are promising antiviral reagents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling is central to inducing antiviral innate immunity. However, the mechanisms for IFN-I signaling self-regulation are still largely unknown. Here, we report that RNA virus-infected macrophages with UBE2M deficiency produced decreased IFN-I expression in a RIG-I-dependent manner, causing an aggravated viral infection. Mechanistically, UBE2M inhibits RIG-I degradation by preventing the interaction of RIG-I and E3 ligase STUB1, resulting in antiviral IFN-I signaling activation. Simultaneously, IFN-I signaling-activated STAT1 facilitates the transcription of &lt;em&gt;Trim21&lt;/em&gt;, leading to increased UBE2M degradation and blunted antiviral immunity. Translationally, oral administration of milk-derived extracellular vesicles containing RING domain-truncated TRIM21 (TRIM21-ΔRING) lacking E3 ligase activity efficiently transfers TRIM21-ΔRING into macrophages. TRIM21-ΔRING suppresses UBE2M degradation by competitively binding to UBE2M with TRIM21, thereby enhancing antiviral immunity. Overall, we reveal a negative feedback loop of IFN-I signaling and develop a reagent to improve innate immunity against RNA viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>p53 engages the cGAS/STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway for tumor suppression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36638783/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wild-type p53 (WTp53) activates the cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS/STING pathway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTp53 requires TRIM24 to promote TREX1 degradation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TREX1 degradation causes cytosolic DNA accumulation and activation of cGAS/STING&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of cGAS or STING compromises WTp53’s tumor suppressor activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor suppression by TP53 involves cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. TP53 can suppress tumor growth by modulating immune system functions; however, the mechanistic basis for this activity is not well understood. We report that p53 promotes the degradation of the DNA exonuclease TREX1, resulting in cytosolic dsDNA accumulation. We demonstrate that p53 requires the ubiquitin ligase TRIM24 to induce TREX1 degradation. The cytosolic DNA accumulation resulting from TREX1 degradation activates the cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS/STING pathway, resulting in induction of type I interferons. TREX1 overexpression sufficed to block p53 activation of the cGAS/STING pathway. p53-mediated induction of type I interferon (IFNB1) is suppressed by cGAS/STING knockout, and p53&amp;rsquo;s tumor suppressor activities are compromised by the loss of signaling through the cGAS/STING pathway. Thus, our study reveals that p53 utilizes the cGAS/STING innate immune system pathway for both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic tumor suppressor activities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exposure to polystyrene microplastics triggers lung injury via targeting toll-like receptor 2 and activation of the NF-κB signal in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36641069/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are ubiquitous pollutants with a wide range of plastic applications. More recently, microplastics are in the air and can be inhaled into the lungs, causing respiratory diseases. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms by which microplastics may induce respiratory disease is still limited. This study used intranasal instillation to develop a model of lung injury. The histopathology result showed that the mouse lung had severe inflammatory responses, apoptosis and collagen deposition with chronic exposure to different sizes (Small: 1–5 μm and Large: 10–20 μm) of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPS), and the damage of smaller sizes was obvious. The expression levels of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) family, evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors, were detected, and the levels of TLR2 mRNA was significantly increased. In transfection experiments, PS-MPS increased the inflammatory response in HEK293 cells with TLR2 expression. Furthermore, exposure to small polystyrene microplastics promoted oxidative stress and apoptosis, and accelerated the process of fibrosis. Interestingly, inhibition of the NF-κB signal relieves inflammation and oxidative stress, reduces apoptosis, and thus controls the fibrosis process. These results suggested that PS-MPS targeted binding to TLR2 and further exacerbated fibrosis by facilitating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis with the activation of NF-κB signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B inhibits the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B prevents the production of ROS and reduced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a devastating respiratory disorder characterized by rapid alveolar injury, uncontrolled inflammatory response, etc. Onychiol B is a cyathane diterpene originally isolated from fern plants. In this study, onychiol B can inhibit the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as NO, iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells by restraining the NF-κB and the p38 MAPK pathway. In addition, it prevents the production of ROS and reduces the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, in the acute lung injury mouse model induced by LPS injected into the trachea, onychiol B alleviates pulmonary edema, reverses inflammatory mediator TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-β secretion in lung. In general, our data show that significant anti-ALI effects of onychiol B would render it a potential candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oxidative stress-triggered Wnt signaling perturbation characterizes the tipping point of lung adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36627278/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lkb1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency confers the Kras-mutant lung cancer with strong plasticity and the potential for adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation (AST). However, it remains largely unknown how &lt;em&gt;Lkb1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency dynamically regulates AST. Using the classical AST mouse model (&lt;em&gt;Kras&lt;sup&gt;LSL-G12D/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Lkb1&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, KL), we here comprehensively analyze the temporal transcriptomic dynamics of lung tumors at different stages by dynamic network biomarker (DNB) and identify the tipping point at which the Wnt signaling is abruptly suppressed by the excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through its downstream effector FOXO3A. Bidirectional genetic perturbation of the Wnt pathway using two different &lt;em&gt;Ctnnb1&lt;/em&gt; conditional knockout mouse strains confirms its essential role in the negative regulation of AST. Importantly, pharmacological activation of the Wnt pathway before but not after the tipping point inhibits squamous transdifferentiation, highlighting the irreversibility of AST after crossing the tipping point. Through comparative transcriptomic analyses of mouse and human tumors, we find that the lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma form a &amp;ldquo;Yin-Yang&amp;rdquo; counteracting network. Interestingly, inactivation of the Wnt pathway preferentially suppresses the adenomatous lineage TF network and thus disrupts the &amp;ldquo;Yin-Yang&amp;rdquo; homeostasis to lean towards the squamous lineage, whereas ectopic expression of NKX2-1, an adenomatous lineage TF, significantly dampens such phenotypic transition accelerated by the Wnt pathway inactivation. The negative correlation between the Wnt pathway and AST is further observed in a large cohort of human lung adenosquamous carcinoma. Collectively, our study identifies the tipping point of AST and highlights an essential role of the ROS-Wnt axis in dynamically orchestrating the homeostasis between adeno- and squamous-specific TF networks at the AST tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myofibroblast-Specific Inhibition of the Rho Kinase-MRTF-SRF Pathway Using Nanotechnology for the Prevention of Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36625494/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of myofibroblasts in the lung and progressive tissue scarring. Fibroblasts exist across a spectrum of states, from quiescence in health to activated myofibroblasts in the setting of injury. Highly activated myofibroblasts have a critical role in the establishment of fibrosis as the predominant source of type 1 collagen and pro-fibrotic mediators. Myofibroblasts are also highly contractile cells and can alter lung biomechanical properties through tissue contraction. . One of the ways myofibroblast activation occurs is through activation of the Rho/myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) / serum response factor (SRF) pathway, which signals through intracellular actin polymerization. However, concerns surrounding the pleiotropic and ubiquitous nature of these signaling pathways have limited the translation of inhibitory drugs. Herein, we demonstrate a novel therapeutic anti-fibrotic strategy utilizing myofibroblast-targeted nanoparticles containing a MTRF/SRF pathway inhibitor (CCG-1423) which has been shown to block myofibroblast activation in vitro. Myofibroblasts were preferentially targeted via the angiotensin 2 receptor, which has been shown to be selectively upregulated in animal and human studies. These nanoparticles were non-toxic and accumulated in lung myofibroblasts in the bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, reducing the number of these activated cells and their production of pro-fibrotic mediators. Ultimately, in a murine model of lung fibrosis, a single injection of these drug containing targeted nanoagents reduced fibrosis as compared to control mice. This approach has the potential to deliver personalized therapy by precisely targeting signaling pathways in a cell-specific manner, allowing increased efficacy with reduced deleterious off-target effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell transcriptomics reveals a mechanosensitive injury signaling pathway in early diabetic nephropathy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36627643/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, and histopathologic glomerular lesions are among the earliest structural alterations of DN. However, the signaling pathways that initiate these glomerular alterations are incompletely understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To delineate the cellular and molecular basis for DN initiation, we performed single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing of renal cells from type 2 diabetes mice (BTBR ob/ob) at the early stage of DN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed glucose-independent responses in glomerular cell types. The gene regulatory network upstream of glomerular cell programs suggested the activation of mechanosensitive transcriptional pathway MRTF-SRF predominantly taking place in mesangial cells. Importantly, activation of MRTF-SRF transcriptional pathway was also identified in DN glomeruli in independent patient cohort datasets. Furthermore, ex vivo kidney perfusion suggested that the regulation of MRTF-SRF is a common mechanism in response to glomerular hyperfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Overall, our study presents a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of early DN, highlighting mechanosensitive signaling pathways as novel targets of diabetic glomerulopathy.Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of innate immune cGAS-STING pathway contributes to Alzheimer’s pathogenesis in 5×FAD mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cGAS senses microbial and host-derived double-stranded DNA in cytoplasm to trigger cellular innate immune response in a STING-dependent manner; however, it remains unknown whether the cGAS-STING pathway in innate immunity contributes to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here we demonstrated the detectable binding of the cGAS double-stranded DNA in cytoplasm and the activation of the microglial cGAS-STING pathway in brains of human AD and aged mice. &lt;em&gt;Cgas&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; 5×FAD mice were largely protected from cognitive impairment, amyloid-β pathology, neuroinflammation and other sequelae associated with AD. Furthermore, &lt;em&gt;Cgas&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in microglia inhibited a neurotoxic A1 astrocytic phenotype and thus alleviated oligomeric amyloid-β peptide-induced neurotoxicity. Finally, administration of STING inhibitor H-151 potently suppressed the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and ameliorated AD pathogenesis in 5×FAD mice. In conclusion, our present study has identified a critical molecular link between innate immunity and AD and suggests that therapeutic targeting of the cGAS-STING pathway activity might effectively interfere with the progression of AD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Endothelial cell-derived exosomes boost and maintain repair-related phenotypes of Schwann cells via miR199-5p to promote nerve regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36624511/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36624511/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Schwann cells (SCs) respond to nerve injury by transforming into the repair-related cell phenotype, which can provide the essential signals and spatial cues to promote axonal regeneration and induce target reinnervation. Endothelial cells (ECs) contribute to intraneural angiogenesis contributing to creating a permissive microenvironment. The coordination between ECs and SCs within injury sites is crucial in the regeneration process, however, it still unclear. As the intercellular vital information mediators in the nervous system, exosomes have been proposed to take a significant role in regulating regeneration. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to determine the facilitative effect of ECs-derived exosomes on SCs and to seek the underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In the present study, we collected exosomes from media of ECs. We demonstrated that exosomes derived from ECs possessed the favorable neuronal affinity both in vitro and in vivo. Further research indicated that EC-exosomes (EC-EXO) could boost and maintain repair-related phenotypes of SCs, thereby enhancing axonal regeneration, myelination of regenerated axons and neurologically functional recovery of the injured nerve. MiRNA sequencing in EXO-treated SCs and control SCs indicated that EC-EXO significantly up-regulated expression of miR199-5p. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that EC-EXO drove the conversion of SC phenotypes in a PI3K/AKT/PTEN-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In conclusion, our research indicates that the internalization of EC-EXO in SCs can promote nerve regeneration by boosting and maintaining the repair-related phenotypes of SCs. And the mechanism may be relevant to the up-regulated expression of miR199-5p and activation of PI3K/AKT/PTEN signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Promote Metastases of Colorectal Cancers through Activation of ERK Signaling by Releasing Neutrophil Elastase</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36674635/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play important roles in host immunity, as there is increasing evidence of their contribution to the progression of several types of cancers even though their role in colorectal cancers (CRCs) remains unclear. To investigate the clinical relevance of NETs in CRCs, we examined the expression of citrullinated histone H3 using immunohistochemistry and preoperative serum myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes in CRC patients using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High expression of intratumoral or systemic NETs was found to correlate with poor relapse-free survival (RFS), for which it is an independent prognostic factor. In vitro investigations of CRC cells (HCT116, HT29) revealed that NETs did not affect their proliferation but did promote the migration of CRC cells mediated by neutrophil elastase (NE) released during NETosis to increase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. In vivo experiments using nude mice (KSN/slc) revealed that NE inhibition suppressed liver metastases in CRC cells, although it did not affect the growth of subcutaneously implanted tumors. Taken together, these results suggest that NET formation correlates with poor prognoses of patients with CRC and that the inhibition of NE could be a potential therapy for CRC metastases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A DLG1-ARHGAP31-CDC42 axis is essential for the intestinal stem cell response to fluctuating niche Wnt signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36640764/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polarity of the mammalian intestinal epithelium is independent of &lt;em&gt;Dlg1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of &lt;em&gt;Dlg1&lt;/em&gt; in ISCs results in cell death under high Wnt conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISCs lacking &lt;em&gt;Dlg1&lt;/em&gt; have impaired cell division and migration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canonical WNT ligands activate non-canonical Wnt signaling via DLG1-ARHGAP31-CDC42&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central factor in the maintenance of tissue integrity is the response of stem cells to variations in the levels of niche signals. In the gut, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) depend on Wnt ligands for self-renewal and proliferation. Transient increases in Wnt signaling promote regeneration after injury or in inflammatory bowel diseases, whereas constitutive activation of this pathway leads to colorectal cancer. Here, we report that Discs large 1 (&lt;em&gt;Dlg1&lt;/em&gt;), although dispensable for polarity and cellular turnover during intestinal homeostasis, is required for ISC survival in the context of increased Wnt signaling. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and genetic mouse models demonstrated that DLG1 regulates the cellular response to increased canonical Wnt ligands. This occurs via the transcriptional regulation of &lt;em&gt;Arhgap31&lt;/em&gt;, a GTPase-activating protein that deactivates CDC42, an effector of the non-canonical Wnt pathway. These findings reveal a DLG1-ARHGAP31-CDC42 axis that is essential for the ISC response to increased niche Wnt signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Commensal microbiome promotes hair follicle regeneration by inducing keratinocyte HIF-1α signaling and glutamine metabolism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue injury induces metabolic changes in stem cells, which likely modulate regeneration. Using a model of organ regeneration called wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN), we identified skin-resident bacteria as key modulators of keratinocyte metabolism, demonstrating a positive correlation between bacterial load, glutamine metabolism, and regeneration. Specifically, through comprehensive multiomic analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing in murine skin, we show that bacterially induced hypoxia drives increased glutamine metabolism in keratinocytes with attendant enhancement of skin and hair follicle regeneration. In human skin wounds, topical broad-spectrum antibiotics inhibit glutamine production and are partially responsible for reduced healing. These findings reveal a conserved and coherent physiologic context in which bacterially induced metabolic changes improve the tolerance of stem cells to damage and enhance regenerative capacity. This unexpected proregenerative modulation of metabolism by the skin microbiome in both mice and humans suggests important methods for enhancing regeneration after injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HERC3 promotes YAP/TAZ stability and tumorigenesis independently of its ubiquitin ligase activity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36598329/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YAP/TAZ transcriptional co-activators play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis. In the Hippo pathway, diverse signals activate the MST-LATS kinase cascade that leads to YAP/TAZ phosphorylation, and subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by SCFβ-TrCP. When the MST-LATS kinase cascade is inactive, unphosphorylated or dephosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocate into the nucleus to mediate TEAD-dependent gene transcription. Hippo signaling-independent YAP/TAZ activation in human malignancies has also been observed, yet the mechanism remains largely elusive. Here, we report that the ubiquitin E3 ligase HERC3 can promote YAP/TAZ activation independently of its enzymatic activity. HERC3 directly binds to β-TrCP, blocks its interaction with YAP/TAZ, and thus prevents YAP/TAZ ubiquitination and degradation. Expression levels of HERC3 correlate with YAP/TAZ protein levels and expression of YAP/TAZ target genes in breast tumor cells and tissues. Accordingly, knockdown of HERC3 expression ameliorates tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells. Our results establish HERC3 as a critical regulator of the YAP/TAZ stability and a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TRIM27 maintains gut homeostasis by promoting intestinal stem cell self-renewal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of gut homeostasis is associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder affecting approximately 11.2% of the global population. The poorly understood pathogenesis of IBS has impeded its treatment. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing 27 (TRIM27) is weakly expressed in IBS but highly expressed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a frequent chronic organic gastrointestinal disorder. Accordingly, knockout of &lt;em&gt;Trim27&lt;/em&gt; in mice causes spontaneously occurring IBS-like symptoms, including increased visceral hyperalgesia and abnormal stool features, as observed in IBS patients. Mechanistically, TRIM27 stabilizes β-catenin and thus activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote intestinal stem cell (ISC) self-renewal. Consistent with these findings, &lt;em&gt;Trim27&lt;/em&gt; deficiency disrupts organoid formation, which is rescued by reintroducing TRIM27 or β-catenin. Furthermore, Wnt/β-catenin signaling activator treatment ameliorates IBS symptoms by promoting ISC self-renewal. Taken together, these data indicate that TRIM27 is critical for maintaining gut homeostasis, suggesting that targeting the TRIM27/Wnt/β-catenin axis could be a potential treatment strategy for IBS. Our study also indicates that TRIM27 might serve as a potential biomarker for differentiating IBS from IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Delay Diabetic Wound Healing by Inducing Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition via the Hippo pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36594092/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are among the most frequent complications of diabetes with significant morbidity and mortality. Diabetes can trigger neutrophils to undergo histone citrullination by protein arginine deiminase 4 (encoded by Padi4 in mice) and release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The specific mechanism of NETs-mediated wound healing impairment in diabetes remains unknown. In this study, we show neutrophils are more susceptible to NETosis in diabetic wound environments. Via in vitro experiments and in vivo models of wound healing using wide-type and Padi4 -/- mice, we demonstrate NETs can induce the activation of PAK2 via the membrane receptor TLR-9. Then PAK2 phosphorylates the intracellular protein Merlin/NF2 to inhibit the Hippo-YAP pathway. YAP binds to transcription factor SMAD2 and translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to promote endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which ultimately impedes angiogenesis and delays wound healing. Suppression of the Merlin/YAP/SMAD2 pathway can attenuate NET-induced EndMT. Inhibition of NETosis accelerates wound healing by reducing EndMT and promoting angiogenesis. Cumulatively, these data suggest NETosis delays diabetic wound healing by inducing EndMT via the Hippo-YAP pathway. Increased understanding of the molecular mechanism that regulates NETosis and EndMT will be of considerable value for providing cellular targets amenable to therapeutic intervention for DFUs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lycopene Attenuates Di(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate-Induced Mitochondrial Damage and Inflammation in Kidney via cGAS-STING Signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36583613/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a highly harmful and persistent environmental pollutant. Due to its unique chemical composition, it frequently dissolves and enters the environment to endanger human and animal health. Lycopene is a natural bioactive component that can potentially reduce the risk of environmental factor-induced chronic diseases. The present study sought to explore the role and underlying mechanism of lycopene (LYC) on DEHP-induced renal inflammatory response and apoptosis. In this study, mice were orally treated with LYC (5 mg/kg BW/day) and/or DEHP (500 or 1000 mg/kg BW/day) for 28 days. Our results indicated that LYC prevented DEHP-induced histopathological alterations and ultrastructural injuries, including decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), PINK1/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy, and mitochondrial energetic deficit. When damaged mitochondria release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into cytosol, LYC can alleviate inflammation and apoptosis caused by DEHP exposure by activating the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS-STING) signal pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrate that LYC can reduce mitophagy caused by DEHP exposure by activating the PINK1/Parkin pathway and then reduce renal inflammation and apoptosis through the cGAS-STING pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of oleocanthal (OC) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in chickens and its possible mechanisms. In total, 20 chickens were randomly divided into 4 groups: control (CON) group, LPS group, LPS + OC group, and OC group. LPS + OC and OC groups were intragastrically administered a 5 mg/kg·d OC dose for 7 d. On d 8, the LPS group and LPS + OC group were intratracheally administered 2 mg/kg LPS for 12 h. It was found that OC ameliorated the pathological morphology and significantly suppressed apoptosis after OC treatment in LPS-induced ALI chicken (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Antioxidant capacity was higher in the LPS + OC group compared with the LPS group (P &amp;lt; 0.01). OC downregulated the related genes and proteins expression of toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-κB (TLR4/NF-κB) pathway in LPS group (P &amp;lt; 0.01). In conclusion, OC supplementation can alleviate LPS-induced ALI in chickens by suppressing apoptosis, enhancing lung antioxidant capacities and inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. alleviate LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. protect mice by reducing pulmonary edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. inhibit the influx of inflammatory cells into the lung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. reduce inflammation in the lung by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common respiratory disease in clinics, which is characterized by alveolar-capillary membrane loss, plasma protein leakage, pulmonary edema, massive neutrophil infiltration, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators. Rhodiola rosea L. an adaptogenic plant rich in phenylethanoloids, phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. We hope to verify the relieving effect of total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. (RTG) on ALI in mice and clarify its mechanism through this study. In this study, we identified the effect and mechanism of RTG on ALI through LPS-induced ALI mice. After RTG treatment, the pathological structure of lung tissue in ALI mice induced by LPS was significantly improved, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells was reduced. In addition, RTG reduced the production of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the serum of ALI mice and reduced the content or activity of MPO, T-SOD, GSH, and MDA in lung tissue. RNAseq analysis showed that RTG ameliorated LPS-induced ALI through anti-inflammatory, reduced immune response, and anti-apoptotic activities. The western blotting analysis confirmed that RTG could down-regulate the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB p65, and p-IκBα/IκBα. These results suggest that RTG can attenuate LPS-induced ALI through antioxidants and inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular histone H3 facilitates ferroptosis in sepsis through ROS/JNK pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36705411/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Previous evidence realized the critical role of histone in disease control. The anti-inflammatory function of estradiol (E2) in sepsis has been documented. We here intended to unveil the role of extracellular histone H3 in sepsis regarding cell ferroptosis and the role of E2 in a such mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Clinical sample, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced animal models and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced cell models were prepared for testing relative expression of extracellular histone H3 and E2 as well as analyzing the role of extracellular histone H3 and E2 in sepsis concerning cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Under sepsis, we found increased ferroptosis and extracellular histone H3 content, but reduced E2 concentration. Extracellular histone H3 facilitated ferroptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) induced by LPS through activating the ROS/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Moreover, E2 antagonized the effect of extracellular histone H3 on LPS-induced HUVEC ferroptosis and sepsis injury in CLP-induced animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We highlighted that extracellular histone H3 facilitated lipopolysaccharides-induced HUVEC ferroptosis via activating ROS/JNK pathway, and such an effect could be antagonized by E2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sepsis increases ferroptosis and extracellular histone H3 content, but reduces estradiol (E2) concentration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extracellular histone H3 induces ferroptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E2 antagonizes the effect of extracellular histone H3 on LPS-induced HUVEC ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extracellular histone H3 promotes the ferroptosis of HUVECs by activating JNK pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E2 antagonized the effect of extracellular histone H3 on sepsis injury in animal models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>PLD2 deletion alleviates disruption of tight junctions in sepsis-induced ALI by regulating PA/STAT3 phosphorylation pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36700766/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PLD2 inhibition attenuated PA-induced STAT3 phosphorylation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STAT3 signaling pathway negatively regulated the expression levels of claudin5, occludin and ZO-1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking PLD2 can improve ARDS, and PLD2 may be a therapeutic target in ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Increased inflammatory exudation caused by endothelium and endothelial junction damage is a typical pathological feature of acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury (ARDS/ALI). Previous studies have shown that phospholipase D2 (PLD2) can increase the inflammatory response and has a close relationship with the severity of sepsis-induced ALI and the mortality of sepsis, but its mechanism is unknown. This study explored the effect and mechanism of PLD2 deletion on the structure and function of endothelial tight junction (TJ) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used C57BL/6 mice (wild-type and PLD2 knockout (PLD2-/-)) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) models of sepsis-ALI. The pathological changes were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Pulmonary vascular permeability was detected using wet-dry ratio, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran, FITC-albumin, and immunoglobulin M concentration of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. FITC-dextran and &lt;em&gt;trans&lt;/em&gt;-endothelial electrical resistance assay were used to evaluate endothelial permeability on LPS-stimulated HUVECs. The mRNA expressions of TJ proteins were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Then, protein levels were detected through Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. The content of phosphatidic acid (PA), a downstream product of PLD2, was detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; PLD2 deficiency not only alleviated lung histopathological changes and improved pulmonary vascular permeability but also increased the survival rate of ALI mice. Knockout of PLD2 or treatment with the PLD2 inhibitor can reduce the damage of endothelial TJ proteins, namely, claudin5, occludin and zonula occludens protein-1, in sepsis-ALI mice and LPS-stimulated HUVECs. The level of the PLD2 catalytic product PA increased in LPS-stimulated HUVECs, and exogenous PA can reduce the TJ protein expression and increase signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in vitro. Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation attenuated PA-induced degradation of endothelial TJs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; PLD2 knockout or inhibition may protect against LPS-induced lung injury by regulating the PA/STAT3 phosphorylation/endothelial TJ axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting TPO-independent strategy in the discovery of a novel megakaryocytopoiesis inducer DMAG for treatment of thrombocytopenia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36546424/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrombocytopenia is a TPO-related life-threatening disorder with very limited treatment options. Typical thrombopoietic agents targeting TPO signaling encounter a huge challenge. Thus, it is urgent to discover a novel TPO-independent mechanism involving thrombopoiesis and its potential targeted medications. Here, we developed a drug screening model by the Multi-Grained Cascade Forest (gcForest) algorithm and identified that 3,8-Di-O-methylellagic acid 2-O-glucoside (DMAG) (10, 20 and 40 μM) promoted megakaryocyte differentiation in vitro. Subsequent investigations revealed that DMAG (40 μM) activated ERK1/2, HIF-1β and NF-E2. Inhibition of ERK1/2 blocked megakaryocyte differentiation and attenuated the upregulation of HIF-1β and NF-E2 induced by DMAG. Megakaryocyte differentiation induced by DMAG was inhibited via knockdown of NF-E2. In vivo studies showed that DMAG (5 mg/kg) accelerated platelet recovery and megakaryocyte differentiation in mice with thrombocytopenia. The platelet level of DMAG-treated group recovered to almost 72% and 96% of control group at day 10 and 14. The platelet counts in the DMAG-treated group exhibited almost 1.5 and 1.3 fold higher compared with the irradiation (IR) group at day 10 and 14. Moreover, DMAG (10, 25 and 50 μM) stimulated thrombopoiesis in zebrafish. DMAG (5 mg/kg) could also increase platelet levels in c-MPL knockout (c-MPL-/-) mice. In summary, we establish a drug screening model through gcForest and demonstrate DMAG promotes megakaryocyte differentiation via the ERK/HIF1/NF-E2 pathway, which is more importantly independent of the TPO/c-MPL classic pathway. The present study may provide new insights into drug discovery for thrombopoiesis, TPO-independent regulation of thrombopoiesis and a promising avenue for thrombocytopenia treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resolution of post-lung transplant ischemia-reperfusion injury is modulated via Resolvin D1-FPR2 and Maresin 1-LGR6 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36628837/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Dysregulation of inflammation-resolution pathways leads to postlung transplant (LTx) ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and allograft dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that combined treatment with specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, that is, Resolvin D1 (RvD1) and Maresin-1 (MaR1), enhances inflammation-resolution of lung IR injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Expression of RvD1 and MaR1 was analyzed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients on days 0, 1, and 7 post-LTx. Lung IR injury was evaluated in C57BL/6 (WT), FPR2-/-, and LGR6 siRNA treated mice using a hilar-ligation model with or without administration with RvD1 and/or MaR1. A donation after circulatory death and murine orthotopic lung transplantation model was used to evaluate the protection by RvD1 and MaR1 against lung IR injury. In vitro studies analyzed alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cell activation after treatment with RvD1 or MaR1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; RvD1 and MaR1 expressions in BAL from post-LTx patients was significantly increased on day 7 compared to days 0 and 1. Concomitant RvD1 and MaR1 treatment significantly mitigated early pulmonary inflammation and lung IR injury in WT mice, which was regulated via FPR2 and LGR6 receptors. In the murine orthotopic donation after cardiac death LTx model, RvD1 and MaR1 treatments significantly attenuated lung IR injury and increased PaO2 levels compared to saline-treated controls. Mechanistically, RvD1/FPR2 signaling on alveolar macrophages attenuated HMGB1 and TNF-α secretion and upregulated uptake of macrophage-dependent apoptotic neutrophils (efferocytosis), whereas MaR1/LGR6 signaling mitigated CXCL1 secretion by epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Bioactive proresolving lipid mediator-dependent signaling that is, RvD1/FPR2 and MaR1/LGR6- offers a novel therapeutic strategy in post-LTx injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BAP31 regulates the expression of ICAM-1/VCAM-1 via MyD88/NF-κB pathway in acute lung injury mice model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549351/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; The cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that mediate neutrophil-endothelium cell adhesion are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). B-cell receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31) has been reported to engage in the expression of some CAMs. This study was undertaken to explore whether BAP31 in endotheliocyte affects the pathological process of ALI by regulating CAMs, and its possible mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; Our study used the shBAP31 endothelium cell lines and endothelial-specific BAP31 conditional knockdown mice constructed via Cre/loxP system. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the histopathological manifestations. The adhesion of neutrophils to vascular wall was examined by intravital microscopy. The nuclear translocation of NF-κB was observed by immunofluorescence staining assay. Flow cytometric, real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assay were performed to determine the expression of CAMs and key proteins in MyD88/NF-κB-related signaling pathway. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were analyzed for transcriptional activity of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; Mechanistic investigations indicated that endothelium-specific BAP31 depletion dramatically reduced the capacity of neutrophils adherence to endothelial cells (ECs), which was mainly attributed to the significant downregulation of ICAM-1 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and VCAM-1 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) expression. Interestingly, BAP31 knockdown apparently deactivated MyD88/TRAF6-mediated TAK1/NF-κB and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades, resulting in the inhibition of NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; Our data furnished convincing evidence that BAP31 deficiency performs a mitigative effect on ALI by decreasing neutrophils-ECs adhesion. These findings identified BAP31 as a promising protein for regulating the pathogenesis process of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PI3K/AKT-mediated autophagy inhibition facilitates mast cell activation to enhance severe inflammatory lung injury in influenza A virus- and secondary Staphylococcus aureus-infected mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549394/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality each year globally, and secondary bacterial infection further exacerbates the severity and fatality of the initial viral infection. Mast cells have substantial roles in protecting the respiratory tract mucosa, while their role in viral and bacterial co-infection remains unclear. The present study revealed that secondary Staphylococcus aureus infection significantly aggravated the activation of mast cells during the initial H1N1 infection both in vivo and in vitro, which was closely related to the increased inflammatory lung injury and mortality. Meanwhile, the secondary S. aureus infection suppressed autophagy and promoted inflammatory mediators released by mast cells through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Blocking PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation, could rescue autophagy and inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, based on the influenza A viral and secondary bacterial infected mice model, we showed that the combination of LY294002 and antiviral drug oseltamivir could effectively reduce the inflammatory damage and pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing in lungs, recovering body weight loss and improving the survival rate from the co-infections. In conclusion, secondary bacterial infection can inhibit autophagy and stimulate mast cell activation through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which might explain why secondary bacterial infection would cause severe and fatal consequences following an initial influenza A viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protein interaction network between MANF and biomarkers of inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and iron death was constructed by STRING and GeneMania.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rmMANF pretreatment inhibits ferroptosis in septic associated-lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rmMANF pretreatment inhibits ferroptosis by suppressing GRP78/PERK/ATF4 axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis plays a critical role in LPS-induced acute lung injury and is modulated by endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). As a typical ER stress-responsive protein, recently mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) has been demonstrated to attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) through repressing macrophage activation. However, whether MANF exerts a preventive role on ferroptosis and excess ER stress remains unclear. Here, we first built a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to obtain potential interacting proteins related to MANF through STRING and GeneMANIA. Then, male C57BL/6J mice were used to build a model of LPS-induced lung injury. Two days before LPS injection, the tail vein injected recombinant murine MANF (rmMANF) at 750 μg/kg. Twenty-four hours after the LPS injection, the histopathological changes and damage in the lung tissues were detected and scored by HE staining and TUNEL assay, respectively. Endogenous MANF levels, oxidative stress markers (GSH, SOD, CAT, and MDA), ERS markers (GRP78, PERK, and ATF4), and the ferroptosis markers (iron, GPX4, and 4-HNE) in the lung tissues were measured by IHC, western blotting, and commercial kits. Our results showed that LPS induced significant lung injury to the increase in MPO, MDA, and 4-HNE, a decrease in GPX4 and GSH, SOD, CAT, and total iron accumulation in LPS-exposed mice. Simultaneously, GRP78/PERK/ATF4 pathway was notably activated by LPS, accompanied by the down-regulation of MANF. Furthermore, rmMANF pretreatment markedly prevented LPS-induced lung tissue injury and ferroptosis characteristics with the increased GPX4 level in sepsis mice. Finally, we found that LPS-induced oxidative stress and activation of the GRP78/PERK/ATF4 pathway were significantly restrained by rmMANF pretreatment, except for endogenous MANF level. Overall, rmMANF pretreatment can prevent sepsis-associated lung injury by inhibiting ER stress-induced ferroptosis in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High yield engineered nanovesicles from ADSC with enriched miR-21-5p promote angiogenesis in adipose tissue regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36528594/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have been found to have a great potential for soft tissue repair due to various biological functions, including pro-angiogenesis and low immunogenicity. However, the low yield and heterogeneity of MSC-EVs limited their clinical transformation. This study was designed to develop a novel adipose-derived stem cell engineered nanovesicles (ADSC-NVs) with high production and explore its pro-angiogenetic effect and application in adipose tissue regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Adipose-derived stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (ADSC-EVs) were isolated from an EVs-free culture medium for human ADSCs (hADSCs). ADSC-NVs were prepared by sequentially extruding ADSCs followed by iodixanol density gradient ultracentrifugation and were compared with ADSC-EVs in morphology, size distribution, protein contents and yield. The pro-angiogenetic effect of ADSC-NVs in different doses (0, 5, 20 and 80 μg/mL) in vitro was determined using transwell assay, tube formation assay, western blot and qRT-PCR. In vivo, BALB/c nude mice were administered injection of a mixture of fat granules and different dose of ADSC-NVs and grafts were harvested at 12 weeks post-transplantation for further analysis. By analyzing the weight and volume of grafts and histological evaluation, we investigated the effect of ADSC-NVs in vessel formation and adipose tissue regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our results showed yield of purified ADSC-NVs was approximately 20 times more than that of ADSC-EVs secreted by the same number of ADSCs. In vitro, both ADSC-NVs and ADSC-EVs exhibited a dose-dependent pro-angiogenetic effect, despite their distinct miRNA profiles. These effects of ADSC-NVs may be mediated by enriched miR-21-5p via PTEN inhibition and PI3K/p-Akt signaling activation. Furthermore, after a mixed injection of ADSC-NVs, vessel formation and adipose regeneration were observed in vivo in fat implants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study developed a potent alternative of ADSC-EVs. ADSC-NVs have a high pro-angiogenesis potential and can be used as cell-free therapeutic biomaterials in soft tissue regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 promotes kidney injury by regulating β-catenin signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36520532/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wnt/β-catenin is a developmental signaling pathway that plays a crucial role in driving kidney fibrosis after injury. Activation of β-catenin is presumed to be regulated through the posttranslational protein modification. Little is known about whether β-catenin is also subjected to regulation at the posttranscriptional mRNA level. Here, we report that insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) plays a pivotal role in regulating β-catenin. IGF2BP3 was upregulated in renal tubular epithelium of various animal models and patients with chronic kidney disease. IGF2BP3 not only was a direct downstream target of Wnt/β-catenin but also was obligatory for transducing Wnt signal. In vitro, overexpression of IGF2BP3 in kidney tubular cells induced fibrotic responses, whereas knockdown of endogenous IGF2BP3 prevented the expression of injury and fibrosis markers in tubular cells after Wnt3a stimulation. In vivo, exogenous IGF2BP3 promoted β-catenin activation and aggravated kidney fibrosis, while knockdown of IGF2BP3 ameliorated renal fibrotic lesions after obstructive injury. RNA immunoprecipitation and mRNA stability assays revealed that IGF2BP3 directly bound to β-catenin mRNA and stabilized it against degradation. Furthermore, knockdown of IGF2BP3 in tubular cells accelerated β-catenin mRNA degradation in vitro. These studies demonstrate that IGF2BP3 promotes β-catenin signaling and drives kidney fibrosis, which may be mediated through stabilizing β-catenin mRNA. Our findings uncover a previously underappreciated dimension of the complex regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and suggest a potential target for therapeutic intervention of fibrotic kidney diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JCAD promotes arterial thrombosis through PI3K/Akt modulation: a translational study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36469488/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Variants of the junctional cadherin 5 associated (JCAD) locus associate with acute coronary syndromes. JCAD promotes experimental atherosclerosis through the large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2)/Hippo pathway. This study investigates the role of JCAD in arterial thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and results:&lt;/em&gt; JCAD knockout (&lt;em&gt;Jcad&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice underwent photochemically induced endothelial injury to trigger arterial thrombosis. Primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) treated with JCAD small interfering RNA (&lt;em&gt;siJCAD&lt;/em&gt;), LATS2 small interfering RNA (&lt;em&gt;siLATS2&lt;/em&gt;) or control siRNA (siSCR) were employed for in vitro assays. Plasma JCAD was measured in patients with chronic coronary syndrome or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). &lt;em&gt;Jcad&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice displayed reduced thrombogenicity as reflected by delayed time to carotid occlusion. Mechanisms include reduced activation of the coagulation cascade [reduced tissue factor (TF) expression and activity] and increased fibrinolysis [higher thrombus embolization episodes and D-dimer levels, reduced vascular plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 expression]. In vitro, JCAD silencing inhibited TF and PAI-1 expression in HAECs. JCAD-silenced HAECs (&lt;em&gt;siJCAD&lt;/em&gt;) displayed increased levels of LATS2 kinase. Yet, double JCAD and LATS2 silencing did not restore the control phenotype. &lt;em&gt;si-JCAD&lt;/em&gt; HAECs showed increased levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/proteinkinase B (Akt) activation, known to downregulate procoagulant expression. The PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor-wortmannin-prevented the effect of JCAD silencing on TF and PAI-1, indicating a causative role. Also, co-immunoprecipitation unveiled a direct interaction between JCAD and Akt. Confirming in vitro findings, PI3K/Akt and P-yes-associated protein levels were higher in &lt;em&gt;Jcad&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; animals. Lastly, as compared with chronic coronary syndrome, STEMI patients showed higher plasma JCAD, which notably correlated positively with both TF and PAI-1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; JCAD promotes arterial thrombosis by modulating coagulation and fibrinolysis. Herein, reported translational data suggest JCAD as a potential therapeutic target for atherothrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JMJD3 Is Required for Acute Pancreatitis and Pancreatitis-Associated Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36458991/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be complicated by inflammatory disorders of remote organs, such as lung injury, in which Jumonji domain-containing protein 3 (JMJD3) plays a vital role in proinflammatory responses. Currently, we found that JMJD3 expression was upregulated in the pancreas and lung in an AP male mouse model, which was also confirmed in AP patients. Further experiments revealed that the upregulation of JMJD3 and proinflammatory effects were possibly exerted by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or oxidized-mtDNA from tissue injury caused by AP. The release of mtDNA and oxidized-mtDNA contributed to the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes in lung injury through the stimulator of IFN genes (STING)/TLR9-NF-κB-JMJD3-TNF-α pathway. The inhibition of JMJD3 or utilization of Jmjd3-cKO mice significantly alleviated pulmonary inflammation induced by AP. Blocking mtDNA oxidation or knocking down the TLR9/STING pathway effectively alleviated inflammation. Therefore, inhibition of JMJD3 or STING/TLR9 pathway blockage might be a potential therapeutic strategy to treat AP and the associated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attenuation of the Severity of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by Pomiferin through Blocking Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in an AKT/Foxo1 Pathway-Dependent Manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36471865/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) gives rise to uncontrolled inflammatory response and oxidative stress, causing very high mortality globally. Pomiferin is a kind of prenylated isoflavonoid extracted from &lt;em&gt;Maclura pomifera&lt;/em&gt;, owning anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the functions and possible mechanisms of pomiferin in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ARDS remain unknown. C57BL/6 mice were injected with LPS (5 mg/kg) intratracheally to induce an in vivo ARDS model while RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) to induce an in vitro model. Our data demonstrated that pomiferin (20 mg/kg) significantly improved pulmonary function and lung pathological injury in mice with ARDS, apart from increasing survival rate. Meanwhile, pomiferin treatment also inhibited LPS-induced inflammation as well as oxidative stress in lung tissues. LPS stimulation significantly activated AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway in lung tissues, which could be reversed after pomiferin treatment. In vitro experiments further showed that 10, 20, and 50 μM of pomiferin could enhance cell viability of RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with LPS. What is more, 3-deoxysappanchalcone (3-DE), one AKT agonist, was used to active AKT in RAW264.7 macrophages. The results further showed that 3-DE could abolish pomiferin-elicited protection in LPS-treated RAW264.7 macrophages, evidenced by activated inflammation and oxidative stress. Taken together, our study showed that pomiferin could exert an ARDS-protective effect by blocking the AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway to inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative injury, which may serve as a potential candidate for the treatment of ARDS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;SCPA is a dedicated tool for pathway analysis in scRNA-seq data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCPA assesses the multivariate distributions of pathways to detect significance&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathway analysis is a key analytical stage in the interpretation of omics data, providing a powerful method for detecting alterations in cellular processes. We recently developed a sensitive and distribution-free statistical framework for multisample distribution testing, which we implement here in the open-source R package single-cell pathway analysis (SCPA). We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCPA over commonly used methods, generate a scRNA-seq T cell dataset, and characterize pathway activity over early cellular activation. This reveals regulatory pathways in T cells, including an intrinsic type I interferon system regulating T cell survival and a reliance on arachidonic acid metabolism throughout T cell activation. A systems-level characterization of pathway activity in T cells across multiple tissues also identifies alpha-defensin expression as a hallmark of bone-marrow-derived T cells. Overall, this work provides a widely applicable tool for single-cell pathway analysis and highlights regulatory mechanisms of T cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1,2,3,4,6-O-Pentagalloylglucose Protects against Acute Lung Injury by Activating the AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36430900/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious lung disease with a high mortality rate, warranting the development of novel therapies. Previously, we reported that 1,2,3,4,6-O-pentagalloylglucose (PGG) could afford protection against ALI, however, the PGG-mediated protective effects remain elusive. Herein, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) markedly inhibited the lung wet/drug weight ratio and attenuated histological changes in the lungs (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). A pretreatment with PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) reduced the number of total leukocytes and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) also attenuated oxidative stress by reducing the formation of formation and the depletion of superoxide dismutase to treat an ALI (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). To further explore the PGG-induced mechanism against an ALI, we screened the PGG pathway using immunohistochemical analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and Western blotting (WB). WB revealed that the expression levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (p-AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B phosphorylation (P-Akt), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) were significantly higher in the PGG group (60 and 30 mg/kg) than in the lipopolysaccharide group (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05); these findings were confirmed by the immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence results. Accordingly, PGG could be effective against an ALI by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress via AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling, allowing for the potential development of this as a natural drug against an ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uterine macrophages as treatment targets for therapy of premature rupture of membranes by modified ADSC-EVs through a circRNA/miRNA/NF-κB pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36402996/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Circular RNA (circRNA) is a type of stable non-coding RNA that modifies macrophage inflammation by sponging micro RNAs (miRNAs), binding to RNA-binding proteins, and undergoing translation into peptides. Activated M1 phenotype macrophages secrete matrix metalloproteinases to participate in softening of the cervix uteri to promote vaginal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the premature rupture of membranes (PROM) mouse model was used to analyze the role of macrophages in this process. Profiling of circRNAs was performed using a competing endogenous RNA microarray, and their functions were elucidated in vitro. Meanwhile, adipose tissue-derived stem cell-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) were applied as a vehicle to transport small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the circRNAs to demonstrate their biological function in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The miRNA &lt;em&gt;miR-1931&lt;/em&gt; is dependent on the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway but negatively regulates its activation by targeting the NF-κB signaling transducer TRAF6 to prevent polarization of M1 macrophages and inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion. The host gene of circRNA &lt;em&gt;B4GALNT1&lt;/em&gt;, also an NF-κB pathway-dependent gene, circularizes to form &lt;em&gt;circRNA_0002047&lt;/em&gt;, which sponges &lt;em&gt;miR-1931&lt;/em&gt; to maintain NF-κB pathway activation and MMP secretion in vitro. In the PROM model, EVs loaded with siRNAs targeting circRNAs demonstrated that the circRNAs reduced &lt;em&gt;miR-1931&lt;/em&gt; expression to maintain NF-κB pathway activation and MMP secretion for accelerating PROM in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our data provide insights into understanding PROM pathogenesis and improving PROM treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viral infection induces acute blood glucose decline in rodents that activates AMPK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMPK directly phosphorylates TBK1 at S511 to prime antiviral sensing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMPK-TBK1 couples glucose deficiency sensing and innate immune surveillance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting the AMPK-TBK1 axis compromises innate antiviral immunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutrient sensing and damage sensing are two fundamental processes in living organisms. While hyperglycemia is frequently linked to diabetes-related vulnerability to microbial infection, how body glucose levels affect innate immune responses to microbial invasion is not fully understood. Here, we surprisingly found that viral infection led to a rapid and dramatic decrease in blood glucose levels in rodents, leading to robust AMPK activation. AMPK, once activated, directly phosphorylates TBK1 at S511, which triggers IRF3 recruitment and the assembly of MAVS or STING signalosomes. Consistently, ablation or inhibition of AMPK, knockin of TBK1-S511A, or increased glucose levels compromised nucleic acid sensing, while boosting AMPK-TBK1 cascade by AICAR or TBK1-S511E knockin improves antiviral immunity substantially in various animal models. Thus, we identify TBK1 as an AMPK substrate, reveal the molecular mechanism coupling a dual sensing of glucose and nuclei acids, and report its physiological necessity in antiviral defense.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astaxanthin ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via inhibition of inflammatory reactions and modulation of the SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a systemic inflammatory process. A large number of studies have shown that astaxanthin (ASTA) has strong anti-inflammatory effects and almost non-toxic side effects. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of ASTA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice and its underlying mechanism. The result showed that compared with the LPS group, the expression levels of the respiratory resistance (Re), inspiratory resistance (Ri), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio, albumin (BA/SA) ratio and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the ASTA pretreatment group were significantly reduced, and total cell, neutrophil and macrophage counts were significantly decreased. HE staining results showed that alveolar interstitial edema, bleeding and erythrocyte exudation were reduced. Compared with the LPS group, the percentage of Th17 cells and the content of interleukin (IL)-17 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the ASTA pretreatment group were significantly decreased, while the content of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and the percentage of Treg cells were significantly increased. Western blot analysis showed that ASTA could up-regulate the expression level of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) and down-regulate the expression levels of phosphorylated Janus kinase 2 (p-JAK2), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) in lung tissue. The results showed that ASTA had a protective effect on LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, and its protective mechanism was through activating the SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting Treg cell differentiation and reducing inflammatory reactions and Th17 cell differentiation, which provided a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tegument protein UL21 of alpha-herpesvirus inhibits the innate immunity by triggering CGAS degradation through TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36343628/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha-herpesvirus causes lifelong infections and serious diseases in a wide range of hosts and has developed multiple strategies to counteract the host defense. Here, we demonstrate that the tegument protein UL21 (unique long region 21) in pseudorabies virus (PRV) dampens type I interferon signaling by triggering the degradation of CGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) through the macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosome pathway. Mechanistically, the UL21 protein scaffolds the E3 ligase UBE3C (ubiquitin protein ligase E3C) to catalyze the K27-linked ubiquitination of CGAS at Lys384, which is recognized by the cargo receptor TOLLIP (toll interacting protein) and degraded in the lysosome. Additionally, we show that the N terminus of UL21 in PRV is dominant in destabilizing CGAS-mediated innate immunity. Moreover, viral tegument protein UL21 in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) also displays the conserved inhibitory mechanisms. Furthermore, by using PRV, we demonstrate the roles of UL21 in degrading CGAS to promote viral infection in vivo. Altogether, these findings describe a distinct pathway where alpha-herpesvirus exploits TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagy to evade host antiviral immunity, highlighting a new interface of interplay between the host and DNA virus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblast growth factor 10 protects against particulate matter-induced lung injury by inhibiting oxidative stress-mediated pyroptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36461597/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulate matter (PM) is a major environmental contaminant that causes and worsens respiratory diseases. Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10), a paracrine fibroblast growth factor that specifically stimulates repair and regeneration after injury, has been shown to protect against PM-induced lung injury. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, the protective effects of FGF10 were investigated using a PM-induced lung injury mouse model in vivo and BEAS-2B cells in vitro. According to the findings, FGF10 treatment alleviated PM-induced oxidative damage and pyroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, FGF10 activated antioxidative Nrf2 signaling. Inhibition of PI3K signaling with LY294002 or Nrf2 signaling with ML385 revealed that FGF10-mediated lung protection was mediated by the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. These results collectively indicate that FGF10 inhibits oxidative stress-mediated pyroptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway, suggesting a possible therapy for PM-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mefunidone ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury through inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway and enhancing Nrf2 pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary edema and hyperemia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary structure disorder, inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone reduces reactive oxygen species generation through increasing expression of nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and objective:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease which has high mortality and lacks effective pharmacological treatments. Excessive inflammation and oxidative stress are the key pathogenesis of ALI. Mefunidone (MFD), a novel small molecule compound, displayed anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress effects on streptozocin (STZ) and db/db mice in our previous studies. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of MFD on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and explore the potential molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the effects of MFD on LPS-induced ALI mouse model and LPS-stimulated immortalized mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MFD could alleviate pulmonary structure disorder and attenuate pulmonary neutrophils infiltration induced by LPS. MFD could also decreased proinflammatory cytokines release and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation stimulated by LPS. Further, MFD could significantly reduce LPS-induced phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), increase expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and restore the expressions of antioxidant enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results firstly supported that MFD effectively protected LPS-induced ALI against inflammation and oxidative stress through inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway and activating Nrf2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Naringenin attenuates inflammation, apoptosis, and ferroptosis in silver nanoparticle-induced lung injury through a mechanism associated with Nrf2/HO-1 axis: In vitro and in vivo studies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36306867/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the wide application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), their potential damage to human health needs to be investigated. Lung is one of the main target organs after inhalation of AgNPs. Naringenin has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of naringenin against AgNPs-induced lung injury and determine the underlying mechanism. In in vivo experiments, AgNPs were intratracheally instilled into ICR mice (l mg/kg) to establish a lung injury model. These mice were then treated with naringenin by oral gavage (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) for three days. Naringenin treatment decreased the levels of white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in the blood, ameliorated lung injury, suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, normalized ferroptotic markers and prevented oxidative stress with elevating Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expressions in lung. In in vitro experiments, BEAS-2B cells were firstly treated with AgNPs (320 μg/mL) and then naringenin (25, 50, and 100 μM), respectively. Naringenin attenuated AgNPs-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Moreover, naringenin attenuated AgNPs-induced apoptosis with modulated low BAX, CytC, cleaved Caspase9, cleaved Caspase3 but high Bcl2. Furthermore, naringenin effectively decreased ferroptotic markers and increased the protein expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1, as well as increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Importantly, the anti-apoptotic and anti-ferroptotic effects of naringenin in BEAS-2B cells were found to be at least partially Nrf2-dependent. These results indicated that naringenin exerted anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and anti-ferroptosis effects and protected against AgNPs-induced lung injury at least partly via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rhein ameliorates septic lung injury and intervenes in macrophage metabolic reprogramming in the inflammatory state by Sirtuin 1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36279970/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein prevented the progression of acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metabolism in sepsis pathological state was changed after Rhein treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein inhibited the over activation of macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein preconditioning up-regulated and activated SIRT1 signal pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is an organ dysfunction syndrome caused by the maladjustment of response to infection. Acute lung injury (ALI) appears the earliest, with urgent onset and limited treatments. Previous pharmacological studies have found that rhein (RH), an active ingredient rich in rhubarb, has multiple pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-infection and metabolic regulation. This research aimed to explore whether RH alleviates septic acute lung injury and probe possible mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the septic ALI mouse model was established by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). LPS-induced RAW264.7 model was selected to further explore the protective mechanism of RH. H&amp;amp;E staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR, and 1H NMR analysis were used to verify the protective effect of RH on ALI &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; RH could relieve pathological lung injury and pulmonary edema, reduce the serum LPS and inhibit inflammatory response in CLP mice. Further studies displayed that RH affected the metabolism &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, with significant changes in serum and lung metabolomics. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; results demonstrated that RH inhibited the expression of inflammatory mediators and factors in macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming and upregulating the expression of Sirtuin 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; RH improved the overall metabolic condition of sepsis mice by up-regulating and activating SIRT1, and inhibited the over activation of macrophages by regulating metabolism. These findings reveal the therapeutic mechanism of RH on sepsis ALI from the perspective of metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The influenza virus PB2 protein evades antiviral innate immunity by inhibiting JAK1/STAT signalling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) polymerase protein PB2 has been shown to partially inhibit the host immune response by blocking the induction of interferons (IFNs). However, the IAV PB2 protein that regulates the downstream signaling pathway of IFNs is not well characterized. Here, we report that IAV PB2 protein reduces cellular sensitivity to IFNs, suppressing the activation of STAT1/STAT2 and ISGs. Furthermore, IAV PB2 protein targets mammalian JAK1 at lysine 859 and 860 for ubiquitination and degradation. Notably, the H5 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus with I283M/K526R mutations on PB2 increases the ability to degrade mammalian JAK1 and exhibits higher replicate efficiency in mammalian (but not avian) cells and mouse lung tissues, and causes greater mortality in infected mice. Altogether, these data describe a negative regulatory mechanism involving PB2-JAK1 and provide insights into an evasion strategy from host antiviral immunity employed by IAV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BP5 alleviates endotoxemia-induced acute lung injury by activating Nrf2 via dual regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and the Akt (Ser473)/GSK3β (Ser9)/Fyn pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress and inflammation play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). Previously, pentapeptide bursopentin (BP5, Cys-Lys-Arg-Val-Tyr) was reported to possess significant antioxidant activity and inhibit lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced NF-κB activation in vitro, whereas little is known about its effects in vivo. In this study, we explored the effects of BP5 on endotoxemia-induced ALI in mice and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our studies revealed that BP5 markedly improved survival and effectively alleviated lung injury by reducing overoxidation and excessive inflammatory response in endotoxemia mice. In LPS-stimulated mouse primary macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells, BP5 also exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties by enhancing Nrf2 activation. Importantly, these beneficial effects were abolished by Nrf2 knockdown. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we performed localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) assays, molecular docking, together with cell-based studies, and found that BP5 inhibited the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction to promote Nrf2 nuclear translocation and activation. Moreover, BP5-induced Nrf2 activation was shown to be accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt (at Ser473) and GSK3β (at Ser9), and a decrease in Fyn nuclear accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacologically inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β obviously enhanced Fyn nuclear accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells, which partially attenuated the promoting effect of BP5 on Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and activation. Furthermore, In Nrf2-/- mice, the protective effects of BP5 on the endotoxemia-induced ALI in WT mice were largely vanished. Our findings indicated that BP5 effectively protected endotoxemia-induced ALI against oxidative stress and inflammatory response, which are largely dependent on activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Underlying mechanisms include dual regulation of the Keap-Nrf2 interaction and the Akt (Ser473)/GSK3β (Ser9)/Fyn pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of environmental factors that promote intestinal inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36266581/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide association studies have identified risk loci linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-a complex chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. The increasing prevalence of IBD in industrialized countries and the augmented disease risk observed in migrants who move into areas of higher disease prevalence suggest that environmental factors are also important determinants of IBD susceptibility and severity. However, the identification of environmental factors relevant to IBD and the mechanisms by which they influence disease has been hampered by the lack of platforms for their systematic investigation. Here we describe an integrated systems approach, combining publicly available databases, zebrafish chemical screens, machine learning and mouse preclinical models to identify environmental factors that control intestinal inflammation. This approach established that the herbicide propyzamide increases inflammation in the small and large intestine. Moreover, we show that an AHR-NF-κB-C/EBPβ signalling axis operates in T cells and dendritic cells to promote intestinal inflammation, and is targeted by propyzamide. In conclusion, we developed a pipeline for the identification of environmental factors and mechanisms of pathogenesis in IBD and, potentially, other inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin prevents against LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin attenuates ferroptosis against lps-induced acute lung injury by Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a form of regulated nonapoptotic cell death associated with iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Previous studies have shown that ferroptosis is involved in the occurrence and development of acute lung injury (ALI). In this study, a systems pharmacology approach was performed through the overall process of target acquisition, network construction, and further analysis. Then, the effects of astaxanthin on LPS-induced inflammation and ferroptosis were investigated in RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS in vitro and ALI mice induced by LPS in vivo. The enrichment analysis of astaxanthin-target gene is closely related to the occurrence and development mechanism of ferroptosis. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of astaxanthin acting on ALI found that these intersection genes are associated with ALI inflammatory pathway. In addition, astaxanthin can effectively inhibit LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ferroptosis in RAW264.7 cells. Consistently, administration of astaxanthin protected mice against LPS-induced ALI and significantly decreased the extent of lung edema, inflammatory cells infiltration, and ferroptosis in vivo, and Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is involved in astaxanthin inhibits LPS-induced ALI and ferroptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that astaxanthin inhibit inflammation and ferroptosis by regulating Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to reduce LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-1249 on Endothelial Extracellular Vesicles Mediates Cigarette Smoke-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension by Inhibiting HDAC10 (Histone Deacetylase 10)-NFκB (Nuclear Factor κB)-CaSR (Calcium-Sensing Receptor) Cascade</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Overproduction of endothelial extracellular vesicles (eEVs) is correlated with pulmonary hypertension progression, but the precise mechanism remains largely unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; MicroRNA-chip and real-time polymerase chain reaction were conducted to screen and validate microRNA profiles in blood plasma eEVs of rats and human with or without cigarette smoking. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were cultured to study signaling pathways. Pulmonary hypertension phenotypes were evaluated in wild-type and calcium-sensing receptor knockout rats to identify the pathophysiological significance of the microRNA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MicroR-1249 was predominant highly expressed in eEVs from plasma of rats exposed to cigarette smoking, and confirmed in eEVs from plasma of human smokers as well as in eEVs from cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery endothelial cells, but not in cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. In cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, microR-1249 downregulated the expression of histone deacetylase 10, which in turn enhanced the acetylated form of NFκB (nuclear factor κB) level and its nuclear translocation leading to increased expression of calcium-sensing receptor. In rats, the repression of microR-1249 in eEVs by microR-1249 inhibitor, histone deacetylase 10 overexpression, or calcium-sensing receptor knockout profoundly inhibited the proliferative capacities and diminished apoptosis-resistance of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and pulmonary hypertension development in rats intravenously administrated with eEVs preparation from cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Cigarette smoke-enriched microR-1249 in endothelial extracellular vesicles facilitates the hyperproliferative and antiapoptotic status of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells promoting pulmonary hypertension evolution through the inhibition of histone deacetylase 10-NFκB-calcium-sensing receptor cascade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schisandrin B protects against LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury by targeting MyD88</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36270224/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36270224/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a challenging clinical syndrome that manifests as an acute inflammatory response. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a bioactive lignan from Schisandra genus plants, has been shown to suppress inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypothesis/purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study performed an in-depth investigation of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Sch B in macrophages and in an animal model of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; qPCR array was used to probe the differential effects and potential target of Sch B. ALI was induced by intratracheal administration of LPS in experimental mice with or without Sch B treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our studies show that Sch B differentially modulates inflammatory factor induction by LPS in macrophages by directly binding myeloid differentiation response factor-88 (MyD88), an essential adaptor protein in the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) pathway. Sch B spares non-MyD88-pathways downstream of TLR4. Such inhibition suppressed key signaling mediators such as TAK1, MAPKs, and NF-κB, and pro-inflammatory factor induction. Pull down assay using biotinylated-Sch B validate the direct interaction between Sch B and MyD88 in macrophages. Treatment of mice with Sch B prior to LPS challenge reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in lungs, induction of MyD88-pathway signaling proteins, and prevented inflammatory cytokine induction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, our studies have identified MyD88 as a direct target of Sch B for its anti-inflammatory activity, and suggest that Sch B may have therapeutic value for acute lung injury and other MyD88-dependent inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of Stimulator of IFN Genes (STING) Causes Proteinuria and Contributes to Glomerular Diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36198430/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36198430/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The signaling molecule stimulator of IFN genes (STING) was identified as a crucial regulator of the DNA-sensing cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway, and this signaling pathway regulates inflammation and energy homeostasis under conditions of obesity, kidney fibrosis, and AKI. However, the role of STING in causing CKD, including diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and Alport syndrome, is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate whether STING activation contributes to the development and progression of glomerular diseases such as DKD and Alport syndrome, immortalized human and murine podocytes were differentiated for 14 days and treated with a STING-specific agonist. We used diabetic db/db mice, mice with experimental Alport syndrome, C57BL/6 mice, and STING knockout mice to assess the role of the STING signaling pathway in kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, murine and human podocytes express all of the components of the cGAS-STING pathway. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, activation of STING renders C57BL/6 mice susceptible to albuminuria and podocyte loss. STING is activated at baseline in mice with experimental DKD and Alport syndrome. STING activation occurs in the glomerular but not the tubulointerstitial compartment in association with autophagic podocyte death in Alport syndrome mice and with apoptotic podocyte death in DKD mouse models. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of STING protects from progression of kidney disease in mice with DKD and Alport syndrome and increases lifespan in Alport syndrome mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The activation of the STING pathway acts as a mediator of disease progression in DKD and Alport syndrome. Targeting STING may offer a therapeutic option to treat glomerular diseases of metabolic and nonmetabolic origin or prevent their development, progression, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hedgehog pathway and its inhibitors in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36191777/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/36191777/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COPD affects millions of people and is now ranked as the third leading cause of death worldwide. This largely untreatable chronic airway disease results in irreversible destruction of lung architecture. The small lung hypothesis is now supported by epidemiological, physiological and clinical studies. Accordingly, the early and severe COPD phenotype carries the most dreadful prognosis and finds its roots during lung growth. Pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood and implicate individual susceptibility (genetics), a large part of environmental factors (viral infections, tobacco consumption, air pollution) and the combined effects of those triggers on gene expression. Genetic susceptibility is most likely involved as the disease is severe and starts early in life. The latter observation led to the identification of Mendelian inheritance via disease-causing variants of SERPINA1 - known as the basis for alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and TERT. In the last two decades multiple genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with COPD. High significance SNPs are located in 4q31 near HHIP which encodes an evolutionarily highly conserved physiological inhibitor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (HH). HHIP is critical to several in utero developmental lung processes. It is also implicated in homeostasis, injury response, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor resistance to apoptosis. A few studies have reported decreased HHIP RNA and protein levels in human adult COPD lungs. HHIP+/- murine models led to emphysema. HH pathway inhibitors, such as vismodegib and sonidegib, are already validated in oncology, whereas other drugs have evidenced in vitro effects. Targeting the Hedgehog pathway could lead to a new therapeutic avenue in COPD. In this review, we focused on the early and severe COPD phenotype and the small lung hypothesis by exploring genetic susceptibility traits that are potentially treatable, thus summarizing promising therapeutics for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanisms of Biochanin A Alleviating PM2.5 Organic Extracts-Induced EMT of A549 Cells through the PI3K/Akt Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36181478/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important step in tumor progression, which enables tumor cells to acquire migration and invasion characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of biological biochanin A (BCA) in ameliorating fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) lung injury. The results showed that PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; could induce spindle-like changes in cell morphology, causing the ability of migration and invasion. However, they were significantly inhibited by BCA treatment (10/20/30 μm). After BCA treatment, the release and transcription of chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor gene CXCR4 were inhibited, and the release of growth inducer TGF-β1 was significantly reduced. In addition, BCA promoted the transcription of E-cadherin and β-catenin, inhibiting the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin, and down-regulated the expression of MMP-2/9. We found that BCA effectively interfered with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activated by PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;. In conclusion, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; can induce EMT in lung cancer cells, and BCA may reverse this process by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-9a-5p alleviates ventilator-induced lung injury in rats by inhibiting the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway via CXCR4 expression downregulation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36193608/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I establishment of (ventilator-induced acute lung injury) VILI rat model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used bioinformatics software to predict the target gene of miR-9a-5p, and verified the conclusion through double Luciferase Report experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) through lavage fluid recovery technology for experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Globally, Mechanical ventilation is the most commonly used short-term life support technology. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is an inflammatory injury caused by mechanical ventilation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as new gene regulators that play an important role in lung injury and inflammation. However, the role and mechanism of action of miR-9a-5p in VILI remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Herein, a rat model of VILI was established. To determine the expression levels of miR-9a-5p and CXCR4 mRNA, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were conducted. As well as western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence analyses, we determined the expression of CXCR4, SDF-1 and MAPK signaling pathway-related kinases. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining and the wet-dry ratio of the lung tissue were used to evaluate organ injury. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity measurements were performed to evaluate the inflammatory response. In addition, double luciferase reporter assays were used to verify the association between miR-9a-5p and CXCR4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The expression of miR-9a-5p was low, whereas that of CXCR4 was high in the lung tissues of VILI rats. The overexpression of miR-9a-5p alleviated the degree of pathological injury in the lung tissues of rats with VILI, downregulating inflammatory cytokine expression and MPO activity. In the VILI rat model, miR-9a-5p targeted the negative regulation of CXCR4, and CXCR4 overexpression to reverse the lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of miR-9a-5p overexpression in VILI rats. miR-9a-5p also inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal receptor-activated kinase (ERK), a protein related to the MAPK signaling pathway, by downregulating CXCR4 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; miR-9a-5p can hinder the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and reduce inflammatory reactions and lung injury in VILI rats through the targeted regulation of CXCR4 expression. Therefore, miR-9a-5p could serve as an intervention target to supply a new strategy for the care of VILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Serine metabolism orchestrates macrophage polarization by regulating the IGF1-p38 axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36180780/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serine metabolism is reportedly involved in immune cell functions, but whether and how serine metabolism regulates macrophage polarization remain largely unknown. Here, we show that suppressing serine metabolism, either by inhibiting the activity of the key enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase in the serine biosynthesis pathway or by exogenous serine and glycine restriction, robustly enhances the polarization of interferon-γ-activated macrophages (M(IFN-γ)) but suppresses that of interleukin-4-activated macrophages (M(IL-4)) both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, serine metabolism deficiency increases the expression of IGF1 by reducing the promoter abundance of S-adenosyl methionine-dependent histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. IGF1 then activates the p38-dependent JAK-STAT1 axis to promote M(IFN-γ) polarization and suppress STAT6-mediated M(IL-4) activation. This study reveals a new mechanism by which serine metabolism orchestrates macrophage polarization and suggests the manipulation of serine metabolism as a therapeutic strategy for macrophage-mediated immune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene improves renal dysfunction in mice with aristolochic acid nephropathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene inhibits oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the kidney of mice with aristolochic acid nephropathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway is critical to inhibit the development of renal inflammatory response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene activates the Nrf2 antioxidant system and then inhibits apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lycopene (LYC) is a carotenoid, has antioxidant properties. This study investigated whether lycopene attenuates aristolochic acids (AAs) -induced chronic kidney disease. In this experiment, lycopene was used to intervene C57BL/6 mice with renal injury induced by aristolochic acid exposure. The histomorphological changes and serological parameters of the kidney were measured in order to assess the alleviating effect of lycopene on renal injury in aristolochic acid nephropathy. In vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to verify the main mechanism of action and drug targets of lycopene in improving aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) and by various experimental methods such as ELISA, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Western-blot and qRT-PCR. The results showed that oxidative stress injury was induced in the kidney of mice after AAI exposure, resulting in inflammatory response and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. The results showed that the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway was inhibited after AAI exposure. AAI induces oxidative stress injury in the kidney, which ultimately leads to inflammation and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. After LYC intervened in the body, it activated Nrf2 nuclear translocation and its downstream HO-1 and NQO1 antioxidant signaling pathways. LYC inhibited ROS production by renal tubular epithelial cells, and alleviated mitochondrial damage. LYC further modulated the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling cascade, thereby reduced the accumulation of inflammatory factors in the renal interstitium. Moreover, LYC was able to up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2, down-regulate Bax expression and inhibit the activation of cleaved forms of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3, which finally attenuated the apoptosis of the mitochondrial pathway induced by AAI exposure. It was concluded that lycopene was able to activate the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway to maintain the homeostasis of renal oxidative stress and ultimately attenuated renal inflammatory response and apoptosis. These results suggested that lycopene can be used as a drug to relieve AAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polysaccharides from &lt;em&gt;Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum&lt;/em&gt; Diels et Gilg (SYQP) attenuated LPS-induced ALI in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYQP exerted anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYQP alleviated ALI by inhibiting TLR4/COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum&lt;/em&gt; Diels et Gilg (Sanyeqing, SYQ), a traditional herb native to China, has been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, febrile convulsions and dysentery. Previous studies have demonstrated the hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects of polysaccharides from SYQ (SYQP). However, the role of SYQP in acute lung injury (ALI) remained unknown. Our present study aimed to explore the protective effects of SYQP in ALI and explained its underlying mechanism. In vivo, Balb/c mice were intragastrically administered with SYQP and dexamethasone (DXMS) for 14 days which were intratracheally instilled (IT) with LPS at the last day. In vitro, A549 cells were pretreated with SYQP, DXMS or TAK-242, following by LPS stimulation for 24 h. The histopathological results showed that SYQP remarkably alleviated pulmonary macrophage infiltration and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels. Additionally, SYQP evidently suppressed wet/dry (W/D) ratio of lung and white blood cells (WBC) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Moreover, SYQP markedly reduced TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and COX-2 levels both in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, SYQP significantly attenuated oxidative stress through upregulating the levels of SOD and GSH-Px and downregulating the expressions of MDA and LDH in vivo, which was confirmed by in vitro results that SYQP could increase SOD activity and decrease MDA and NO contents. Importantly, a decline in protein expressions of TLR4, COX-2, NF-κB p50, phospho-NF-κB p65 and phospho-IκB-α was detected in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our results demonstrated that SYQP ameliorated LPS-induced ALI by alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress via attenuating TLR4/COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are protected by their niche and are regulated by Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, and Notch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISCs and their relationship with intestinal microbiota provide a feasible pathway to alleviate intestinal diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diverse bacteria-related postbiotics regulate ISCs and maintain their homeostasis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intestinal epithelium undergoes rapid cellular turnover, relying on the local niche, to support intestinal stem cells (ISCs) function and self-renewal. Research into the association between ISCs and disease continues to expand at a rapid rate. However, the detailed interaction of ISCs and gut microbes remains to be elucidated. Thus, this review witnessed major advances in the crosstalk between ISCs and gut microbes, delivering key insights into (1) construction of ISC niche and molecular mechanism of how to jointly govern epithelial homeostasis and protect against intestinal diseases with the participation of Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, and Notch; (2) differentiation fate of ISCs affect the gut microbiota. Meanwhile, the presence of intestinal microbes also regulates ISC function; (3) microbiota regulation on ISCs by Wnt and Notch signals through pattern recognition receptors; (4) how do specific microbiota-related postbiotics influence ISCs to maintain intestinal epithelial regeneration and homeostasis that provide insights into a promising alternative therapeutic method for intestinal diseases. Considering the detailed interaction is still unclear, it is necessary to further explore the regulatory role of gut microbiota on ISCs to utilize microbes to alleviate gut disorders. Furthermore, these major advances collectively drive us ever closer to breakthroughs in regenerative medicine and cancer treatment by microbial transplantation in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibiting ALK-TOPK signaling pathway promotes cell apoptosis of ALK-positive NSCLC</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36167821/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-LAK cell-oriented protein kinase (TOPK) is a potential therapeutic target in tumors. However, its role in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been reported. Here, we found that TOPK was highly expressed in ALK-positive NSCLC. Additionally, ALK was identified as another upstream kinase of TOPK by in vitro kinase assay screening. Then, it was proven that ALK phosphorylated TOPK at Y74 in vitro and ex vivo, and the pathways downstream of ALK-TOPK were explored by phosphoproteomic analysis. Subsequently, we demonstrated that inhibiting TOPK enhanced tumor sensitivity to alectinib (an ALK inhibitor). The combination of alectinib and HI-032 (a TOPK inhibitor) suppressed the growth and promoted the apoptosis of ALK-positive NSCLC cells ex vivo and in vivo. Our findings reveal a novel ALK-TOPK signaling pathway in ALK-positive NSCLC. The combination of alectinib and HI-032 might be a promising therapeutic strategy for improving the sensitivity of ALK-positive NSCLC to targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selenium-enriched soybean peptides pretreatment attenuates lung injury in mice induced by fine particulate matters (PM2.5) through inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB/IκBα signaling pathway and inflammasome generation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35979800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to identify and prepare peptides from selenium (Se)-enriched soybeans and determine whether dietary Se-enriched soybean peptides (Se-SPep) could inhibit lung injury in mice induced by fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups. The mice in the prevention groups were pretreated with 378 mg kg-1 of Se-SPep, soybean peptides (SPep), and Se-enriched soybean protein (Se-SPro), respectively, for four weeks. The mice in the PM2.5 exposure group received concentrated PM2.5 (15 μg per day mice) for 1 h daily from the third week for two weeks. The results showed that the leukocyte and cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the PM2.5 exposure group were higher than those in the control group. Se-SPep pretreatment decreased the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels compared with the PM2.5 exposure group. Additionally, Se-SPep pretreatment inhibited TLR4/NF-κB/IκBα and NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 protein expression in the lungs. In conclusion, Se-SPep pretreatment may protect the lungs of the mice against PM2.5-induced inflammation, suggesting that Se-SPep represents a potential preventative agent to inhibit PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Hippo pathway and its correlation with acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36052554/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant clinical complication with a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality, for which therapeutic options remain limited. The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway implicated in cell proliferation, dedifferentiation, and apoptosis via phosphorylation and inactivation of its downstream effectors Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Recent studies have revealed that the Hippo pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and repair of AKI. The Hippo pathway can mediate renal dysfunction through modulation of mitochondrial apoptosis under AKI conditions. Transient activation of YAP/TAZ in the acute phase of AKI may benefit renal recovery and regeneration, whereas persistent activation of YAP/TAZ in severe AKI may lead to maladaptive repair and transition to chronic kidney disease. This review aims to summarize recent findings on the associations between the Hippo pathway and AKI and to identify new therapeutic targets and strategies for AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Na/K-ATPase suppresses LPS-induced pro-inflammatory signaling through Lyn</title>

&lt;li&gt;NKA α1 interacts with TLR4 and SFKs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1 restricts LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice injected with LPS show more lung injury and lower survival rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na/K-ATPase (NKA), besides its ion transporter function, is a signal transducer by regulating Src family kinases (SFK). The signaling NKA contributes to oxidized LDL-induced macrophage foam cell formation and interacts with TLR4. However, its role in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced signaling and glycolytic switch in macrophages remains unclear. Using peritoneal macrophages from NKA α1 haploinsufficient mice (NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;), we found that NKA α1 haploinsufficiency led to enhanced LPS-stimulated NF-κB pathway, ROS signaling, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS resulted in more severe lung inflammation and injury with lower survival rate in NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Additionally, LPS induced a higher extent of the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Mechanistically, NKA α1 interacted with TLR4 and Lyn. The presence of NKA α1 in this complex attenuated Lyn activation by LPS, which subsequently restricted the downstream ROS and NF-κB signaling. In conclusion, we demonstrated that NKA α1 suppresses LPS-induced macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling through Lyn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rectal administration of butyrate ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis in mice through induction of hepatocyte growth factor in the colon via the HDAC-PPARγ pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36116532/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butyrate, given by oral administration or in drinking water, has been shown to improve experimental pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in mice despite of very low bioavailability. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics disconnection attracts us to explore its anti-PF mechanism in view of the intestinal expression of anti-PF factors. In bleomycin-induced PF in mice, rectal administration of butyrate (500 mg/kg) exhibited a significant anti-PF effect, with a maximum plasma concentration largely lower than the minimum effective concentration (1 mM) at which butyrate inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory factors by lung epithelial cells and the production of extracellular matrix by lung fibroblasts. The rectal administration of butyrate significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the colons of PF mice, but showed no significant effect on the mRNA expression of HGF in the small intestines, lungs and livers. In colon epithelial cells, the monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHC) abrogated butyrate-induced expression of HGF, indicating that butyrate functions through entering into cells. Butyrate showed no significant effect on the histone acetylation in the promoter region of HGF, suggesting that it promotes HGF expression not by directly affecting the histone deacetylation of HGF but by other pathways. GW9662, the inhibitor of PPARγ, significantly attenuated the effect of butyrate to promote the mRNA expression of HGF. Butyrate was able to enhance the acetylation of PPARγ, and a targeted mutation of lysine at the position 240 (K240) of PPARγ markedly diminished the induction of butyrate on HGF expression, suggesting that butyrate promoted HGF expression in colon epithelial cells by upregulating PPARγ K240 acetylation. In summary, rectal administration of butyrate promotes the expression of HGF in colonic epithelial cells through upregulating PPARγ acetylation via inhibition of HDAC activity. The findings of the present study provide a reasonable explanation for the anti-PF action mode of butyrate based on the &amp;rsquo;lung-gut axis&amp;rsquo;, and found that intestine-derived butyrate and HGF may be involved in the modulation of the occurrence and progression of PF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astragaloside IV regulates the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to inhibit PM2.5-mediated lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36115280/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5-induced lung injury was associated with the ferroptosis and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV pre-treatment attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury by inhibiting ferroptosis via Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV is a potential drug for prevention of PM2.5-induced respiratory disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Exposure to PM2.5 will increase the risk of respiratory disease and increase the burden of social health care. Astragaloside Ⅳ (Ast-IV) is one of the main biologically active substances form Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus, which owns various pharmacological effects. Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by accumulation of iron-dependent lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is not clear whether there are typical features of ferroptosis in PM2.5-induced lung injury. This study investigates whether PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice has a special form of ferroptosis and the specific protective mechanism of Ast-IV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjects and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Forty-two male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 7 per group): NS group (normal saline), Ast group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg), PM2.5 group, Ast-L group (Ast-IV 50 mg/kg + PM2.5), Ast-H group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + PM2.5) and Era group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + erastin 20 mg/kg + PM2.5). Mice were pre-treated with Ast-IV intraperitoneally for three days. Then, PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) was given by non-invasive tracheal instillation to induce lung injury. The ferroptosis&amp;rsquo; agonist erastin was used to verify the mechanism of Ast-IV anti-ferroptosis. 12 h after PM2.5 stimulation, the mice were euthanized. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum were collected for oxidative stress and cytokine determination. Lung tissues were collected for glutathione (GSH), tissue iron content, histology, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Ast-IV reduced the lung wet-dry ratio and the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in serum. Ast-IV could also improve the oxidative stress level in BALF, restore the GSH level in the lung tissue, and reduce the iron content in the lung tissue. Western blot outcomes revealed that Ast-IV regulated the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to protect PM2.5-mediated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The protective effect of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice might be related to the inhibition of ferroptosis in lung tissue. Anti-ferroptosis might be a new mechanism of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier, resulting in severe alveolar edema and inflammation. D-tagatose (TAG) is a low-calorie fructose isomer with diverse biological activities whose role in ARDS has never been explored. We found that TAG protects lung tissues from injury in the oleic acid-induced rat model of ARDS. Seventeen male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups: Sham (n = 5), ARDS (n = 6), and TAG + ARDS (n = 6). The treatment groups were injected with oleic acid to induce ARDS, and the TAG + ARDS group was given TAG 3 days before the induction. After the treatments, the effect of TAG was evaluated by blood gas analysis and observing the gross and histological structure of the lung. The results showed that TAG significantly improved the oxygenation function, reduced the respiratory acidosis and the inflammatory response. TAG also improved the vascular permeability in ARDS rats and promoted the differentiation of alveolar type II cells, maintaining the stability of the alveolar structure. This protective effect of TAG on the lung may be achieved by activating the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, TAG protects against oleic acid-induced ARDS in rats, suggesting a new clinical strategy for treating the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial DNA mediates immunoparalysis of dendritic cells in sepsis via STING signalling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36106559/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a potent activator for pro-inflammatory response. Dendritic cells (DCs) are immunosuppressed in sepsis, whether mtDNA mediates immunoparalysis in sepsis remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The mRNAs were assessed by qPCR. Flow cytometry was used to measure the expression of costimulatory molecules and the proliferation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to analyse the expression of proteins. Cytokine secretion was detected by ELISA. Histology of lung tissue was used to assess the inflammatory injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia increased plasma mtDNA levels and immunoparalysis of spleen DCs, while hydrolysing mtDNA reversed immunoparalysis of spleen DCs in vivo. Moreover, cytoplasmic mtDNA of DCs was accumulated in endotoxemia and sepsis. mtDNA transfection into bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) inhibited the expression of costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD40, CD80 and CD86) and the release of IL-12p70, while increasing the secretion of IL-10. Cytoplasmic mtDNA also inhibited the ability of BMDCs to promote the proliferation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Mechanistic analysis revealed that STING signalling was required for mtDNA-mediated immunoparalysis of DCs in vivo and in vitro. Further studies showed deletion of STING reversed mtDNA-mediated immunoparalysis of DCs and improved the prognosis of endotoxemia and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results demonstrated that mtDNA promotes immunoparalysis of DCs, and contributes to sepsis-associated immunosuppression by activating STING signalling. Our study may provide new insights to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of immunosuppressive DCs in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin ameliorates LPS-induced acute lung injury by maintenance of pulmonary microvascular barrier via activating the Epac1/AKT pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36115114/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin alleviates LPS-induced pulmonary injury and edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin protects against PMVECs hyperpermeability via preventing the loss of adherens junctions and tight junctions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress by regulating mitochondrial function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin attenuates PMVECs barrier dysfunction via activating the Epac1/AKT signaling axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) barrier dysfunction is a main pathophysiological feature of sepsis-related acute lung injury (ALI). This study aimed to investigate whether the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor linagliptin could protect against LPS-induced PMVECs barrier disruption and its underlying molecular mechanisms. A classical ALI animal model and LPS-treated PMVECs were applied and all were treated with or without linagliptin. Cellular experiments demonstrated that linagliptin could mitigate LPS-induced PMVECs hyperpermeability and intercellular junction (VE-cadherin, β-catenin, and ZO-1) disruption in a dose-dependent manner. Correspondingly, it was observed that linagliptin pretreatment distinctly relieved LPS-induced lung injury, oxidative stress, and pulmonary edema in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of oxidative stress by linagliptin may be achieved by reversing impaired mitochondrial function. Mechanistically, linagliptin administration promoted the activation of the Epac1 pathway and its downstream AKT pathway, while inhibition of the Epac1/Akt signaling pathway significantly alleviated the above-mentioned protective effect of linagliptin on the PMVECs barrier. Taken together, these data suggest that linagliptin can effectively reserve PMVECs barrier dysfunction and inhibit oxidative stress to protect against ALI via activating the Epac1/AKT signaling pathway, and thus may become a potential clinical therapeutic strategy for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wnt5a/β-catenin axis is involved in the downregulation of AT2 lineage by PAI-1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to regenerate injured alveoli functionally and promptly causes a high incidence of fatality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). How elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) regulates the lineage of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells for re-alveolarization has not been studied. This study aimed to examine the role of PAI-1-Wnt5a-β catenin cascades in AT2 fate. Dramatic reduction in AT2 yield was observed in &lt;em&gt;Serpine1&lt;sup&gt;Tg&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Elevated PAI-1 level suppressed organoid number, development efficiency, and total surface area in vitro. Anti-PAI-1 neutralizing antibody restored organoid number, proliferation and differentiation of AT2 cells, and β-catenin level in organoids. Both Wnt family member 5A (Wnt5a) and Wnt5a-derived N-butyloxycarbonyl hexapeptide (Box5) altered the lineage of AT2 cells. This study demonstrates that elevated PAI-1 regulates AT2 proliferation and differentiation via the Wnt5a/β catenin cascades. PAI-1 could serve as autocrine signaling for lung injury repair.

      <title>Pretreatment with rosavin attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats through antiferroptosis via PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36097321/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation and oxidative stress caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increase the incidence and mortality rates of respiratory disorders. Rosavin is the main chemical component of Rhodiola plants, which exerts anti-oxidative and antiinflammatory effects. In this research, the potential therapeutic effect of rosavin was investigated by the PM2.5-induced lung injury rat model. Rats were instilled with PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) suspension intratracheally, while rosavin (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) was delivered by intraperitoneal injection before the PM2.5 injection. It was observed that rosavin could prevent lung injury caused by PM2.5. PM2.5 showed obvious ferroptosis-related ultrastructural alterations, which were significantly corrected by rosavin. The pretreatment with rosavin downregulated the levels of tissue iron, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal, and increased the levels of glutathione. The expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was upregulated by rosavin, together with other ferroptosis-related proteins. RSL3, a specific ferroptosis agonist, reversed the beneficial impact of rosavin. The network pharmacology approach predicted the activation of rosavin on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. LY294002, a potent PI3K inhibitor, decreased the upregulation of Nrf2 induced by rosavin. In conclusion, rosavin prevented lung injury induced by PM2.5 stimulation and suppressed ferroptosis via upregulating PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>H1N1 influenza virus dose dependent induction of dysregulated innate immune responses and STAT1/3 activation are associated with pulmonary immunopathological damage</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36082929/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infection poses a substantial challenge and causes high morbidity and mortality. Exacerbated pulmonary inflammatory responses are the major causes of extensive diffuse alveolar immunopathological damage. However, the relationship between the extent of cytokine storm, neutrophils/macrophages infiltration, and different IAV infection dose and time still needs to be further elucidated, and it is still unclear whether the signal transduction and transcriptional activator 1/3 (STAT1/3) signalling pathway plays a beneficial or detrimental role. Here, we established a mouse model of high- and low-dose pH1N1 infection. We found that pH1N1 infection induced robust and early pathological damage and cytokine storm in an infection dose- and time-dependent manner. High-dose pH1N1 infection induced massive and sustained recruitment of neutrophils as well as a higher ratio of M1:M2, which may contribute to severe lung immunopathological damage. pH1N1 infection activated dose- and time-dependent STAT1 and STAT3. Inhibition of STAT1 and/or STAT3 aggravated low-dose pH1N1 infection, induced lung damage, and decreased survival rate. Appropriate activation of STAT1/3 provided survival benefits and pathological improvement during low-dose pH1N1 infection. These results demonstrate that high-dose pH1N1 infection induces robust and sustained neutrophil infiltration, imbalanced macrophage polarization, excessive and earlier cytokine storm, and STAT1/3 activation, which are associated with pulmonary dysregulated proinflammatory responses and progress of acute lung injury. The severe innate immune responses may be the threshold at which protective functions give way to immunopathology, and assessing the magnitude of host innate immune responses is necessary in adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy for alleviating influenza-induced pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulator of calcineurin 1 deletion attenuates mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in acute kidney injury through JNK/Mff signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36071051/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced acute kidney injury (AKI), characterized by excessive mitochondrial damage and cell apoptosis, remains a clinical challenge. Recent studies suggest that regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) regulates mitochondrial function in different cell types, but the underlying mechanisms require further investigation. Herein, we aim to explore whether RCAN1 involves in mitochondrial dysfunction in AKI and the exact mechanism. In present study, AKI was induced by I/R and cisplatin in RCAN1flox/flox mice and mice with renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs)-specific deletion of RCAN1. The role of RCAN1 in hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) and cisplatin-induced injury in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2 was also examined by overexpression and knockdown of RCAN1. Mitochondrial function was assessed by transmission electron microscopy, JC-1 staining, MitoSOX staining, ATP production, mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay, Annexin V-FITC staining and Western blotting analysis of apoptosis-related proteins. It was found that protein expression of RCAN1 was markedly upregulated in I/R- or cisplatin-induced AKI mouse models, as well as in HR models in HK-2 cells. RCAN1 deficiency significantly reduced kidney damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell apoptosis, whereas RCAN1 overexpression led to the opposite phenotypes. Our in-depth mechanistic exploration demonstrated that RCAN1 increases the phosphorylation of mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) by binding to downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), then promotes dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) migration to mitochondria, ultimately leads to excessive mitochondrial fission of renal TECs. In conclusion, our study suggests that RCAN1 could induce mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis by activating the downstream JNK/Mff signaling pathway. RCAN1 may be a potential therapeutic target for conferring protection against I/R- or cisplatin-AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles from colorectal cancer cells promote metastasis via the NOD1 signalling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36068649/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) have been shown to promote tumour metastasis via sensing tumour cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (EVs). Nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain 1 (NOD1), a cytoplasmic PRR, plays a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) by detecting bacterial products. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of NOD1, following identification of CRC cell-derived EVs (CRC-EVs), to potentiate CRC liver metastasis (CRC-LM), remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that CRC-EVs activate NOD1 in macrophages to initiate secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. NOD1-activated macrophages also promote CRC cell migration, while in a murine model of liver metastasis (LM), NOD1-deficient mice exhibit reduced metastasis following CRC-EV treatment. Furthermore, cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), a small Rho guanosine-5&amp;rsquo;-triphosphate (GTP)ase, is delivered by CRC-EVs into macrophages where it activates NOD1. In addition, EVs from the plasma of patients with CRC-LM mediate NOD1 activation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, high NOD1 expression in tumour tissues is associated with poor prognosis of CRC-LM. Our findings suggest that CRC-EVs activate NOD1 to promote tumour metastasis, thus, NOD1 may serve as a potential target in the diagnosis and treatment of CRC-LM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NAT10 regulates neutrophil pyroptosis in sepsis via acetylating ULK1 RNA and activating STING pathway</title>

&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04045-w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;NAT10 regulates neutrophil pyroptosis in sepsis via acetylating ULK1 RNA and activating STING pathway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence suggests that pyroptosis is involved in sepsis. However, the role of neutrophil pyroptosis in sepsis and the mechanisms remains elusive. We find that N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), an acetyltransferase responsible for the N4-acetylation of Cytidine (ac4C) in mRNA, is significantly downregulated in neutrophils from septic mice. Neutrophil-specific over-expression of NAT10 improves the survival and ameliorates lung injury in septic mice by inhibiting neutrophil pyroptosis. Notably, UNC-52-like kinase 1 (ULK1) is identified as the target of NAT10 in neutrophils. The decreased expression of NAT10 resultes in the decay of ULK1 transcripts and therefore the reduced expression of ULK1. As a regulator of STING phosphorylation, the loss of ULK1 enhances the activation of STING-IRF3 signaling and subsequently the elevated pyroptosis-inducing NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils. While over-expression of NAT10 restrains pyroptosis in neutrophils as well as septic lethality in mice by reversing the ULK1-STING-NLRP3 axis. The decreased expression of NAT10 are also observed in sepsis patients and its correlation with clinical severity is found. Collectively, our findings disclose that NAT10 is a negative regulator of neutrophil pyroptosis and its downregulation contributes to the progress of sepsis by exacerbating pyroptosis via the ULK1-STING-NLRP3 axis, therefore revealing a potential therapeutic target for sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the cGAS-STING Pathway Attenuates Lung Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via Regulating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Alveolar Epithelial Type II Cells of Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36091334/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosol dsDNA sensor, coupling with downstream stimulator of interferon genes (STING) located in the ER, which involves innate immune responses. The aim of our present study was to investigate the effects of cGAS on lung I/R injury via regulating ERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used Sprague-Dawley rats to make the lung I/R model by performing left hilum occlusion-reperfusion surgery. cGAS-specific inhibitor RU.521, STING agonist SR-717, and 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), the ERS inhibitor, were intraperitoneally administered in rats. Double immunofluorescent staining was applied to detect the colocalization of cGAS or BiP, an ERS protein, with alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECIIs) marker. We used transmission electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructure of ER and mitochondria. Apoptosis and oxidative stress in the lungs were assessed, respectively. The profiles of pulmonary edema and lung tissue injury were evaluated. And the pulmonary ventilation function was measured using a spirometer system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In lung I/R rats, the cGAS-STING pathway was upregulated, which implied they were activated. After cGAS-STING pathway was inhibited or activated in lung I/R rats, the ERS was alleviated after cGAS was inhibited, while when STING was activated after lung I/R, ERS was aggravated in the AECIIs, these results suggested that cGAS-STING pathway might trigger ERS responses. Furthermore, activation of cGAS-STING pathway induced increased apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress via regulating ERS and therefore resulted in pulmonary edema and pathological injury in the lungs of I/R rats. Inhibition of cGAS-STING pathway attenuated ERS, therefore attenuated lung injury and promoted pulmonary ventilation function in I/R rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway attenuates lung ischemia/reperfusion injury via alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress in alveolar epithelial type II cells of rats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phenotypic drug screen uncovers the metabolic GCH1/BH4 pathway as key regulator of EGFR/KRAS-mediated neuropathic pain and lung cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) generated in injured sensory neurons contributes to increased pain sensitivity and its persistence. GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo BH4 synthetic pathway, and human single-nucleotide polymorphism studies, together with mouse genetic modeling, have demonstrated that decreased GCH1 leads to both reduced BH4 and pain. However, little is known about the regulation of &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression upon nerve injury and whether this could be modulated as an analgesic therapeutic intervention. We performed a phenotypic screen using about 1000 bioactive compounds, many of which are target-annotated FDA-approved drugs, for their effect on regulating &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression in rodent injured dorsal root ganglion neurons. From this approach, we uncovered relevant pathways that regulate &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression in sensory neurons. We report that EGFR/KRAS signaling triggers increased &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression and contributes to neuropathic pain; conversely, inhibiting EGFR suppressed GCH1 and BH4 and exerted analgesic effects, suggesting a molecular link between EGFR/KRAS and pain perception. We also show that GCH1/BH4 acts downstream of KRAS to drive lung cancer, identifying a potentially druggable pathway. Our screen shows that pharmacologic modulation of GCH1 expression and BH4 could be used to develop pharmacological treatments to alleviate pain and identified a critical role for EGFR-regulated GCH1/BH4 expression in neuropathic pain and cancer in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poldip2 knockdown protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via Nox4/Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36120334/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymerase δ-interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) has been reported to mediate acute lung injury (ALI); however, the underlying mechanism is not fully explored. Male C57BL/6 mice and A549 cells were used to establish the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model, then the expression of Poldip2 and its effect on oxidative stress and the resulting inflammation were detected. Adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) mediated Poldip2 knockdown was transfected into mice via intratracheal atomization. And A549 cells stimulated with LPS was used to further confirm our hypothesis in vitro. ML385, specifically inhibited the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Our data suggested that LPS stimulation remarkably increased protein levels of Nox4 and p-P65, activities of NADPH and MPO, and generation of ROS, TNF-α, and IL-1β while decreased protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 compared with those in NC shRNA + Saline group, which were obviously reversed by Poldip2 knockdown. Concomitantly, Poldip2 knockdown dramatically reduced contents of MDA and enhanced activities of SOD and GSH-Px compared to NC shRNA + LPS group. In vitro, we found that knockdown of Poldip2 significantly reversed LPS-induced increase protein levels of Nox4 and p-P65, activity of NADPH, and generation of ROS, TNF-α, and IL-1β, and decrease protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1, ML385 pretreatment reversed the effects of Poldip2 knockdown mentioned above. Our study indicated that Poldip2 knockdown alleviates LPS-induced ALI via inhibiting Nox4/Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diacerein attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ER stress and apoptosis: Impact on the crosstalk between SphK1/S1P, TLR4/NFκB/STAT3, and NLRP3/IL-1β signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36055546/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening clinical problem with high mortality rate and limited treatments or preventive options that represents a major challenge for clinicians. Diacerein (DIA) is a multi-target anthraquinone derivative with potent anti-inflammatory action. The aim of this study is to assess the protective effect of DIA and its potential molecular targets against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administrated DIA (50 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (5mg/kg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; DIA mitigated oxidative lung injury in LPS-challenged rats via significantly decreasing lung wet/dry (W/D) ratio, inflammatory cells infiltration, and lipid peroxidation, with concomitant elevation in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels in lung tissue. Likewise, DIA alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress and markedly halted inflammation triggered by LPS challenge in pulmonary tissue by suppressing NLRP3/IL-1β and TLR4/NF-κB signaling with parallel decrease in proinflammatory cytokine levels. Interestingly, DIA down regulated Sphk1/S1P axis, reduced GSK-3β and STAT3 proteins expression, and markedly decreased caspase-3 besides increasing Bcl-2 levels in lung tissue of LPS-challenged animals. These biochemical findings was simultaneously associated with marked improvement in histological alterations of lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; These findings verify the protective effect of DIA against LPS-induced ALI through targeting oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis. Importantly, DIA halted the hyperinflammatory state triggered by LPS via multi-faceted inhibitory effect on different signaling pathways, hence DIA could potentially reduce mortality in patients with ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pyrogallol enhances therapeutic effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells against LPS-mediated inflammation and lung injury via activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028178/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenges in clinical applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attributed to their heterogeneity. It is believed that preconditioning of MSCs with active compounds may enhance the expression of potentially therapeutic molecules and thus achieve stable and effective therapeutic outcomes. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which pyrogallol increased the therapeutic efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) against LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI). hUCMSCs with pyrogallol treatment increased expression of HO-1 at both mRNA and protein levels, accompanied by Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1 (Keap1) degradation, and upregulation of the Nrf2 protein levels as well as nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Moreover, the modulation of Keap1 and Nrf2 as well as HO-1 upregulation by pyrogallol was reversed by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and a P38 kinase inhibitor (SB203580). Whereas, NAC pretreatment abrogated pyrogallol-mediated activation of P38 kinase, indicating that pyrogallol-derived ROS led to P38 kinase activation, thus promoting Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Additionally, we found that the induction of p62 by the pyrogallol-mediated ROS/P38/Nrf2 axis interacted with Keap1 and resulted in autophagic degradation of Keap1, which created a positive feedback loop to further release of Nrf2. Furthermore, the increased expression of HO-1 in pyrogallol-pretreated hUCMSCs led to enhanced inhibitory effects on LPS-mediated TLR4/P-P65 signaling in BEAS-2B cells, resulting in increasing suppression of LPS-indued expression of a series of pro-inflammatory mediators. Compared to untreated hUCMSCs, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with pyrogallol-primed hUCMSCs transplantation showed enhanced improvements in LPS-mediated lung pathological alterations, the increased lung index (lung/body ratio), apoptosis of epithelial cells, the activation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling as well as the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Together, these results suggested that hUCMSCs with pyrogallol pretreatment enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSCs, which may provide a promising therapeutic strategy to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSC-based therapy for treating LPS-associated ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting Myocardial Mitochondria-STING-Polyamine Axis Prevents Cardiac Hypertrophy in Chronic Kidney Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36061341/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitochondrial damage is early and prominent in cardiomyocytes under CKD milieu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitochondrial damage stimulates myocardial STING-NFκB pathway to drive hypertrophy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFκB transactivates ODC1-PUT metabolic flux in cardiomyocytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ODC1-PUT metabolic flux is required for STING/NFκB-driven cardiac hypertrophy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting mitochondria-STING-ODC1 axis prevents cardiac hypertrophy in CKD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is well recognized as a distinct contributor to cardiac hypertrophy, while the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, the authors show that myocardial mitochondrial oxidative damage is early and prominent in CKD and distinctively stimulates the STING-NFκB pathway by releasing mitochondrial DNA to drive cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, the authors reveal that ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1)-putrescine metabolic flux is transactivated by NFκB and is required for the STING-NFκB pathway to drive cardiac hypertrophy. Finally, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the myocardial mitochondria-STING-NFκB-ODC1 axis significantly prevents CKD-associated cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, targeting the myocardial mitochoandria-STING-NFκB-ODC1 axis is a promising therapeutic strategy for cardiac hypertrophy in patients with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypoxia-induced lncRNA STEAP3-AS1 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote colorectal cancer progression by preventing m6A-mediated degradation of STEAP3 mRNA</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35986274/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35986274/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Hypoxia, a typical hallmark of solid tumors, exhibits an essential role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), in which the dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is frequently observed. However, the underlying mechanisms are not clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The TCGA database was analyzed to identify differential lncRNA expression involved in hypoxia-induced CRC progression. qRT-PCR was conducted to validate the upregulation of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; in CRC cell lines and tumor-bearing mouse and zebrafish models under hypoxia. ChIP-qRT-PCR was used to detect the transcriptional activation of STEAP3-AS1 mediated by HIF-1α. RNA-seq, fluorescent in situ hybridization, RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and immunoblot experiments were used to ascertain the involved mechanisms. Functional assays were performed in both in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the regulatory role of &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt;/STEAP3/Wnt/β-catenin axis in CRC proliferation and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Here, we identified a hypoxia-induced antisense lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; that was highly expressed in clinical CRC tissues and positively correlated with poor prognosis of CRC patients. Upregulation of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt;, which was induced by HIF-1α-mediated transcriptional activation, facilitated the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; interacted competitively with the YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2), a N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) reader, leading to the disassociation of YTHDF2 with &lt;em&gt;STEAP3&lt;/em&gt; mRNA. This effect protected &lt;em&gt;STEAP3&lt;/em&gt; mRNA from m6A-mediated degradation, enabling the high expression of STEAP3 protein and subsequent production of cellular ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). Increased Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels elevated Ser 9 phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and inhibited its kinase activity, thus releasing β-catenin for nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of Wnt signaling to support CRC progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Taken together, our study highlights the mechanisms of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; in facilitating CRC progression involving the &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt;/STEAP3/Wnt/β-catenin axis, which may provide novel diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets to benefit CRC treatment. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1α transcriptionally upregulates the expression of lncRNA STEAP3-AS1, which interacts competitively with YTHDF2, thus upregulating mRNA stability of STEAP3 and consequent STEAP3 protein expression. The enhanced STEAP3 expression results in production of cellular ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), which induces the Ser 9 phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β, releasing β-catenin for nuclear translocation and contributing to subsequent activation of Wnt signaling to promote CRC progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eupalinolide B attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury through inhibition of NF-κB and MAPKs signaling by targeting TAK1 protein</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35988521/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eupalinolide B (EB) inhibit LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EB directly binds to TAK1, and inhibits NF-κB and MAPKs activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The α,γ-unsaturated lactone of EB is vital for its anti-inflammatory effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease characterized by severe inflammatory response, which has no pharmacological therapy in clinic. In this study, we found that eupalinolide B (EB), a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Eupatorium lindleyanum, significantly ameliorated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice, which manifests as reduction in lung injury score, activity of myeloperoxidase, and release of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In RAW264.7 murine macrophages, EB effectively inhibited LPS-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by down-regulating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), respectively. Mechanistically, EB not only blocked LPS-induced phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase-α/β (IKKα/β), phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B alpha (IκBα), and phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) P65, but also suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Through cellular thermal shift assay and western blotting, EB was demonstrated to target and inactivate transforming growth factor β activated kinase-1 (TAK1), which is an important upstream kinase for the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs pathways. Additionally, EB-mediated actions were markedly abolished by dithiothreitol in LPS-exposed RAW264.7 cells, suggesting a crucial role of the α,γ-unsaturated lactone for the anti-inflammatory activity of EB. In conclusion, our findings showed that EB could effectively alleviate ALI in mice, and attenuate inflammatory response by inhibiting the activation of TAK1, and TAK1-mediated activation of NF-κB and MAPKs cascades.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oxypeucedanin relieves LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the inflammation and maintaining the integrity of the lung air-blood barrier</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35985771/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is commonly accompanied by a severe inflammatory reaction process, and effectively managing inflammatory reactions is an important therapeutic approach for alleviating ALI. Macrophages play an important role in the inflammatory response, and this role is proinflammatory in the early stages of inflammation and anti-inflammatory in the late stages. Oxypeucedanin is a natural product with a wide range of pharmacological functions. This study aimed to determine the effect of oxypeucedanin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the following experiments were performed based on LPS-induced models &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Using myeloperoxidase activity measurement, ELISA, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting, we found that oxypeucedanin modulated the activity of myeloperoxidase and decreased the expression levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, MPO, COX-2 and iNOS in LPS-induced inflammation models. Meanwhile, oxypeucedanin inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT and its downstream NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, oxypeucedanin significantly decreased the pulmonary vascular permeability, which was induced by LPSs, and the enhanced expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin and Claudin 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of oxypeucedanin is associated with the inhibition of the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways and the maintenance of the integrity of the lung air-blood barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-192-5p/RB1/NF-κBp65 signaling axis promotes IL-10 secretion during gastric cancer EMT to induce Treg cell differentiation in the tumour microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35969010/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Regulatory T (Treg) cells are important components of the tumour microenvironment (TME) that play roles in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. Although tumour cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulate Treg cell function, their regulatory mechanism in GC remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The miR-192-5p was identified by examining three Gene Expression Omnibus GC miRNA expression datasets. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted to identify interactions between miR-192-5p and RB1. The role of miR-192-5p/RB1 in GC progression was evaluated based on EdU incorporation, wound healing and Transwell assays. An in vitro co-culture assay was performed to measure the effect of miR-192-5p/RB1 on Treg cell differentiation. In vivo experiments were conducted to explore the role of miR-192-5p in GC progression and Treg cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MiR-192-5p was overexpressed in tumour and was associated with poor prognosis in GC. MiR-192-5p bound to the RB1 3&amp;rsquo;-untranslated region, resulting in GC EMT, proliferation, migration and invasion. MiR-192-5p/RB1 mediated interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion by regulating nuclear factor-kappaBp65 (NF-κBp65), affecting Treg cell differentiation. NF-κBp65, in turn, promoted miR-192-5p expression and formed a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that miR-192-5p/RB1 promotes GC growth and Treg cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, our studies indicate that miR-192-5p/RB1 promotes EMT of tumour cells, and the miR-192-5p/RB1/NF-κBp65 signaling axis induces Treg cell differentiation by regulating IL-10 secretion in GC. Our results suggest that targeting miR-192-5p/RB1/NF-κBp65 /IL-10 may pave the way for the development of new immune treatments for GC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zanubrutinib ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via regulating macrophage polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35973369/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zanubrutinib could relieve LPS induced lung injuries in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway is involved in Zanubrutinib -mediated M1 macrophage polarization in RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zanubrutinib promotes M2 macrophage activation through regulating JAK/STAT6 and PI3K/AKT pathway in RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a disease characterized by pulmonary diffusion dysfunction and its exacerbation stage is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may develop to multiple organ failure and seriously threatens human health. ALI has high mortality rates and few effective treatments, thus effective protection measures for ALI are becoming increasingly important. Macrophages play a key regulatory role in the pathogenesis of ALI, and the degree of macrophage polarization is closely related to the severity and prognosis of ALI. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Zanubrutinib (ZB), a BTK small molecule inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of cell lymphoma, on macrophage polarization and acute lung injury. In the in vivo study, we constructed a mouse model of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury and found that ZB could improve the acute injury of mouse lungs by inhibiting the secretion of proinflammatory factors and promoting the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, reduce the number of inflammatory cells in alveolar lavage fluid, and then alleviate the inflammatory response. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that ZB could inhibit the M1 macrophage polarization and promote the M2 macrophage polarization. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that ZB could inhibit the macrophage M1 polarization via targeting BTK activation and inhibiting JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways, and promote the macrophage M2 polarization by promoting the activation of STAT6 and PI3K / Akt signaling pathways. In summary, ZB has shown therapeutic effect in LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, which provides a potential candidate drug to treat acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CircSV2b participates in oxidative stress regulation through miR-5107-5p-Foxk1-Akt1 axis in Parkinson&#39;s disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35973363/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircSV2b in serum exosomes can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircSV2b participates in the progress of PD through the ceRNA-Akt1 axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircSV2b overexpression is neuroprotective by resisting oxidative stress injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foxk1 can regulate Akt1 transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a novel type of non-coding RNAs, covalently closed circular RNAs (circRNAs) are ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes. Emerging studies have indicated that dysregulation of circRNAs was related to neurological diseases. However, the biogenesis, regulation, function, and mechanism of circRNAs in Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) remain largely unclear. In this study, thirty-three differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) were detected by RNA-sequencing between the MPTP-induced PD mice model and the wild-type mice. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the RNA level of DECs in the striatum (STR), substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and serum exosomes, and it was found that circSV2b was downregulated in PD mice. Then, functional experiments in vivo were employed to explore the effect of circSV2b in PD. For the mechanism study, dual-luciferase reporter, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull-down, gene editing, and CUT &amp;amp; Tag were performed in vitro to confirm that circSV2b directly sponged miR-5107-5p and alleviated the suppression of the expression of the target gene Foxk1, and then positively regulated Akt1 transcription. In vivo, the mechanistic analysis demonstrated that circSV2b overexpression resisted oxidative stress damage through the ceRNA-Akt1 axis in PD models. Taken together, these findings suggested that the miR-5107-5p-Foxk1-Akt1 axis might serve as a key target of circSV2b overexpression in PD treatment, and highlighted the significant change of circSV2b in serum exosomes. Therefore, circSV2b might be a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chlorogenic Acid Prevents Hyperuricemia Nephropathy via Regulating TMAO-Related Gut Microbes and Inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35950815/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperuricemia is an independent hazard factor of renal injury and can induce renal fibrosis, promoting the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to explore the probability of chlorogenic acid (CGA) as a potential substance for preventing hyperuricemia nephropathy (HN). Pretreatment with CGA downregulated SUA, BUN, and CR levels, relieved oxidative stress and inflammatory response, alleviated kidney fibrosis, and contributed to the prevention of HN. In the gut microbiota, &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Faecalibaculum&lt;/em&gt; related to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) synthesis were significantly increased in HN rats. In addition, it showed a significant increase in serum TMAO content in HN rats. However, CGA regulated the cascade response of the microbiota-TMAO signaling to reverse the increase of serum TMAO. CGA also decreased the protein expression of protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by reducing the production of TMAO. CGA delayed kidney fibrosis in HN rats as evidenced by regulating the cascade response of the microbiota-TMAO-PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In summary, CGA can be an excellent candidate for HN prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of the key ferroptosis-related genes involved in sepsis progression and experimental validation in vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36188533/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36188533/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ferroptosis has a vital role in sepsis, but the mechanism is not known. Understanding the mechanism of ferroptosis during sepsis will aid in developing improved therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used the Gene Expression Omnibus database and FerrDb database to obtain ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between sepsis patients and healthy volunteers (HVs). Analyses of PPI networks, functional enrichment, as well as use of the MCODE algorithm were used to identify key ferroptosis-related DEGs. Expression of key ferroptosis-related DEGs was verified using: GSE57065 and GSE65682 datasets; rats in which ferroptosis was induced with erastin; sepsis-induced acute lung injury (siALI) rats. The effects of acupoint catgut embedding (ACE) on ferroptosis and expression of key ferroptosis-related DEGs in the lungs of siALI rats were also observed. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to verify the effect of key ferroptosis-related DEGs on the survival of sepsis patients. Cytoscape was used to construct ceRNA networks and gene-transcription factor networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Between sepsis patients and HVs, we identified 33 ferroptosis-related DEGs. According to analyses of PPI networks and the MCODE algorithm, we obtained four modules, of which the most significant module contained nine ferroptosis-related DEGs. Functional-enrichment analyses showed that four of the nine DEGs were enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway: &lt;em&gt;MAPK14&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;VEGFA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TGFBR1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DUSP1&lt;/em&gt;. We verified expression of these four genes in GSE57065 and GSE65682 datasets and ferroptosis rats. In addition, expression of these four genes and that of the oxidative-stress indicators GSSG and MDA was upregulated, and glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4) expression was downregulated, in siALI rats, but ACE reversed these changes. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that survival of sepsis patients in the high-risk group was shorter than that in the low-risk group. We found that the XIST-hsa-let-7b-5p-TGFBR1/DUSP1 ceRNA network and transcription factor E2F1 may be important regulators of these four DEGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results suggest that &lt;em&gt;MAPK14&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;VEGFA,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;TGFBR1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DUSP1&lt;/em&gt; may be key regulatory targets of ferroptosis in sepsis, and that ACE pretreatment may be antioxidant treatment for sepsis and alleviate ferroptosis. These findings provide a basis for further ferroptosis-related study in sepsis and provide new targets for its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autoinducer-2 promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36033859/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that causes various acute and chronic lung infections in immunocompromised patients. We previously found that a quorum sensing (QS) signal, namely, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), facilitates the pathogenicity of the wild-type (WT) &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 strain &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. However, the immunological mechanism that leads to pulmonary injury remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of AI-2 on interleukin-17A (IL-17A) production during acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 lung infection using a mouse model, with an emphasis on the underlying immunological mechanism. Compared to infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 alone, infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 combined with AI-2 treatment resulted in significantly increased levels of IL-17A, numbers of Th17 cells and levels of STAT3 in the lung tissues of WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), as well as more serious lung damage. In contrast, the concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and the chemokine keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) were significantly reduced during &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infection in IL-17A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and no effects were observed after AI-2 treatment (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the level of IL-17A in the lungs of WT mice was significantly reduced following infection with a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; strain harboring mutations in the QS genes &lt;em&gt;lasR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rhlR&lt;/em&gt; compared with the level of IL-17A following infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1. Our data suggest that AI-2 promotes &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway by interfering with the QS systems of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. IL-17A may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infections in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Erythropoietin mediates re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages through PI3K/AKT signaling and protects mice against secondary infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016936/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure leads to a hypo-responsive state by macrophages to a secondary stimulation of LPS, known as endotoxin tolerance. However, recent findings show that functions of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages are not completely suppressed, whereas they undergo a functional re-programming process with upregulation of a panel of molecules leading to enhanced protective functions including antimicrobial and tissue-remodeling activities. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), exerts anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective activities. Nevertheless, the potential effects of EPO on functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages have not been investigated yet. Here, we found that initial LPS exposure led to upregulation of HIF-1α/EPO in macrophages and that EPO enhanced tolerance in tolerized macrophages and mice as demonstrated by suppressed proinflammatory genes such as &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; after secondary LPS stimulation. Moreover, we showed that EPO improved host protective genes in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages and mice, such as the anti-bacterial genes coding for cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (&lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;) and macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (&lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;), and the tissue-repairing gene vascular endothelial growth factor C (&lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;). Therefore, our findings indicate that EPO mediates the functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages. Mechanistically, we found that PI3K/AKT signaling contributed to EPO-mediated re-programming through upregulation of &lt;em&gt;Irak3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wdr5&lt;/em&gt; expression. Specifically, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK3) was responsible for inhibiting proinflammatory genes &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; in tolerized macrophages after LPS rechallenge, whereas WDR5 contributed to the upregulation of host beneficial genes including &lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;. In a septic model of mice, EPO pretreatment significantly promoted endotoxin-tolerant re-programming, alleviated lung injury, enhanced bacterial clearance, and decreased mortality in LPS-tolerized mice after secondary infection of &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;. Collectively, our results reveal a novel role for EPO in mediating functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages; thus, targeting EPO appears to be a new therapeutic option in sepsis and other inflammatory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD-L1 maintains neutrophil extracellular traps release by inhibiting neutrophil autophagy in endotoxin-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016930/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is not only an important molecule in mediating tumor immune escape, but also regulates inflammation development. Here we showed that PD-L1 was upregulated on neutrophils in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Neutrophil specific knockout of PD-L1 reduced lung injury in ARDS model induced by intratracheal LPS injection. The level of NET release was reduced and autophagy is elevated by PD-L1 knockout in ARDS neutrophils both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Inhibition of autophagy could reverse the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 knockout on NET release. PD-L1 interacted with p85 subunit of PI3K at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in neutrophils from ARDS patients, activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. An extrinsic neutralizing antibody against PD-L1 showed a protective effect against ARDS. Together, PD-L1 maintains the release of NETs by regulating autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in ARDS. Anti-PD-L1 therapy may be a promising measure in treating ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Allyl methyl trisulfide protected against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice via inhibition of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allyl methyl trisulfide (AMTS) is one major lipid-soluble organosulfur compound of garlic. Previous studies have reported the potential therapeutic effect of garlic on acute lung injury (ALI) or its severe condition acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the specific substances that exert the regulatory effects are still unclear. In this study, we investigate the protective effects of AMTS on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice and explored the underlying mechanisms. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments, ICR mice were pretreated with 25-100 mg/kg AMTS for 7 days and followed by intratracheal instillation of LPS (1.5 mg/kg). The results showed that AMTS significantly attenuated LPS-induced deterioration of lung pathology, demonstrated by ameliorative edema and protein leakage, and improved pulmonary histopathological morphology. Meanwhile, the expression of inflammatory mediators and the infiltration of inflammation-regulation cells induced by LPS were also inhibited. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments also revealed that AMTS could alleviate inflammation response and inhibit the exaggeration of macrophage M1 polarization in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, we identified that AMTS treatment could attenuate the LPS-induced elevation of protein expression of p-IκBα, nuclear NF-κB-p65, COX2, iNOS, p-P38, p-ERK1/2, and p-JNK. Collectively, these data suggest that AMTS could attenuate LPS-induced ALI and the molecular mechanisms should be related to the suppression of the NF-κB and MAPKs pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Glycocalyx heparan sulfate cleavage promotes endothelial cell angiopoietin-2 expression by impairing shear stress-related AMPK/FoxO1 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35763350/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a key mediator of vascular disease during sepsis, and elevated plasma levels of Ang-2 are associated with organ injury scores and poor clinical outcomes. We have previously observed that biomarkers of endothelial glycocalyx (EG) damage correlate with plasma Ang-2 levels, suggesting a potential mechanistic linkage between EG injury and Ang-2 expression during states of systemic inflammation. However, the cell signaling mechanisms regulating Ang-2 expression following EG damage are unknown. In the current study, we determined the temporal associations between plasma heparan sulfate (HS) levels as a marker of EG erosion and plasma Ang-2 levels in children with sepsis and in mouse models of sepsis. Second, we evaluated the role of shear stress-mediated 5&amp;rsquo;-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in Ang-2 expression following enzymatic HS cleavage from the surface of human primary lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs). We found that plasma HS levels peaked before plasma Ang-2 levels in children and mice with sepsis. Further, we discovered that impaired AMPK signaling contributed to increased Ang-2 expression following HS cleavage from flow-conditioned HLMVECs, establishing a paradigm by which Ang-2 may be upregulated during sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA MNX1-AS1 sustains inactivation of Hippo pathway through a positive feedback loop with USP16/IGF2BP3 axis in gallbladder cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35953000/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MNX1-AS1 expression is upregulated in GBC and predicts poor prognosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overexpression of MNX1-AS1 facilitates the proliferation and metastasis of GBC cells in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MNX1-AS1 acts as a scaffold for recruiting USP16 to stabilize IGF2BP3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MNX1-AS1/IGF2BP3/Hippo pathway positive feedback loop contributes to GBC progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in multiple human cancers, which may offer great potential as putative targets for cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, the roles of most lncRNAs in gallbladder cancer (GBC) remain poorly understood. The objective of this research involves investigating the clinical implications and underlying mechanism of lncRNA motor neuron and pancreas homeobo×1 antisense RNA 1 (MNX1-AS1) in GBC. This study shows that MNX1-AS1 expression is elevated in the tissues of GBC patients, and is strongly associated with reduced patient survival. Functionally, MNX1-AS1 significantly stimulates the proliferation and metastasis of GBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MNX1-AS1 is transcriptionally activated by TEA domain family member 4 (TEAD4), and suppresses insulin-like growing factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) degradation by recruiting ubiquitin specific peptidase 16 (USP16). Furthermore, MNX1-AS1/IGF2BP3 axis inhibits the Hippo signaling pathway and subsequently activates TEAD4, thereby forming a positive feedback loop. According to our results, MNX1-AS1 facilitates tumorigenesis, progression and metastasis of GBC through a MNX1-AS1/IGF2BP3/Hippo pathway positive feedback loop, which could be both diagnostically and therapeutically helpful in GBC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USP25 Deficiency Exacerbates Acute Pancreatitis via Up-Regulating TBK1-NF-κB Signaling in Macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35934222/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Severe acute pancreatitis can easily lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome and death. Macrophages are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis (AP), and macrophage activation correlates with disease severity. In this study, we examined the role of ubiquitin-specific protease 25, a deubiquitinating enzyme and known regulator of macrophages, in the pathogenesis of AP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used L-arginine, cerulein, and choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet-induced models of AP in &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice and wild-type mice. We also generated bone marrow &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; chimeric mice and initiated L-arginine-mediated AP. Primary acinar cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from wild-type and &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice to dissect molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our results show that Usp25 deficiency exacerbates pancreatic and lung injury, neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, and systemic inflammatory responses in L-arginine, cerulein, and choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet-induced models of AP. Bone marrow &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; chimeric mice challenged with L-arginine show that &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in macrophages exaggerates AP by up-regulating the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Similarly, in vitro data confirm that Usp25 deficiency enhances the TBK1-NF-κB pathway, leading to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow-derived macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in macrophages enhances TBK1-NF-κB signaling, and the induction of inflammatory chemokines and type I interferon-related genes exacerbates pancreatic and lung injury in AP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Piceatannol-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway inhibition contributes to the alleviation of oxidative injury and collagen synthesis during pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35932616/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piceatannol lightened oxidative injury and collagen synthesis in lung tissues during pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piceatannol inhibited the activation and collagen synthesis of TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAK2 activation abolished the effects of piceatannol in TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is characterized by oxidative injury and excessive collagen synthesis in lung fibroblasts, causing impaired pulmonary function and chronic lung injury. Piceatannol, a dietary polyphenol, possesses vital pharmacological effects in metabolic disorders, cancers, cardiovascular disease and infectious disease; however, its role in PF is still not completely elucidated. Mice (8 to 10 weeks old) were administered bleomycin (BLM) intratracheally (2 U/kg) to establish an in vivo PF model. Murine primary lung fibroblasts were isolated and stimulated with TGF-β (10 ng/mL) for 48 h to induce its activation. Meanwhile, mice or primary lung fibroblasts were treated with different doses of piceatannol to observe its protective roles. Pulmonary function and arterial blood gas were detected to assess pulmonary physiological status. Collagen deposition and the mRNA levels of profibrotic genes were determined by H&amp;amp;E staining and RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the protein and mRNA markers, as well as end-product of oxidative stress were detected in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that pulmonary function was significantly impaired in BLM-induced mice, accompanied by elevated oxidative stress and excessive collagen synthesis. Piceatannol significantly improved pulmonary function and decreased oxidative injury as well as collagen synthesis in mice with PF. Mechanically, piceatannol treatment significantly inhibited the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in BLM-induced mice and TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts. Additional findings also demonstrated that coumermycin A1 (C-A1), an agonist of JAK2, could abolish the effects of piceatannol on TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts and reactivated the phosphorylation STAT3. Taken together, our study demonstrated that piceatannol could protect against oxidative injury and collagen synthesis during PF in a JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular histones induce inflammation and senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells by activating the AMPK/FOXO4 signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35913584/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is an abnormal immune-inflammatory response that is mainly caused by infection. It can lead to life-threatening organ dysfunction and death. Severely damaged tissue cells will release intracellular histones into the circulation as damage-related molecular patterns (DAMPs) to accelerate the systemic immune response. Although various histone-related cytotoxicity mechanisms have been explored, those that affect extracellular histones involved in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction are yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were stimulated with different concentrations of histones, and cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay. Cellular senescence was assessed by SA β-gal staining. C57BL/6 mice were treated with histones with or without BML-275 treatment. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 inflammasome proteins. The interaction of NLRP3 and ASC was detected by CoIP and immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we found that extracellular histones induced senescence and inflammatory response in a dose-dependent manner in cultured VSMCs. Histone treatment significantly promoted apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) as well as NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) interaction of inflammasomes in VSMCs. Forkhead box protein O4 (FOXO4), which is a downstream effector molecule of extracellular histones, was found to be involved in histone-regulated VSMC inflammatory response and senescence. Furthermore, the 5&amp;rsquo;-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway was confirmed to mediate extracellular histone-induced FOXO4 expression, and blocking this signaling pathway with an inhibitor can suppress vascular inflammation induced by extracellular histones &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Extracellular histones induce inflammation and senescence in VSMCs, and blocking the AMPK/FOXO4 pathway is a potential target for the treatment of histonemediated organ injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of PP2A /NLRP3 signaling pathway in ambient particulate matter 2.5 induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35926746/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambient particulate matter 2.5 (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) exposure has been linked to pulmonary fibrosis. However, the key signaling pathways remained unclear. In the present study, we applied a mouse model with myeloid-specific deletion of Ppp2r1a gene (encoding protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) A subunit) to identify the key signaling pathways involved in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced pulmonary fibrosis. PP2A Aα-/- homozygote mice and matched wild-type (WT) littermates were exposed to filtered air (FA), unfiltered air (UA), and concentrated PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; (CA) in a real-ambient PM exposure system for 8 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively. The mice exposed to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; displayed a progressive inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, the expressions of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, caspase-1, ASC and IL-1β were increased in mice lung following PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, indicating PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure caused pulmonary inflammation by the NLRP3 pathways activation. Furthermore, the effects of PM exposure on pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, oxidative stress, and pulmonary function damage were significantly enhanced in PP2A-/- mice compared to WT mice, indicating the role of PP2A in the regulation of pulmonary injury induced by PM exposure. In vitro study confirmed that PP2A was involved in the PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced inflammation response and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Importantly, we identified PP2A regulated the activation of NLRP3 pathways by direct dephosphorylating IRE1α in response to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PP2A-IRE1α-NLRP3 signaling pathway played a crucial role in regulating the inflammation response, triggering the lung fibrogenesis upon PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Our findings provide new insights into regulatory role of PP2A in human diseases upon the PM exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metabolic balance in colorectal cancer is maintained by optimal Wnt signaling levels</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wnt pathways are important for the modulation of tissue homeostasis, and their deregulation is linked to cancer development. Canonical Wnt signaling is hyperactivated in many human colorectal cancers due to genetic alterations of the negative Wnt regulator APC. However, the expression levels of Wnt-dependent targets vary between tumors, and the mechanisms of carcinogenesis concomitant with this Wnt signaling dosage have not been understood. In this study, we integrate whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screens with large-scale multi-omic data to delineate functional subtypes of cancer. We engineer APC loss-of-function mutations and thereby hyperactivate Wnt signaling in cells with low endogenous Wnt activity and find that the resulting engineered cells have an unfavorable metabolic equilibrium compared with cells which naturally acquired Wnt hyperactivation. We show that the dosage level of oncogenic Wnt hyperactivation impacts the metabolic equilibrium and the mitochondrial phenotype of a given cell type in a context-dependent manner. These findings illustrate the impact of context-dependent genetic interactions on cellular phenotypes of a central cancer driver mutation and expand our understanding of quantitative modulation of oncogenic signaling in tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PTPRO knockdown protects against inflammation in hemorrhage shock-induced lung injury involving the NF-κB signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35906634/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Hemorrhage shock (HS) is characterized by decreased tissue oxygenation and organ damage due to severe blood loss. Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) is abnormally up-regulated in the rat lungs after trauma/HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of PTPRO in lung inflammation following HS, we established a rat model of HS via withdrawing blood by a catheter inserted into the femoral artery followed by resuscitation. The rats were infected with lentivirus harboring short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting PTPRO by intratracheal instillation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; PTPRO was significantly up-regulated in rat lungs after HS. PTPRO knockdown enhanced epithelial integrity and reduced capillary leakage by up-regulating tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin (OCC) in the lungs. Besides, HS-induced myeloperoxidase activity and inflammatory cell infiltration was mitigated by PTPRO knockdown. The expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-2, MCP-1, and KC) in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was regressed after PTPRO knockdown. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway was involved in HS-induced lung inflammation. PTPRO down-regulation inhibited the NF-κB pathway activation by suppressing the phosphorylation of NF-κB and its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Taken together, we demonstrated that PTPRO knockdown may contribute to attenuating inflammation in HS-induced lung injury via inhibiting NF-κB pathway activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Glaesserella parasuis induces IL-17 production might through PKC-ERK/MAPK and IκB/NF-κB signaling pathways</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infections upregulated IL-17 production both in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virulent &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; strains could induced higher IL-17 production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-17 expression positively correlated with degree of pathological tissue injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infection induced IL-17 production through PKC-ERK/MAPK and IκB/NF-κB pathways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our previous study, the outer membrane protein P2 of &lt;em&gt;Glaesserella parasuis&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt;) induced the production of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in host cells. However, how the &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infection produces IL-17A in the host is unknown. In this study, at 48 hpi in piglets, the proportion of Th17 cells in the peripheral blood significantly increased as determined by flow cytometry, but the overall proportion was low. IL-17 mRNA and protein levels significantly increased in the lungs and spleens of infected piglets. Histopathological examination staining, immunohistochemistry and viability counts, revealed that IL-17 expression might be positively correlated with bacterial content and the degree of pathological injury in lung and spleen tissues. Furthermore, when infected with the &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; Nagasaki strain compared with avirulent strain C5, the primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) significantly produced IL-17 in a time-dose dependent manner. In addition, we demonstrated that PKC, MEK and NF-κB signaling pathways were essential for &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt;-induced IL-17 production because the addition of corresponding inhibitors dramatically reduced IL-17 mRNA production. The phosphorylation levels of PKC, ERK1/2 and IκB in &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt;-infected primary PAMs also increased significantly as the infection dose increased as assessed by western blotting. Thus, these finding imply that IL-17 induced by &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infection is dependent on activation of PKC-ERK/MAPK and IκB/NF-κB signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation promotes alveolar epithelial recovery by activating Hippo/YAP signaling after lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35973885/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The preferred configuration for bridging patients with respiratory failure while awaiting lung transplantation is venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO). However, the protective effect of VV ECMO on the lung, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the role of VV ECMO in preventing lung injury in vivo using a rat model. Additionally, the effects of Hippo/YAP signaling on alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2)-mediated alveolar epithelial recovery in VV ECMO rats were also investigated. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, RNA sequencing, lung injury, edema, and cytokine expression were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; VV ECMO significantly improved severe hypoxemia, reduced lung edema, and inflammatory response, and altered alveolar epithelial function, as indicated by reduced protein concentrations in BALF. This was associated with Hippo/YAP signaling activation, according to RNA sequencing analysis. Furthermore, we discovered that after VV ECMO, AT2 cells proliferated and differentiated, and this increase in AT2 cell activity was correlated to the increased nuclear expression of YAP, which is critical for alveolar epithelial recovery from lung injury. During VV ECMO, verteporfin-induced YAP inhibition and the loss of the oxygenator delayed lung alveolar epithelial recovery and led to a prolonged inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings suggest that VV ECMO protects against lung injury by activating the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. Strategies aimed at increasing YAP activity in AT2 cells could thus aid alveolar epithelial recovery, making VV ECMO easier for lung transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docetaxel resistance-derived LINC01085 contributes to the immunotherapy of hormone-independent prostate cancer by activating the STING/MAVS signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35868534/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;LINC01085&lt;/em&gt; is deleted in hormone-independent prostate cancer (HIPC) which can predict better outcomes of HIPC patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01085 acts as a tumor suppressor in the tumourigenicity and metastasis of HIPC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01085 exerts its functions by both interacting with TBK1 and GSK3β, accelerated TBK1 phosphorylation at the Ser-172 site, in HIPC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01085 combined with PARP inhibitor and anti-PD-L1 treatment may be pivotal in the treatment of HIPC patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquired docetaxel (doc) resistance, one of the major reasons for unfavorable prognosis in patients with aggressive hormone-independent prostate cancer (HIPC), is a major obstacle for patient treatment. Dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs promotes or suppresses chemoresistance in multiple cancers; however, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying HIPC remain unknown. In this study, we found that the LINC01085, as a tumor-suppressor, which showed significant clinically relevant in HIPC patients with doc-resistance. Mechanistically, in docetaxel-sensitive cells, LINC01085 could specifically bind to both TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and higher LINC01085 RNA levels could inhibit TBK1 dimerization. Whereas, in doc-resistant cells, lower LINC01085 RNA level lost the strong binding with both, meanwhile, the interaction between TBK1 and GSK3β enhanced which accelerated TBK1 phosphorylation at the Ser-172 site, resulting in decreased expression levels of PD-L1 and NF-κB as well as the secretion of type I/III interferons. Thus, Overexpression of LINC01085 combined with immune checkpoint blockade is an effective strategy for the treatment of HIPC patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A comprehensive network map of IL-17A signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35838944/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is one of the member of IL-17 family consisting of other five members (IL-17B to IL-17F). The Gamma delta (γδ) T cells and T helper 17 (Th17) cells are the major producers of IL-17A. Aberrant signaling by IL-17A has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury, chronic airway diseases, and cancer. Activation of the IL-17A/IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) system regulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT serine/threonine kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) mediated signaling pathways. The IL-17RA activation orchestrates multiple downstream signaling cascades resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, chemokines (C-X-C motif) and promotes neutrophil-mediated immune response. Considering the biomedical importance of IL-17A, we developed a pathway resource of signaling events mediated by IL-17A/IL-17RA in this study. The curation of literature data pertaining to the IL-17A system was performed manually by the NetPath criteria. Using data mined from the published literature, we describe an integrated pathway reaction map of IL-17A/IL-17RA consisting of 114 proteins and 68 reactions. That includes detailed information on IL-17A/IL-17RA mediated signaling events of 9 activation/inhibition events, 17 catalysis events, 3 molecular association events, 68 gene regulation events, 109 protein expression events, and 6 protein translocation events. The IL-17A signaling pathway map data is made freely accessible through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5242&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WikiPathways Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the JAK/STAT Pathway with Baricitinib Reduces the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Caused by Hemorrhagic Shock in Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35837955/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; The aim of this study was to investigate (a) the effects of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway inhibitor (baricitinib) on the MODS in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock (HS) and (b) whether treatment with baricitinib attenuates the activation of JAK/STAT, NF-κB and NLRP3 caused by HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Post-traumatic MODS, which is in part due to excessive systemic inflammation, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The JAK/STAT pathway is a regulator of numerous growth factor and cytokine receptors and, hence, is considered a potential master regulator of many inflammatory signaling processes. However, its role in trauma-hemorrhage is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; An acute HS rat model was performed to determine the effect of baricitinib on MODS. The activation of JAK/STAT, NF-κB and NLRP3 pathways were analyzed by western blotting in the kidney and liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrate here for the first time that treatment with baricitinib (during resuscitation following severe hemorrhage) attenuates the organ injury and dysfunction and the activation of JAK/STAT, NF-κB and NLRP3 pathways caused by HS in the rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results point to a role of the JAK/STAT pathway in the pathophysiology of the organ injury and dysfunction caused by trauma/hemorrhage and indicate that JAK inhibitors, such as baricitinib, may be repurposed for the treatment of the MODS after trauma and/or hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the male urinary system. In recent years, the morbidity and mortality of PCa have been increasing due to the limited effects of existing treatment strategies. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00893 was reported to inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of papillary thyroid cancer cells, but its role in PCa has not been reported. This study aims to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of LINC00893 in regulating the progression of PCa cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We first compared LINC00893 expression levels between PCa tissues and normal prostate tissues through TCGA database. The relative LINC00893 expression levels were further validated in 66 pairs of PCa tissues and para-cancerous normal tissues, as well as in PCa cell lines. Gain-of-function experiment was performed by transfecting PCa cell with LINC00893 expression vector, and CCK (Cell count kit)-8, 5-Ethynyl-2&amp;rsquo;-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, colony information and transwell assays were conducted to assess the functional phenotypes. Dual-luciferase reporter, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pull-down assays were performed to evaluate the molecular interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; LINC00893 was downregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines, and patients with low expression of LINC00893 were associated with a poorer overall survival rate. LINC00893 overexpression hindered the proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as the migratory ability of PCa cells, and suppressed the tumorigenesis of PCa cells in nude mice. We further demonstrated that LINC00893 acted as a sponge for miR-3173-5p and inhibited its activity, which in turn regulated the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)/Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study demonstrated that LINC00893 suppresses the progression of PCa cells through targeting miR-3173-5p/SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 axis. Our data uncovers a novel tumor-suppressor role of LINC00893 in PCa, which may serve as a potential strategy for targeted therapy in PCa.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>p53/sirtuin 1/NF-κB Signaling Axis in Chronic Inflammation and Maladaptive Kidney Repair After Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35874713/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation contributes to maladaptive kidney repair, but its regulation is unclear. Here, we report that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is downregulated after repeated low-dose cisplatin (RLDC) injury, and this downregulation leads to p65 acetylation and consequent NF-κB activation resulting in a persistent inflammatory response. RLDC induced the down-regulation of SIRT1 and activation of NF-κB, which were accompanied by chronic tubular damage, tubulointerstitial inflammation, and fibrosis in mice. Inhibition of NF-κB suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic phenotypes in RLDC-treated renal tubular cells. SIRT1 activation by its agonists markedly reduced the acetylation of p65 (a key component of NF-κB), resulting in the attenuation of the inflammatory and fibrotic responses. Conversely, knockdown of SIRT1 exacerbated these cellular changes. At the upstream, p53 was activated after RLDC treatment to repress SIRT1, resulting in p65 acetylation, NF-κB activation and transcription of inflammatory cytokines. In mice, SIRT1 agonists attenuated RLDC-induced chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and renal fibrosis. Together, these results unveil the p53/SIRT1/NF-κB signaling axis in maladaptive kidney repair following RLDC treatment, where p53 represses SIRT1 to increase p65 acetylation for NF-κB activation, leading to chronic renal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 Pathway Protects against Ferroptosis in Radiation-Induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35847598/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is one of the most common, serious, and dose-limiting toxicities of thoracic radiotherapy. A primary cause for this is the radiation-induced cell death. Ferroptosis is a recently recognized form of regulated cell death, characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS generated by irradiation might be the original trigger of ferroptosis in RILI. In addition, activation of the P62-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway has been shown to blunt ferroptosis and thus acts as a protective factor. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the protective effect of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway against radiation-induced ferroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells. First, we found that radiation induced ferroptosis in vitro using a RILI cell model, which could be significantly reduced by ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a specific ferroptosis inhibitor. Additionally, overexpression of P62 interacted with Keap1 to facilitate the translocation of NRF2 into the nucleus and promote the expression of its target proteins, including quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1). In summary, our results demonstrated that the activation of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway prevents radiation-induced ferroptosis in RILI cells, providing a theoretical basis of finding a potential therapeutic approach for RILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatiotemporal regulation of insulin signaling by liquid-liquid phase separation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insulin signals through its receptor to recruit insulin receptor substrates (IRS) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to the plasma membrane for production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], which consequently activates protein kinase B (PKB). How insulin signals transduce from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm is not clearly understood. Here we show that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) plays a critical role in spatiotemporal control of insulin signaling through regulating multiple components including IRS1. Both protein concentration and insulin stimulation can drive the formation of intracellular IRS1 condensates through LLPS. Components including PI(4,5)P2, p85-PI3K and PDK1 are constitutively present in IRS1 condensates whereas production of PIP3 and recruitment of PKB in them are induced by insulin. Thus, IRS1 condensates function as intracellular signal hubs to mediate insulin signaling, whose formation is impaired in insulin resistant cells. Collectively, these data reveal an important function of LLPS in spatiotemporal control of insulin signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting p65 to inhibit Cas3 transcription by Onjisaponin B for radiation damage therapy in p65&#43;/- mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35816993/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35816993/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In response to radiation injury, p65 becomes activated. The formation of p65 is one target of Onjisaponin B (OB), but it has not been studied in radioprotection. In addition, there is a binding site for p65 in the promoter region of Cas3. This study evaluates the use of OB as an intervention to modulate p65/Cas3 following radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to confirm that OB regulated the transcription of Cas3 via p65 to overcome radiation-induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Cells and mice were exposed to X-rays at a dose of 6 Gy. Immunofluorescence was used to locate intracellular p65. For the protein and mRNA analyses, Western blotting and RT-qPCR-based assays were conducted accordingly. HE staining was used to observe pathological changes in tissues. DNA damage was detected by the comet assay and DNA ladder assay. Next, apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and Hoechst staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with the radiation group, the expression levels of p-p65 and c-Cas3 in the drug group were significantly down-regulated by OB 20 µg/ml. When the expression of p65 was suppressed in V79 and TC cells, OB did not significantly inhibit the activation of p65 or Cas3 in response to irradiation, nor did it significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of p65 and subsequent nuclear translocation. Overexpression of p65 in V79 and MTEC-1 cells resulted in OB significantly inhibiting the activation of p65 and Cas3, and the phosphorylation and translocation of p65 into the nucleus. At 3 d for V79 cells and 24 h for MTEC-1 cells after radiation, compared with the Cas3 over plasmid transfection group, the drug transfection group had no significant effect on reducing apoptosis. In p65+/- mice, expression of the p65 gene was knocked down, leading to increased tissue apoptosis and inflammation, and serious tissue pathological changes. The inhibition of p65 activation by OB after radiation exposure was not apparent in the thymus, although it was observed in the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; OB interfered with radiation injury by targeting and regulating p65/Cas3. Therefore, it has been concluded that p65 is an important target molecule for the treatment of radiation injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insights on the cGAS-STING Signaling Pathway During Herpesvirus Infections</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35844623/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herpesviruses belong to large double-stranded DNA viruses. They are under a wide range of hosts and establish lifelong infection, which creates a burden on human health and animal health. Innate immunity is the host&amp;rsquo;s innate defense ability. Activating the innate immune signaling pathway and producing type I interferon is the host&amp;rsquo;s first line of defense against infectious pathogens. Emerging evidence indicates that the cGAS-STING signaling pathway plays an important role in the innate immunity in response to herpesvirus infections. In parallel, because of the constant selective pressure imposed by host immunity, herpesvirus also evolves to target the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to inhibit or escape the innate immune responses. In the current review, we insight on the classical cGAS-STING signaling pathway. We describe the activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway during herpesvirus infections and strategies of herpesvirus targeting this pathway to evade host antiviral response. Furthermore, we outline the immunotherapy boosting cGAS-STING signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prediction of the Mechanism of Sodium Butyrate against Radiation-Induced Lung Injury in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Dynamic Simulations and Molecular Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35837112/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a severe side effect of radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ,and one of the major hindrances to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. Previous studies have confirmed that sodium butyrate (NaB) has potential of anti-radiation toxicity. However, the mechanism of the protective effect of NaB against RILI has not yet been clarified. This study aimed to explore the underlying protective mechanisms of NaB against RILI in NSCLC through network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The predictive target genes of NaB were obtained from the PharmMapper database and the literature review. The involved genes of RILI and NSCLC were predicted using OMIM and GeneCards database. The intersectional genes of drug and disease were identified using the Venny tool and uploaded to the Cytoscape software to identify 5 core target genes of NaB associated with RILI. The correlations between the 5 core target genes and EGFR, PD-L1, immune infiltrates, chemokines and chemokine receptors were analyzed using TIMER 2.0, TIMER and TISIDB databases. We constructed the mechanism maps of the 3 key signaling pathways using the KEGG database based on the results of GO and KEGG analyses from Metascape database. The 5 core target genes and drug were docked using the AutoDock Vina tool and visualized using PyMOL software. GROMACS software was used to perform 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation. Irradiation-induced lung injury model in mice were established to assess the therapeutic effects of NaB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 51 intersectional genes involved in NaB against RILI in NSCLC were identified. The 5 core target genes were AKT1, TP53, NOTCH1, SIRT1, and PTEN. The expressions of the 5 core target genes were significantly associated with EGFR, PD-L1, immune infiltrates, chemokines and chemokine receptors, respectively. The results from GO analysis of the 51 intersectional genes revealed that the biological processes were focused on the regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, oxidative stress and cell death, while the three key KEGG pathways were enriched in PI3K-Akt signal pathway, p53 signal pathway, and FOXO signal pathway. The docking of NaB with the 5 core target genes showed affinity and stability, especially AKT1. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments showed that NaB treatment significantly protected mice from RILI, with reduced lung histological damage. In addition, NaB treatment significantly inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; NaB may protect patients from RILI in NSCLC through multiple target genes including AKT1, TP53, NOTCH1, SIRT1 and PTEN, with multiple signaling pathways involving, including PI3K-Akt pathway, p53 pathway, and FOXO pathways. Our findings effectively provide a feasible theoretical basis to further elucidate the mechanism of NaB in the treatment of RILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The protective effects of Mai-Luo-Ning injection against LPS-induced acute lung injury via the TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35793597/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35793597/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe inflammatory disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Various therapeutic strategies for ALI have been proposed over the last few decades; however, the treatment options remain limited. Mai-Luo-Ning injection (MLN), a traditional Chinese medical formulation, has been extensively used for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Nevertheless, the effects of MLN on ALI remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to investigate the protective and therapeutic effects of MLN on lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI mouse models and RAW 264.7 cells, and further explore the underlying mechanism of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The therapeutic activity of MLN was evaluated using an &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; ALI model and an in vitro model of RAW 264.7 macrophages. UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS was used to investigate the chemical constituents of the MLN. The material basis and potential protective mechanism of MLN were analyzed using network pharmacology. The roles of MLN in inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/ nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signalling pathway were investigated via western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments demonstrated that MLN ameliorated LPS-induced histological changes in lung tissues and reduced lung wet/dry weight ratio, total protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and myeloperoxidase activity. Furthermore, MLN downregulated the &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and in vitro expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that MLN could act synergistically through multiple targets and pathways and exert a protective effect, possibly through inhibiting TLR4/ NF-κB signalling pathways. Western blotting and immunofluorescence experiments further confirmed that MLN could regulate the expression of TLR4, MyD88, phospho-IκB-α, and phospho-NF-κB p65 in the TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway and decrease the translocation of phospho-NF-κB p65 into the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study suggests that MLN has a potential protective effect against LPS-induced ALI, which might be associated with the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway. Therefore, MLN is worthy of further investigation as a potential candidate for the treatment of ALI in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Garcinone C Suppresses Tumorsphere Formation and Invasiveness by Hedgehog/Gli1 Signaling in Colorectal Cancer Stem-like Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35749593/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperactivation of hedgehog signaling occurs in colorectal cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), a rare subpopulation, potentially involved in metastasis, chemotherapy resistance, and cancer relapse. Garcinone C, a xanthone isolated from mangosteen (&lt;em&gt;Garcinia mangostana&lt;/em&gt;), suppresses colorectal cancer &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; by inhibiting Gli1-dependent noncanonical hedgehog signaling. Herein, we investigated the effect of garcinone C on cancer stemness and invasiveness in colorectal cancer; Gli1 was noted as pivotal in maintaining stemness and invasiveness in HCT116 and HT29 CSCs. Garcinone C inhibited the proliferation and self-renewal of HCT116 and HT29 CSCs. Colon cancer stemness markers such as CD44, CD133, ALDH1, and Nanog were significantly decreased by garcinone C. Computational studies showed that garcinone C showed a high affinity with the Gli1 protein ZF domain by forming hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues of ASP244, ARG223, and ASP216. Besides, MG132 blocked the effects of garcinone C on Gli1. Thus, garcinone C suppressed colorectal CSCs by binding to Gli1 and enhancing its degradation. MMP2 and MMP9 levels, invasive-related markers, were increased in HCT116 CSCs but decreased by garcinone C. E-cadherin level was reduced in HCT116 CSCs, while the presence of garcinone C was restored. Garcinone C inhibited the proliferation and invasiveness of colorectal CSCs by targeting Gli1-dependent Hh signaling. Garcinone C may be a potent natural agent against colorectal cancer relapse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01194 was highly expressed in TNBC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01194 recruited NUMA1 to stabilize UBE2C mRNA, thereby promoting RYR2 ubiquitination and degradation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01194/NUMA1/UBE2C/RYR2/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway might provide an effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 1194 (LINC01194) has been reported as an oncogene in several cancer types, but its expression and potential role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are still unclear. We found that LINC01194 was significantly highly expressed in TNBC based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Data from in vitro experiments and in vivo assays demonstrated that LINC01194 promoted TNBC progression. Through bioinformatics prediction, mass spectrometry, and mechanical experiments, we found that LINC01194 could recruit nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1 (NUMA1) to bind to the untranslated region (3&amp;rsquo;UTR) of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 C (UBE2C) 3&amp;rsquo; and stabilize UBE2C mRNA. Moreover, we found that UBE2C acted as an ubiquitin ligase to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of ryanodine receptor type 2 (RYR2) that inhibited the progression of TNBC by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In summary, LINC01194 activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and accelerates the malignant progression of TNBC by recruiting NUMA1 to stabilize UBE2C mRNA and thus promotes RYR2 ubiquitination and degradation. These findings might provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 conferred potent protection against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 inhibited M1 macrophage polarization, limiting its pro-inflammatory activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 suppressed NF-κB and STAT1 signaling by targeting IKKβ as well as STAT1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACT001 has been shown to exhibit excellent antitumor and anti-fibrosis activities. However, the role of ACT001 in acute lung injury (ALI) and the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of ACT001 on ALI and explore the potential mechanisms. Herein, we firstly established the ALI mouse model induced by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ACT001 treatment significantly alleviated histopathological changes of lung tissues with lower infiltration of pulmonary M1 macrophages in ALI mice. Then, we performed in vitro experiment and found that ACT001 treatment effectively inhibited the M1 phenotype of RAW264.7 and THP-1.. Next, we performed pull-down and mass spectrometry analysis to screen the interacting proteins of ACT001, identifying IKKβ and STAT1 as the critical target proteins of ACT001. And ACT001 treatment significantly suppressed the NF-κB and STAT1 pathways, thereby inhibiting the M1 polarization against inflammation in vivo and in vitro. Finally, we used IMD 0354 (IMD) and Fludarabine (Flud) to specifically block the activity of IKKβ and STAT1, and stimulated macrophages through IKKβ and STAT1 overexpression. Our data clearly showed that ACT001-induced decrease of the M1 polarization was blocked by IMD and Flud treatment, and reversed by IKKβ and STAT1 overexpression in RAW264.7 cells. In conclusion, we discovered that ACT001 significantly alleviates inflammation and limits M1 phenotype of pulmonary macrophages via suppressing NF-κB and STAT1 signaling pathways, providing new insights for the development of drugs to treat ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High phosphate-induced progressive proximal tubular injury is associated with the activation of Stat3/Kim-1 signaling pathway and macrophage recruitment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35713543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary phosphate intake in the Western population greatly exceeds the recommended dietary allowance and is linked to enhanced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It is unclear whether a chronic high phosphate diet (HPD) causes kidney injury in healthy individuals. Here, we show that feeding a 2% HPD in C57BL/6N mice for one up to six months resulted in hyperphosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia, increased plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) compared to mice on a 0.8% phosphate diet. Kidney injury was already noted after two months of HPD characterized by loss of proximal tubular (PT) cell polarity, flattened epithelia, disruption of brush border membranes, vacuolization, increased PT cell proliferation, marked interstitial mononuclear infiltration, and progressive accumulation of collagen fibers. HPD increased Stat3 activation and Kim-1 expression in PT epithelial cells and enhanced renal synthesis of chemokines recruiting monocytes and macrophages as well as macrophage related factors. Enhanced recruitment of F4/80+ macrophages around injured PT lesions was timely associated with increased Kim-1 synthesis, tubular MCP-1 expression, and degree of PT injury score. Likewise, tubulointerstitial fibrosis was associated with activation of Stat3/Kim-1 signaling pathway. The stimulation of human proximal tubular cells with high phosphate activated Stat3 signaling and induced HAVCR1 and CCL2 expression. We conclude that high phosphate results in progressive proximal tubular injury, indicating that high dietary phosphate intake may affect kidney health and therefore represents an underestimated health problem for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long non-coding RNA SNHG5 mediates periodontal inflammation through the NF-κB signalling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35713268/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the role of long non-coding RNAs and small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; A ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model was established, and gingival tissues were collected from patients with periodontitis and healthy controls. Inflammatory cytokines were detected using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analyses. Direct interactions between SNHG5 and p65 were detected by RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Micro-computed tomography, haematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemical staining were used to measure periodontal bone loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; SNHG5 expression was down-regulated in human and mouse periodontal tissues compared to that in the healthy controls. In vitro experiments demonstrated that SNHG5 significantly ameliorated tumour necrosis factor α-induced inflammation. Mechanistically, SNHG5 directly binds to the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 subunit and inhibits its translocation, thereby suppressing the NF-κB signalling pathway activation and reducing the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing three inflammasome expression. Locally injecting si-SNHG5 aggravated the periodontal destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study revealed that SNHG5 mediates periodontal inflammation through the NF-κB signalling pathway, providing a potential therapeutic target for periodontitis treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut dysbiosis promotes prostate cancer progression and docetaxel resistance via activating NF-κB-IL6-STAT3 axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35710492/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The gut microbiota is reportedly involved in the progression and chemoresistance of various human malignancies. However, the underlying mechanisms behind how it exerts some effect on prostate cancer, as an extra-intestinal tumor, in a contact-independent way remain elusive and deserve exploration. Antibiotic exposure, one of the various factors affecting the gut microbiota community and capable of causing gut dysbiosis, is associated with multiple disorders. This study aims to preliminarily clarify the link between gut dysbiosis and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; First, we discovered that perturbing the gut microbiota by consuming broad-spectrum antibiotics in water promoted the growth of subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors in mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation could transmit the effect of antibiotic exposure on tumor growth. Then, 16S rRNA sequencing for mouse feces indicated that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher after antibiotic exposure. Meanwhile, intratumoral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profoundly increased under the elevation of gut permeability. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that the NF-κB-IL6-STAT3 axis activated by intratumoral LPS facilitated prostate cancer proliferation and docetaxel chemoresistance. Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing of patients&amp;rsquo; fecal samples revealed that Proteobacteria was enriched in patients with metastatic prostate cancer and was positively correlated with plasma IL6 level, regional lymph node metastasis status, and distant metastasis status. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria had better performance than the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in predicting the probability of distant metastasis in prostate cancer (area under the ROC curve, 0.860; p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, this research demonstrated that gut dysbiosis, characterized by the enrichment of Proteobacteria due to antibiotic exposure, resulted in the elevation of gut permeability and intratumoral LPS, promoting the development of prostate cancer via the NF-κB-IL6-STAT3 axis in mice. Considering findings from human patients, Proteobacteria might act as an intestinal biomarker for progressive prostate cancer. Video Abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brevilin A Ameliorates Acute Lung Injury and Inflammation Through Inhibition of NF-κB Signaling via Targeting IKKα/β</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35774606/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is life-threatening disease characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory response. IKKα/β, the key kinases in the activation of NF-κB pathway, are implicated in inflammatory pulmonary injury, and represent attractive targets for ALI therapy. Brevilin A (BVA) is a sesquiterpene lactone from Centipeda minima, a Chinese herb used to treat inflammatory diseases. This study aims to investigate the inhibition of BVA on ALI, with focus on clarifying the molecular mechanisms involved in BVA-mediated anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages. Briefly, BVA significantly inhibited the production of NO and PGE2 by suppressing iNOS and COX2 expression, and suppressed the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα in LPS/IFNγ-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. The anti-inflammatory activity of BVA was further confirmed in LPS/IFNγ-stimulated BMDMs and TNFα/IFNγ-exposed RAW264.7 cells. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, BVA effectively attenuated LPS-induced lung damage, inflammatory infiltration, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including MPO, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and PGE2. Mechanistically, BVA could covalently bind to the cysteine 114 of IKKα/β, and effectively inhibiting the activity and function of IKKα/β, thereby resulting in the suppression of phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and the subsequent activation of NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, pretreatment of DTT, a thiol ligand donor, significantly abolished BVA-mediated effects in LPS/IFNγ-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, suggesting the crucial role of the electrophilic α, β-unsaturated ketone of BVA on its anti-inflammatory activity. These results suggest that BVA ameliorates ALI through inhibition of NF-κB signaling via covalently targeting IKKα/β, raising the possibility that BVA could be effective in the treatment of ALI and other diseases harboring aberrant NF-κB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RP105 protects against ischemic and septic acute kidney injury via suppressing TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35696803/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35696803/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RP105 is a member of the TLR family and its expression plays a role in cardiovascular disease but the therapeutic impact on acute kidney injury remained unclear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have uncovered evidence that RP105 expression in proximal tubular cells plays a kidney protective role during ischemic and septic acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RP105 reduces tubular cell death, NF-κB activation and inflammatory response during AKI with a mechanism involving interaction with TLR4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This finding may have clinical translation as kidney protection and inflammation regulation could be achieved through RP105 gene therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical and severe clinical disease caused by a variety of factors. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in pathogenesis of AKI. Radioprotective 105 kDa protein (RP105) is a member of the TLR family, but the role of RP105 in AKI is unknown. In this study, we overexpressed RP105 in renal tissue and cultured proximal tubular cells in which we then induced ischemic and septic AKI. Renal structure injuries were examined by hematoxylin eosin staining, while renal function was assessed by measuring serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (SCr) levels. The TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis induced changes in the expression of RP105, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in renal tissue detected by Western blot. Inflammatory cytokines including iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The inflammatory indicators, F4/80 and MPO, were identified by IHC staining. The results showed that expression of the TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway was enhanced in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and septic renal injury, and that overexpression of RP105 in renal tissue alleviated ischemic and septic AKI. Moreover, RP105 gene delivery was associated with reduced renal inflammatory cells infiltration and inflammatory cytokines after AKI. RP105 overexpression also inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-κB after AKI in both in vitro and in vivo, and blunted the interaction between Myeloid Differentiation factor 2 (MD2) and TLR4. These results indicated that RP105 protected against renal ischemic and septic AKI injury by suppressing inflammatory responses mediated by TLR4 signaling pathways. This study suggests that the anti-inflammatory roles of RP105 have potential for preventing and treating renal ischemic and septic AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CREB1 contributes colorectal cancer cell plasticity by regulating lncRNA CCAT1 and NF-κB pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35696016/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CREB1 gene encodes an exceptionally pleiotropic transcription factor that frequently dysregulated in human cancers. CREB1 can regulate tumor cell status of proliferation and/or migration; however, the molecular basis for this switch involvement in cell plasticity has not fully been understood yet. Here, we first show that knocking out CREB1 triggers a remarkable effect of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and leads to the occurrence of inhibited proliferation and enhanced motility in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. By monitoring 45 cellular signaling pathway activities, we find that multiple growth-related pathways decline significantly while inflammatory pathways including NF-κB are largely upregulated in comparing between the CREB1 wild-type and knocked out cells. Mechanistically, cells with CREB1 knocked out show downregulation of MYC as a result of impaired CREB1-dependent transcription of the oncogenic lncRNA CCAT1. Interestingly, the unbalanced competition between the coactivator CBP/p300 for CREB1 and p65 leads to the activation of the NF-κB pathway in cells with CREB1 disrupted, which induces an obvious EMT phenotype of the cancer cells. Taken together, these studies identify previously unknown mechanisms of CREB1 in CRC cell plasticity via regulating lncRNA CCAT1 and NF-κB pathways, providing a critical insight into a combined strategy for CREB1-targeted tumor therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New mechanism of nephrotoxicity of triptolide: Oxidative stress promotes cGAS-STING signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35697291/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triptolide activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in kidney tubular cells in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STING inhibitor C176 had protective effects in TPL-induced nephrocyte damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triptolide induced an enhancement in protein levels of BACH1, while the expression of HMOX1 was reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oxidative stress-induced mtDNA damage and DNA leakage were the causes of the activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triptolide (TPL) is a bioactive component extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F., and has multiple pharmacological activities, such as anti-tumor activity. However, severe adverse effects and toxicity, especially nephrotoxicity, limit its clinical application. It has been demonstrated that mitochondrial defect is a major toxic effects of TPL. In this study, we show that triptolide activated the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in kidney tubular cells in vivo and in vitro. Renal injury models were established in BALB/c mice and human tubular epithelial cells using TPL. We found that TPL enhanced the phosphorylation levels of STING, TBK1 and IRF3, and upregulated the expression of IFNβ, which is the production of cGAS-STING signaling pathway. STING inhibitor C176 had protective effects in TPL-induced nephrocyte damage. STING siRNA down regulated the expression level of IFNβ. In addition, triptolide induced an increase in protein levels of the transcription factor BACH1, while transcriptional expression of the antioxidant enzyme HMOX1 was reduced due to the increased expression of BACH1. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced mtDNA damage and DNA leakage caused activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Altogether, cGAS-STING signaling pathway involved in TPL induced nephrotoxicity. Inhibiting cGAS-STING over-activation may be a new strategy for alleviating renal injury of triptolide.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigallocatechin Gallate Relieved PM2.5-Induced Lung Fibrosis by Inhibiting Oxidative Damage and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition through AKT/mTOR Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35707275/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative damage and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are main pathological processes leading to the development of PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis. Epigallocatechin gallate (EG), a natural polyphenol extracted from green tea, possesses the ability to combat oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the potential roles of EG in PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis have not been reported yet. In the present study, we investigated whether EG could relieve PM2.5-induced lung injury and fibrosis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. To mimic PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis, C57/BL6 mice were intranasally instilled with PM2.5 suspension, and MLE-12 lung epithelial cells were stimulated with PM2.5 (100 μg/mL) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. The results showed that intragastric administration of EG (20 mg/kg/d or 80 mg/kg/d for 8 weeks) significantly prevented lung injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress in PM2.5-induced mice, apart from inhibiting collagen deposition. Additionally, EG treatment also suppressed the activation of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in lung tissues challenged with PM2.5. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments further demonstrated that EG treatment could enhance cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner in PM2.5-treated MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. Also, the overexpression of constitutively active AKT could offset the inhibitory effects of EG on EMT and oxidative stress in PM2.5-treated MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. Finally, AKT overexpression also blocked the inhibitory effect of EG on the phosphorylation of mTOR in PM2.5-treated MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. In conclusion, EG could improve PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis by decreasing oxidative damage and EMT through AKT/mTOR pathway, which might be a potential candidate for the treatment of PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ginkgolide C Alleviates Acute Lung Injury Caused by Paraquat Poisoning via Regulating the Nrf2 and NF- κ B Signaling Pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35707280/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paraquat (PQ), a highly toxic herbicide and primary attack for lung, results in severe acute lung injury (ALI) appeared as evident oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Increasing evidence elucidates that nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) exhibit many merits for protection of ALI by coordinating a fine-turned response to oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Ginkgolide C (GC) has been reported to be a safe and potent therapeutic agent against ALI. However, whether GC could protect ALI induced by PQ poisoning and the possible underlining mechanisms have remained not to be fully elucidated. A rat model of ALI and a model of acute type II alveolar epithelial cell (RLE-6TN) injury constructed by exposure to PQ were applied to discuss the protective effect of GC. Furthermore, Nrf2 gene silencing RLE-6TN cells were used to discuss the exact mechanism. We confirmed that GC significantly ameliorated the histopathological damages, ultrastructural changes, lung injury score, W/D ratio, and Hyp activity of lung tissue and inhibited polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration after PQ poisoning. Further results revealed that GC remarkably activated Nrf2-based cytoprotective system and inhibited NF-κB-induced inflammatory injury as well as apoptosis. Taken together, we concluded that GC preserved protection of PQ-induced ALI via the Nrf2-NF-κB dependent signal pathway, which may provide us novel insights into the treatment strategies for PQ poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;TLR-4/NF-kB/iNOS pathway may be involved in the renoprotective effect of Ang1–7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a critical condition with a high mortality rate, but effective management is still deficient. Till date, there are no studies that have addressed the effect of angiotensin 1-7 in this condition, hence, the rationale of this study was to evaluate the potential protective effect of Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7), on rhabdomyolysis (RM) induced kidney injury in rats and detecting the underlying mechanistic insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; Forty adult male albino rats were divided into groups; the control group, RM group, RM+Ang1-7 group, and RM+Ang1-7+ A779 group. Sera and urine samples were collected for analysis of renal and muscle injury markers. Kidney tissues were taken for estimation of oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers as well as angiotensin-II (Ang II) and Ang1-7. Renal histology and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase-1 (iNOS), real-time PCR for angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), nuclear erythroid factor-2 (Nrf-2), Toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and NF-kB in kidney tissues were also measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; Induction of RM caused renal oxidative stress injury, inflammation, apoptosis and marked deterioration in kidney functions as well as reduction of Ang1-7 and raised Angiotensin-II level in kidney tissues. Administration of Ang1-7 to the RM group reversed all the affected parameters which were blocked by A779 administration (Mas receptor blocker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; We concluded that Ang1-7 could be a potential therapeutic agent that could mitigate RM-induced renal injury. The underlying mechanisms may involve Stimulation of the ACE-2/Ang1-7/MasR axis and modulation of TLR-4/NF-kB/iNOS and Nrf-2/heme‑oxygenase -1 pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stat3/IL-6 signaling mediates sustained pneumonia induced by Agiostrongylus cantonensis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35617354/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angiostrongylus cantonensis (AC) is well-documented that parasitizes the host brain and causes eosinophilic meningitis. The migration route of AC in permissive hosts is well demonstrated, while in nonpermissive hosts, it remains to be fully defined. In the present study, we exploited live imaging technology, morphological and pathological configuration analysis, and molecular biological technologies to explore the migration route of AC and the accompanying tissue damage in nonpermissive and permissive hosts. Our data indicated that, in nonpermissive host mouse, AC larvae migrated from intestinal wall to liver at 2 hours post-infection (hpi), from liver to lung at 4 hpi and then from lung to brain at 8 hpi. AC larval migration caused fatal lung injury (pneumonia) during acute and early infection phases, along with significant activation of Stat3/IL-6 signaling. In addition, AC induce sustained interstitial pneumonia in mouse and rat and pulmonary fibrosis only in rat during late infection phase. Moreover, during the early and late infection phases, Th2 cytokine expression and Stat3 and IL-6 signaling were persistently enhanced and myeloid macrophage cells were notably enriched in host lung, and administration of Stat3 and IL-6 inhibitors (C188-9 and LMT-28) attenuated AC infection-induced acute pneumonia in mice. Overall, we are the first to provide direct and systemic laboratory evidence of AC migration route in a nonpermissive host and report that infection with a high dose of AC larvae could result in acute and fatal pneumonia through Stat3/IL-6 signaling in mice. These findings may present a feasible to rational strategy to minimize the pathogenesis induced by AC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of the AMPK-ULK1 pathway mediated protective autophagy by sevoflurane anesthesia restrains LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35605434/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevoflurane alleviates LPS-induced ALI by activating cell protective autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevoflurane triggers protective autophagy by activating AMPK/ULK1/PIKFYVE pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevoflurane restrains LPS-induced ALI via AMPK/ULK1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Sevoflurane anesthesia is deemed as potential therapeutic drug for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI), but the molecular mechanisms have not been fully delineated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim:&lt;/em&gt; The present study explored the specific molecular mechanism of sevoflurane regulating autophagy to reduce LPS induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male C57BL/6J mice and mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (MPVECs) were treated with LPS to construct ALI models, and the levels of inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy were detected after treatment with sevoflurane. Meanwhile, cells were treated with autophagy inhibitor or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) pathway inhibitor in vitro to detect their effects on cell survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Sevoflurane reduced inflammation, recovered cell division so as to suppress cell apoptosis and maintain cell survival, and activated autophagic flux in LPS-induced ALI models in vivo and in vitro. Of note, the suppressing effects of sevoflurane on LPS-induced cell death were abrogated by inhibiting autophagy. Moreover, we evidenced that sevoflurane promoted activation of the AMPK/ULK1 pathway in LPS-induced ALI models. Blockage of this pathway abrogated the promoting effects of sevoflurane on cell autophagy and cell viability in LPS-treated cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, sevoflurane suppresses apoptosis and inflammation via activating protective autophagy, thereby ameliorating LPS-induced ALI, and the AMPK/ULK1/ PIKFYVE pathway is responsible for the process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HCMV-miR-US33-5p promotes apoptosis of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells by targeting EPAS1/SLC3A2 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35596131/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35596131/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD), increased vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis has been found. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-miR-US33-5p was significantly increased in the plasma of patients with AAD. However, the roles of miR-US33-5p in human aortic VSMC (HA-VSMC) apoptosis remain to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In the current study, cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry, cell proliferation by CCK-8 assay, and differentially expressed genes by RNA sequencing. Luciferase reporter assay was used for binding analysis between miR-US33-5p and endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1), and EPAS1 and amino acid transporter heavy chain, member 2 (SLC3A2). The enrichment degree of SLC3A2 promoter DNA was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting were performed for measuring messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; It was found that HCMV infection inhibited proliferation but promoted HA-VSMC apoptosis by upregulating HCMV-miR-US33-5p. Transfection of HCMV-miR-US33-5p mimics the significant effect on several signaling pathways including integrin signaling as shown in the RNA sequencing data. Western blotting analysis confirmed that HCMV-miR-US33-5p mimics suppression of the activity of key factors of the integrin signal pathway including FAK, AKT, CAS, and Rac. Mechanistic study showed that HCMV-miR-US33-5p bound to the 3&amp;rsquo;-untranslated region of EPAS1 to suppress its expression, leading to suppression of SLC3A2 expression, which ultimately promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation. This was confirmed by the findings that silencing EPAS1 significantly reduced the SLC3A2 expression and inhibited proliferation and key factors of integrin signal pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; HCMV-miR-US33-5p suppressed proliferation, key factors of integrin signal pathway, and EPAS1/SLC3A2 expression, but promoted HA-VSMC apoptosis. These findings highlighted the importance of HCMV-miR-US33-5p/EPAS1/SCL3A2 signaling and may provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for AAD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>miR-142-5p Encapsulated by Serum-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Protects against Acute Lung Injury in Septic Rats following Remote Ischemic Preconditioning via the PTEN/PI3K/Akt Axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35588695/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study intends to investigate the effects of miR-142-5p encapsulated by serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) on septic acute lung injury (ALI) following remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) through a PTEN-involved mechanism. ALI was induced in rats by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, 24 h before which RIPC was performed via the left lower limb. Next, the binding affinity between miR-142-5p and PTEN was identified. EVs were isolated from serum and injected into rats. The morphology of lung tissues, pulmonary edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration into lung tissues were then assessed, and TNF-α and IL-6 levels in serum and lung tissues were measured. The results indicated that RIPC could attenuate ALI in sepsis. miR-142-5p expression was increased in serum, lung tissues, and serum-derived EVs of ALI rats following RIPC. miR-142-5p could target PTEN to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. miR-142-5p shuttled by serum-derived EVs reduced pulmonary edema, neutrophil infiltration, and TNF-α and IL-6 levels, thus alleviating ALI in LPS-induced septic rats upon RIPC. Collectively, serum-derived EVs-loaded miR-142-5p downregulated PTEN and activated PI3K/Akt to inhibit ALI in sepsis following RIPC, thus highlighting potential therapeutic molecular targets against ALI in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Relationship between impaired BMP signalling and clinical risk factors at early-stage vascular injury in the preterm infant</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35580897/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic lung disease, that is, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication in preterm infants and develops as a consequence of the misguided formation of the gas-exchange area undergoing prenatal and postnatal injury. Subsequent vascular disease and its progression into pulmonary arterial hypertension critically determines long-term outcome in the BPD infant but lacks identification of early, disease-defining changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We link impaired bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling to the earliest onset of vascular pathology in the human preterm lung and delineate the specific effects of the most prevalent prenatal and postnatal clinical risk factors for lung injury mimicking clinically relevant conditions in a multilayered animal model using wild-type and transgenic neonatal mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrate (1) the significant reduction in BMP receptor 2 (BMPR2) expression at the onset of vascular pathology in the lung of preterm infants, later mirrored by reduced plasma BMP protein levels in infants with developing BPD, (2) the rapid impairment (and persistent change) of BMPR2 signalling on postnatal exposure to hyperoxia and mechanical ventilation, aggravated by prenatal cigarette smoke in a preclinical mouse model and (3) a link to defective alveolar septation and matrix remodelling through platelet derived growth factor-receptor alpha deficiency. In a treatment approach, we partially reversed vascular pathology by BMPR2-targeted treatment with FK506 in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We identified impaired BMP signalling as a hallmark of early vascular disease in the injured neonatal lung while outlining its promising potential as a future biomarker or therapeutic target in this growing, high-risk patient population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting SNORA38B attenuates tumorigenesis and sensitizes immune checkpoint blockade in non-small cell lung cancer by remodeling the tumor microenvironment via regulation of GAB2/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35577506/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), are widely involved in the physiological and pathological processes of human beings. While up to date, although considerable progress has been achieved in ncRNA-related pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the underlying mechanisms and biological significance of snoRNAs in NSCLC still need to be further clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or RNAscope was performed to verify the expression of Small Nucleolar RNA, H/ACA Box 38B (SNORA38B) in NSCLC cell lines or clinical samples. BALB/c nude mice xenograft model or C57BL/6J mice syngeneic tumor model were estimated to detect the effects of SNORA38B in tumor growth or tumor immune microenvironment in vivo. Cytometry by time of flight, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry assay were conducted to clarify the effects and mechanisms of SNORA38B-mediated tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The binding activity between SNORA38B and E2F transcription factor 1(E2F1) was detected by RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays. Then, bioinformatics analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation were utilized to demonstrate the regulation of GRB2-associated-binding protein 2 (GAB2) by E2F1. Moreover, the combinatorial treatment of SNORA38B locked nucleic acid (LNA) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) was used to treat murine Lewis lung carcinoma-derived tumor burden C57BL/6J mice to clarify the effectiveness of targeting SNORA38B in NSCLC immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; SNORA38B was found highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and associated with worse prognosis. Further results showed that SNORA38B functioned as an oncogene via facilitating cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and inhibiting cell apoptosis in vitro and promoting tumorigenesis of NSCLC cells in vivo. SNORA38B could also recruit the CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells by triggering tumor cells to secrete interleukin 10, which in turn reduced the infiltration of CD3+CD8+ T cells in NSCLC tumor microenvironment (TME), favoring tumor progression and poorer immune efficacy. Mechanistically, SNORA38B mainly distributed in the nucleus, and promoted NSCLC progression by regulating GAB2 transcription to activate protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway through directly binding with E2F1. Moreover, we found that SNORA38B LNAs were able to ameliorate CD3+CD8+ T cell infiltration in TME, which sensitized NSCLC to the treatment of ICB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In conclusion, our data demonstrated that SNORA38B functioned as an oncogene in NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo at least in part by regulating the GAB2/AKT/mTOR pathway via directly binding to E2F1. SNORA38B could also sensitize NSCLC to immunotherapy, which may be a critical therapeutic target for NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comparative whole-genome transcriptome analysis in renal cell populations reveals high tissue specificity of MAPK/ERK targets in embryonic kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35550069/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; MAPK/ERK signaling is a well-known mediator of extracellular stimuli controlling intracellular responses to growth factors and mechanical cues. The critical requirement of MAPK/ERK signaling for embryonic stem cell maintenance is demonstrated, but specific functions in progenitor regulation during embryonic development, and in particular kidney development remain largely unexplored. We previously demonstrated MAPK/ERK signaling as a key regulator of kidney growth through branching morphogenesis and normal nephrogenesis where it also regulates progenitor expansion. Here, we performed RNA sequencing-based whole-genome expression analysis to identify transcriptional MAPK/ERK targets in two distinct renal populations: the ureteric bud epithelium and the nephron progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our analysis revealed a large number (5053) of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in nephron progenitors and significantly less (1004) in ureteric bud epithelium, reflecting likely heterogenicity of cell types. The data analysis identified high tissue-specificity, as only a fraction (362) of MAPK/ERK targets are shared between the two tissues. Tissue-specific MAPK/ERK targets participate in the regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism in nephron progenitors, which fail to maintain normal mitochondria numbers in the MAPK/ERK-deficient tissue. In the ureteric bud epithelium, a dramatic decline in progenitor-specific gene expression was detected with a simultaneous increase in differentiation-associated genes, which was not observed in nephron progenitors. Our experiments in the genetic model of MAPK/ERK deficiency provide evidence that MAPK/ERK signaling in the ureteric bud maintains epithelial cells in an undifferentiated state. Interestingly, the transcriptional targets shared between the two tissues studied are over-represented by histone genes, suggesting that MAPK/ERK signaling regulates cell cycle progression and stem cell maintenance through chromosome condensation and nucleosome assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Using tissue-specific MAPK/ERK inactivation and RNA sequencing in combination with experimentation in embryonic kidneys, we demonstrate here that MAPK/ERK signaling maintains ureteric bud tip cells, suggesting a regulatory role in collecting duct progenitors. We additionally deliver new mechanistic information on how MAPK/ERK signaling regulates progenitor maintenance through its effects on chromatin accessibility and energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

Sipeimine is a steroidal alkaloid isolated from Fritillaria roylei which has been associated with anti-inflammatory, antitussive and antiasthmatic properties. In this study, we explored the potential effects of sipeimine against PM2.5-induced lung injury in Sprague Dawley rats. Sipeimine alleviated lung injury caused by PM2.5 and decreased pulmonary edema, inflammation and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In addition, sipeimine upregulated the glutathione (GSH) expression and downregulated the expression of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), tissue iron and malondialdehyde (MDA). The downregulation of proteins involved in ferroptosis, including nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) was reversed by sipeimine. The administration of RSL3, a potent ferroptosis-triggering agent, blocked the effects of sipeimine. Using network pharmacology, we found that the effects of sipeimine were presumably mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway. A PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) blocked the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and reversed the effects of sipeimine. Overall, this study suggested that the protective effect of sipeimine against PM2.5-induced lung injury was mainly mediated through the PI3K/Akt pathway, ultimately leading to a reduction in ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEAD/H-box proteins are the largest family of RNA helicases in mammalian genomes, and they are present in all kingdoms of life. Since their discovery in the late 1980s, DEAD/H-box family proteins have been a major focus of study. They have been found to play central roles in RNA metabolism, gene expression, signal transduction, programmed cell death, and the immune response to bacterial and viral infections. Aberrant functions of DEAD/H-box proteins have been implicated in a wide range of human diseases that include cancer, neurodegeneration, and inherited genetic disorders. In this review, we provide a historical context and discuss the molecular functions of DEAD/H-box proteins, highlighting the recent discoveries linking their dysregulation to human diseases. We will also discuss the state of knowledge regarding two specific DEAD/H-box proteins that have critical roles in immune responses and programmed cell death, DDX3X and DDX58, also known as RIG-I. Given their importance in homeostasis and disease, an improved understanding of DEAD/H-box protein biology and protein-protein interactions will be critical for informing strategies to counteract the pathogenesis associated with several human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The gut microbiota prime systemic antiviral immunity via the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35545033/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppression of gut microbiota renders mice susceptible to systemic viral infections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gut microbiota drive systemic antiviral immunity via IFN-I priming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbiota-driven IFN-I priming involves the cGAS-STING axis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbiota mediate systemic IFN-I priming via DNA-containing membrane vesicles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbiota are vital for immune homeostasis and provide a competitive barrier to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Here, we investigated how gut commensals modulate systemic immunity and response to viral infection. Antibiotic suppression of the gut microbiota reduced systemic tonic type I interferon (IFN-I) and antiviral priming. The microbiota-driven tonic IFN-I-response was dependent on cGAS-STING but not on TLR signaling or direct host-bacteria interactions. Instead, membrane vesicles (MVs) from extracellular bacteria activated the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis by delivering bacterial DNA into distal host cells. DNA-containing MVs from the gut microbiota were found in circulation and promoted the clearance of both DNA (herpes simplex virus type 1) and RNA (vesicular stomatitis virus) viruses in a cGAS-dependent manner. In summary, this study establishes an important role for the microbiota in peripheral cGAS-STING activation, which promotes host resistance to systemic viral infections. Moreover, it uncovers an underappreciated risk of antibiotic use during viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting DCLK1 overcomes 5-fluorouracil resistance in colorectal cancer through inhibiting CCAR1/β-catenin pathway-mediated cancer stemness</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35522902/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35522902/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; To date, 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is very important for locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). However, chemotherapy resistance results in tumor recurrence and metastasis, which is a major obstacle for treatment of CRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In the current research, we establish 5-fluorouracil resistant cell lines and explore the potential targets associated with 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC. Moreover, we perform clinical specimen research, in vitro and in vivo experiments and molecular mechanism research, to reveal the biological effects and the mechanism of DCLK1 promoting 5-fluorouracil resistance, and to clarify the potential clinical value of DCLK1 as a target of 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We discover that doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), a cancer stem cell maker, is correlated with 5-fluorouracil resistance, and functionally promotes cancer stemness and 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC. Mechanistically, we elucidate that DCLK1 interacts with cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) through the C-terminal domain, and phosphorylates CCAR1 at the Ser343 site, which is essential for CCAR1 stabilisation. Moreover, we find that DCLK1 positively regulates β-catenin signalling via CCAR1, which is responsible for maintaining cancer stemness. Subsequently, we prove that blocking β-catenin inhibits DCLK1-mediated 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that DCLK1 inhibitor could block CCAR1/β-catenin pathway-mediated cancer stemness and consequently suppresses 5-fluorouracil resistant CRC cells in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, our findings reveal that DCLK1 promotes 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC by CCAR1/β-catenin pathway-mediated cancer stemness, and suggest that targeting DCLK1 might be a promising method to eliminate cancer stem cells for overcoming 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) interacts with Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling in obstructed kidneys in vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35525270/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35525270/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follistatin (FS)-like 1 (FSTL1) is a member of the FS-SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) family of secreted and extracellular matrix proteins. The functions of FSTL1 have been studied in heart and lung injury as well as in wound healing; however, the role of FSTL1 in the kidney is largely unknown. Here, we show using single-cell RNA-Seq that Fstl1 was enriched in stromal cells in obstructed mouse kidneys. In addition, immunofluorescence demonstrated that FSTL1 expression was induced in fibroblasts during kidney fibrogenesis in mice and human patients. We demonstrate that FSTL1 overexpression increased renal fibrosis and activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, known to promote kidney fibrosis, but not the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), Notch, Hedgehog, or Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathways in obstructed mouse kidneys, whereas inhibition of FSTL1 lowered Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Importantly, we show that FSTL1 interacted with Wnt ligands and the Frizzled (FZD) receptors but not the coreceptor lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). Specifically, we found FSTL1 interacted with Wnt3a through its extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain and von Willebrand factor type C-like (VWC) domain, and with FZD4 through its EC domain. Furthermore, we show that FSTL1 increased the association of Wnt3a with FZD4 and promoted Wnt/β-catenin signaling and fibrogenesis. The EC domain interacting with both Wnt3a and FZD4 also enhanced Wnt3a signaling. Therefore, we conclude that FSTL1 is a novel extracellular enhancer of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Korean Red Ginseng water extract inhibits cadmium-induced lung injury via suppressing MAPK/ERK1/2/AP-1 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36090678/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Few studies reported the therapeutic effect of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) in lung inflammatory diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory role and underlying molecular in cadmium-induced lung injury have been poorly understood, directly linked to chronic lung diseases (CLDs): chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer etc. Therefore, in this study we aim to investigate the therapeutic activities of water extract of KRG (KRG-WE) in mouse cadmium-induced lung injury model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Method:&lt;/em&gt; The anti-inflammatory roles and underlying mechanisms of KRG-WE were evaluated in vitro under cadmium-stimulated lung epithelial cells (A549) and HEK293T cell line and in vivo in cadmium-induced lung injury mouse model using semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), luciferase assay, immunoblotting, and FACS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; KRG-WE strongly ameliorated the symptoms of CdSO4-induced lung injury in mice according to total cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and severity scores as well as cytokine levels. KRG-WE significantly suppressed the upregulation of inflammatory signaling comprising mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and their upstream enzymes. In in vitro study, KRG-WE suppressed expression of interleukin (IL)-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and IL-8 while promoting recovery in CdSO4-treated A549 cells. Similarly, KRG-WE reduced phosphorylation of MAPK and c-Jun/c-Fos in cadmium-exposed A549 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; KRG-WE was found to attenuate symptoms of cadmium-induced lung injury and reduce the expression of inflammatory genes by suppression of MAPK/AP-1-mediated pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hydnocarpin D attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via MAPK/NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35537248/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a complex pulmonary destructive disease with limited therapeutic approaches. Hydnocarpin D (HD) is a flavonolignan isolated from Hydnocarpus wightiana which possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether HD has beneficial effects on ALI as well as its underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study evaluated the protective effect of HD in ALI and the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, the role of HD on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice was tested by determination of neutrophil infiltration, levels of inflammatory cytokines, lung histology and edema, vascular and alveolar barrier disruption. In vitro, murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms RESULTS: Administration of HD protected mice against LPS-induced ALI, including ameliorating the histological alterations in the lung tissues, and decreasing lung edema, protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, infiltration of inflammatory cell and secretion of cytokines. Moreover, HD blocked the phosphorylation of TLR-4, NF-κB, and ERK in LPS-induced lung injury. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, HD inhibited LPS-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells, which largely depend upon the upregulation of antioxidant defensive Nrf2 pathway, thereby suppressing LPS-activated proinflammatory mediator secretion, NLRP3 inflammasome, and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; HD attenuates oxidative stress and inflammation against LPS-induced ALI via MAPK/NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, and is a promising novel therapeutic candidate for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influenza A virus NS1 protein hijacks YAP/TAZ to suppress TLR3-mediated innate immune response</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35503798/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hippo signaling pathway, which is historically considered as a dominator of organ development and homeostasis has recently been implicated as an immune regulator. However, its role in host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) has not been widely investigated. Here, we found that IAV could activate the Hippo effectors Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) through physical binding of the IAV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) with C-terminal domain of YAP/TAZ, facilitating their nuclear location. Meanwhile, YAP/TAZ downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral cytokines against IAV infection, therefore benefiting virus replication and host cell apoptosis. A mouse model of IAV infection further demonstrated Yap deficiency protected mice against IAV infection, relieving lung injury. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ blocked anti-viral innate immune signaling via downregulation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) expression. YAP directly bound to the putative TEADs binding site on the promoter region of TLR3. The elimination of acetylated histone H3 occupancy in the TLR3 promoter resulted in its transcriptional silence. Moreover, treatment of Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor or disruption of HDAC4/6 reversed the inhibition of TLR3 expression by YAP/TAZ, suggesting HDAC4/6 mediated the suppression function of YAP/TAZ. Taken together, we uncovered a novel immunomodulatory mechanism employed by IAV, where YAP/TAZ antagonize TLR3-mediated innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pirfenidone ameliorates early pulmonary fibrosis in LPS-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome by inhibiting endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition via the Hedgehog signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35504205/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pirfenidone(PFD) treatment can inhibit the progress of pulmonary fibrosis and notably reduce the mortality of ARDS mice in early stage of ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PFD reduces early pulmonary fibrosis stimulated by LPS, which is related to the inhibition of EndMT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PFD may ameliorate LPS-induced ARDS by regulating the HH signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary vascular endothelial dysfunction is a key pathogenic mechanism in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in fibrosis in lung tissues, including in the context of COVID-19. Pirfenidone (PFD) has become a novel therapeutic agent for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and can improve lung function, inhibit fibrosis and inhibit inflammation. Recently, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) was shown to play a crucial role in various respiratory diseases. However, the role of PFD in the course of EndMT in LPS-induced ARDS remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the anti-EndMT effects of PFD on pulmonary fibrosis after LPS-induced ARDS. First, we determined that PFD significantly reduced LPS-induced ARDS, as shown by significant pathological alterations, and alleviated the oxidative stress and inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, PFD decreased pulmonary fibrosis in LPS-induced ARDS by inhibiting EndMT and reduced the expression levels of Hedgehog (HH) pathway target genes, such as Gli1 and α-SMA, after LPS induction. In summary, this study confirmed that inhibiting the HH pathway by PFD could decrease pulmonary fibrosis by downregulating EndMT in LPS-induced ARDS. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PFD is a promising agent to attenuate pulmonary fibrosis following ARDS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel β-catenin/BCL9 complex inhibitor blocks oncogenic Wnt signaling and disrupts cholesterol homeostasis in colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of many human cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), making it an attractive clinical target. With the aim of inhibiting oncogenic Wnt activity, we developed a high-throughput screening AlphaScreen assay to identify selective small-molecule inhibitors of the interaction between β-catenin and its coactivator BCL9. We identified a compound that consistently bound to β-catenin and specifically inhibited in vivo native β-catenin/BCL9 complex formation in CRC cell lines. This compound inhibited Wnt activity, down-regulated expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signature in gene expression studies, disrupted cholesterol homeostasis, and significantly reduced the proliferation of CRC cell lines and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of CRC. This study has therefore identified a specific small-molecule inhibitor of oncogenic Wnt signaling, which may have value as a probe for functional studies and has important implications for the development of novel therapies in patients with CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of ITPR3 in colorectal cancer cells inhibits metastatic liver colonization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RELB acts downstream of ITPR3/calcium to promote colorectal cancer liver metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITPR3 and RELB regulate survival in response to hypoxia and substratum detachment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure of colorectal cancer cells to ITPR3 inhibitor caffeine reduces liver metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metastatic colonization is the primary cause of death from colorectal cancer (CRC). We employed genome-scale in vivo short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening and validation to identify 26 promoters of CRC liver colonization. Among these genes, we identified a cluster that contains multiple targetable genes, including ITPR3, which promoted liver-metastatic colonization and elicited similar downstream gene expression programs. ITPR3 is a caffeine-sensitive inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor that releases calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and enhanced metastatic colonization by inducing expression of RELB, a transcription factor that is associated with non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Genetic, cell biological, pharmacologic, and clinical association studies revealed that ITPR3 and RELB drive CRC colony formation by promoting cell survival upon substratum detachment or hypoxic exposure. RELB was sufficient to drive colonization downstream of ITPR3. Our findings implicate the ITPR3/calcium/RELB axis in CRC metastatic colony formation and uncover multiple clinico-pathologically associated targetable proteins as drivers of CRC metastatic colonization.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TLR2/caspase-5/Panx1 pathway mediates necrosis-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages during acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35473933/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by necroinflammation formed by necrotic tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and interstitial inflammation. In necroinflammation, macrophages are key inflammatory cells and can be activated and polarized into proinflammatory macrophages. Membranous Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can cooperate with intracellular NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) to recognize danger signals from necrotic TECs and activate proinflammatory macrophages by assembling NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the cooperation between TLRs and NLRP3 is still unclear. Using conditioned medium from necrotic TECs, we confirmed that necrotic TECs could release danger signals to activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. We further identified that necrotic TECs-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation was dependent on ATP secretion via Pannexin-1 (Panx1) channel in macrophages. Next, we verified that TLR2 was required for the activation of Panx1 and NLRP3 in macrophages. Mechanistically, we indicated that caspase-5 mediated TLR2-induced Panx1 activation. In addition, we showed that necrotic TECs-induced activation of TLR2/caspase-5/Panx1 axis could be decreased in macrophages when TECs was protected by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Overall, we demonstrate that danger signals from necrotic TECs could activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages via TLR2/caspase-5/Panx1 axis during AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cineole alleviates the BPA-inhibited NETs formation by regulating the p38 pathway-mediated programmed cell death</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35483150/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPA inhibited the release of NETs by inducing necroptosis and apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CIN can alleviate the oxidative stress and programmed cell death induced by BPA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CIN via p38 pathway alleviates BPA-induced neutrophil injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enriched the research on toxicology of BPA and detoxification mechanism of CIN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor, that can cause immune dysfunction. Cineole (CIN) has that effect of regulating immune function and resist oxidation. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are one of the ways to resist pathogen invasion. In order to explore the effects of BPA and CIN on the release of chicken NETs and the antagonistic effect of CIN, take chicken peripheral blood neutrophils as object of study, grouping as NC, CIN, BPA + CIN and BPA. SEM, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, Western-blot and other methods were used to detect related indicators. The results showed that BPA inhibited the activities of GPX, SOD and CAT, increased the contents of MDA and NO, increased the activity of iNOS. BPA exposure inhibited the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE) and histone, and inhibited the release of NETs. BPA activated downstream apoptosis and necroptosis through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) pathway, which increased the expression of cytochrome C (CytC), bcl-2 associated K protein gene (bak), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3 (caspase-3), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 9 (caspase-9), receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), decreased the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2). However, the co-exposure of CIN and BPA partially recovered the release of NETs, alleviated BPA-induced oxidative stress, and inhibited the activation of p38-MAPK pathway, necroptosis, and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. These results indicated that CIN modulated p38 pathway alleviated BPA-induced neutrophil necroptosis and apoptosis, and increased NETs formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Melatonin attenuates LPS-induced pyroptosis in acute lung injury by inhibiting NLRP3-GSDMD pathway via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35468366/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin alleviates LPS-induced lung injury and edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin prolongs the survival rates of mice suffered from lethal doses of LPS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin attenuates NLRP3/GADMD pathway-driven pyroptosis via inhibiting oxidative stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin inhibits LPS-induced ALI through regulating the feasible interactions between Nrf2 signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/ acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is featured by intensive inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, which lead to cytokine storms and pyroptosis. Here, we aimed to investigate whether melatonin was capable of alleviating LPS-induced ALI via activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 (Nrf2/HO-1) signaling axis and inhibiting pyroptosis. Mice were injected with melatonin (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for consecutive five days before LPS instillation intratracheally, and human alveolar epithelial cell (AECⅡ) A549 cell lines and murine macrophages Raw264.7 cell lines were pretreated with melatonin (400 μM) before LPS (10 μg/ml) stimulation. The result demonstrated that LPS induced obvious lung injury characterized by alveolar damage, neutrophil infiltration and lung edema as well as the reduction of the survival rate of mice, which were totally reversed by melatonin pretreatment. Mechanistically, melatonin pretreatment activated nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor (Nrf) 2 signaling, subsequently, drove antioxidant pathways including significant increases in the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, Mn-SOD and Catalase in vivo and in vitro. Simultaneously, melatonin inhibited ROS and MDA overproduction, iNOS expression as well as TNF-α and IL-1β expression and release. Furthermore, melatonin inhibited LPS-induced pyroptosis by reversing the overexpression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18 and GSDMD-N, as well as LDH release and TUNEL-positive cells in A549 cells and Raw264.7 cells. Overall, the current study suggests that melatonin exerts protective roles on LPS-induced ALI and pyroptosis by inhibiting NLRP3-GSDMD pathway via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a leading pulmonary inflammatory disorder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vincamine is a novel phytochemical with promising anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vincamine exerted potent suppression of inflammation by reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vincamine reduced the release of nitrite and TNF-α from lipopolysaccharide stimulated Raw 264.7 macrophages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vincamine reduced the expression of NF-κB, TNF-α and COX-2 while increased the expression of Nrf-2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These findings are of potential relevance for COVID-19 related lung injury management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the leading pulmonary inflammatory disorders causing significant morbidity and mortality. Vincamine is a novel phytochemical with promising anti-inflammatory properties. In the current work, the protective effect of vincamine was studied in vitro (Raw 264.7 macrophages) and in vivo against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced ALI in Swiss albino mice. Vincamine significantly reduced nitrite and TNF-α release from the LPS stimulated macrophages and increased the levels of IL-10, indicating potent anti-inflammatory effects. It was observed that vincamine at the dose of 40 mg/kg, significantly reduced LPS induced inflammatory cell count in blood and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Further, vincamine exerted potent suppression of inflammation by reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, while significantly increased (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and IL-22). Interestingly, histological changes were reversed in vincamine treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly enhanced expression of NF-κB, TNF-α and COX-2 while reduced expression of Nrf-2 in disease control group, which were significantly (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) ameliorated by vincamine. We, to the best of our knowledge, report for the first time that vincamine possesses protective potential against LPS induced inflammation and oxidative stress, possibly by inhibiting the NF-κB cascade, while positively regulating the Nrf-2 pathway. These findings are of potential relevance for COVID-19 management concerning the fact that lung injury and ARDS are its critical features.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Novel Identified Circular RNA, mmu_mmu_circRNA_0000309, Involves in Germacrone-Mediated Improvement of Diabetic Nephropathy Through Regulating Ferroptosis by Targeting miR-188-3p/GPX4 Signaling Axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34913724/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34913724/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is characterized by microalbuminuria, mainly associated with pathological and morphological alterations of podocyte. New drug targeting podocyte injury is a promising approach for treating DN. The present study is aimed at developing new drug targeting podocyte injury for treating DN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, germacrone ameliorated kidney damage and inhibited podocyte apoptosis in a DN mouse model. Based on RNA-seq, mmu_mmu_circRNA_0000309, located in host gene vascular endothelial zinc finger 1 (Vezf1), showed a sharp decline in DN mice and a remarkable recovery in germacrone-challenged DN mice. mmu_circRNA_0000309 silence or miR-188-3p mimics abrogated the antiapoptosis and anti-injury effects of germacrone through aggravating mitochondria damage, and elevating reactive oxygen species and ferroptosis-related protein levels. Mechanistically, mmu_circRNA_0000309 competitively sponged miR-188-3p, and subsequently promoted glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression, thereby inactivating ferroptosis-dependent mitochondrial damage and podocyte apoptosis. In addition, GPX4 overexpression neutralized mmu_circRNA_0000309 silence-mediated mitochondria damage and ferroptosis in germacrone-exposed MPC5 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation:&lt;/em&gt; We describe the novel effect and mechanism of germacrone on treating DN, which is linked to ferroptosis for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; mmu_circRNA_0000309 silence mediates drug resistance to germacrone in DN mice. mmu_circRNA_0000309 sponges miR-188-3p, and subsequently upregulates GPX4 expression, inactivating ferroptosis-dependent mitochondrial function and podocyte apoptosis. Possibly germacrone-based treatment for DN can be further motivated by regulating mmu_circRNA_0000309/miR-188-3p/GPX4 signaling axis. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 36, 740-759.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA PCAT1 activates SOX2 and suppresses radioimmune responses via regulating cGAS/STING signalling in non-small cell lung cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35415876/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) prostate cancer-associated ncRNA transcripts 1 (PCAT1) is increased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It stimulates tumour growth and metastasis, but its role in the radioimmune responses remain unknown. We aimed to explore the impacts of PCAT1 on tumorigenesis and radioimmune responses and the underlying molecular mechanisms in NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify immunosuppressive lncRNAs involved with tumour invasion in NSCLC. The expression levels of PCAT1 were analysed by in situ hybridisation in 55 paired NSCLC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Both loss- and gain-of-function assays were performed to examine the effects of PCAT1 and SOX2 on NSCLC cell behaviours in vivo and in vitro. Bioinformatic analyses, chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were applied to validate the regulatory effects of PCAT1 on SOX2 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase and rescue assays were utilised to identify the relationship between SOX2 and the cGAS/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signalling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; PCAT1 was immunosuppressive and related with NSCLC invasion. Increased PCAT1 was negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration in NSCLC. PCAT1 knockdown restrained proliferation, increased apoptosis, and repressed cell metastasis in vivo and in vitro. PCAT1 activated SOX2 that accelerated tumorigenesis and immunosuppression. SOX2 promoted tumour growth through inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell immunity. Moreover, SOX2 restrained cGAS transcription and hampered downstream type I interferon (IFN)-induced immune responses. Inhibition of PCAT1/SOX2 in collaboration with radiation further inhibited tumour growth, and initiated the cGAS/STING signalling pathway, which enhanced the immune responses of radiotherapy in NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; PCAT1/SOX2 axis promoted tumorigenesis and immunosuppression through inhibition of cGAS/STING signalling-mediated T-cell activation. Inhibition of PCAT1 and SOX2 synergised with radiotherapy to activate the immune response and could serve as potential therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Notch pathway attenuates burn-induced acute lung injury in rats by repressing reactive oxygen species</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35441079/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35441079/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This study demonstrated for the first time that the Notch pathway is activated in burn-induced ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROS production and cell apoptosis of PMVECs were closely associated with the Notch signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of the Notch pathway downregulated the expression of ROS and attenuated excessive ROS-induced injury in PMVECs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notch signaling regulated ROS production by modulating the expression of NOX4 rather than NOX2 and SOD1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common complication following severe burns. The underlying mechanisms of ALI are incompletely understood; thus, available treatments are not sufficient to repair the lung tissue after ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate the relationship between the Notch pathway and burn-induced lung injury, we established a rat burn injury model by scalding and verified lung injury via lung injury evaluations, including hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining, lung injury scoring, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and wet/dry ratio analyses, myeloperoxidase immunohistochemical staining and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation analysis. To explore whether burn injury affects Notch1 expression, we detected the expression of Notch1 and Hes1 after burn injury. Then, we extracted pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) and conducted Notch pathway inhibition and activation experiments, via a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) and OP9-DLL1 coculture, respectively, to verify the regulatory effect of the Notch pathway on ROS accumulation and apoptosis in burn-serum-stimulated PMVECs. To investigate the regulatory effect of the Notch pathway on ROS accumulation, we detected the expression of oxidative-stress-related molecules such as superoxide dismutase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) 2, NOX4 and cleaved caspase-3. NOX4-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the inhibitor GKT137831 were used to verify the regulatory effect of the Notch pathway on ROS via NOX4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We successfully established a burn model and revealed that lung injury, excessive ROS accumulation and an inflammatory response occurred. Notch1 detection showed that the expression of Notch1 was significantly increased after burn injury. In PMVECs challenged with burn serum, ROS and cell death were elevated. Moreover, when the Notch pathway was suppressed by GSI, ROS and cell apoptosis levels were significantly increased. Conversely, these parameters were reduced when the Notch pathway was activated by OP9-DLL1. Mechanistically, the inhibition of NOX4 by siRNA and GKT137831 showed that the Notch pathway reduced ROS production and cell apoptosis by downregulating the expression of NOX4 in PMVECs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The Notch pathway reduced ROS production and apoptosis by downregulating the expression of NOX4 in burn-stimulated PMVECs. The Notch-NOX4 pathway may be a novel therapeutic target to treat burn-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine (Dex) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in rats and its mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Eighteen SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (6 rats in each group): control group (intratracheal instillation of saline), ALI group (intratracheal instillation of 5 mg/kg LPS), and ALI-Dex group (tail vein injection of 50 μg/kg/h Dex + intratracheal instillation of LPS). Subsequently, the water content of lung tissues was assessed using the wet-dry (W/D) ratio and the histopathological changes of lung tissues using H&amp;amp;E staining. Further activities of ROS, SOD, and GSH-Px in lung tissues of rats were measured by an automatic biochemistry analyzer. ELISA was performed to detect TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 expression in alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and Western blot to detect the expression of Nrf2/ARE pathway-related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; After Dex treatment, a reduction in water content in lung tissue and an improvement of lung injury were found in the ALI rats. Compared with the ALI group, rats in the ALI-Dex group had decreased ROS activity and increased activities of SOD and GSH-Px in lung tissues. Dex-treated rats were also associated with a decrease in TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 expression in alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Additionally, increased expression levels of HO-1 and NQO1 in lung tissues and elevated expression of Nrf2 in the nucleus were shown in the ALI-Dex group compared with the ALI group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Dex alleviates LPS-induced ALI by activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LATS1 is a central signal transmitter for achieving full type-I interferon activity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35394840/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interferons (IFNs) have broad-spectrum antiviral activity to resist virus epidemic. However, IFN antiviral efficacy needs to be greatly improved. Here, we reveal that LATS1 is a vital signal transmitter governing full type-I IFN (IFN-I) signaling activity. LATS1 constitutively binds with the IFN-I receptor IFNAR2 and is rapidly tyro-phosphorylated by Tyk2 upon IFN-I engagement. Tyro-phosphorylation of LATS1 promotes LATS1 activation and YAP degradation, thereby promoting IFN-mediated antiproliferation activity. Moreover, activated LATS1 translocates into the nucleus and induces CDK8-Ser62 phosphorylation, which in turn phosphorylates STAT1 at Ser&lt;sup&gt;727&lt;/sup&gt; and induces full IFN-I antiviral activity. LATS1 deficiency restricts in vivo IFN-I signaling and attenuates host antiviral immune response. Our study identifies IFN-I as a previously unidentified extracellular diffusible ligand signal for activation of the Hippo core LATS1 pathway and reveals Tyk2-LATS1-CDK8 as a complete signaling cascade controlling full IFN-I activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor attenuates acute lung injury via inhibiting macrophages&#39; activation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MANF was up-regulated in inflammatory lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MANF deficiency in macrophages induced lung inflammation and aggravated LPS-induced lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recombinant human MANF attenuated LPS-induced lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MANF deficiency in macrophages promoted macrophages to M1differentiation in lung tissues of ALI mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recombinant human MANF restricted macrophages to M1 differentiation in lung tissues of ALI mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is an urgent respiratory disease without effective treatment. Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF)has been demonstrated to play a suppressive role in some inflammatory conditions. However, the effect of MANF on ALI has not yet been reported. In this study, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the patients with or without pulmonary inflammation, and used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce mice ALI model. Mono-macrophage-specific MANF knockout (MKO) mice were constructed and recombinant human MANF protein was used to ALI mice. We found that the endogenous MANF protein in both human BALF and mice lung tissues was increased in inflammatory conditions. MANF level in the macrophages of inflammatory lung was higher than that in normal controls in both human and mice. MANF deficiency in macrophages induced lung inflammation and aggravated LPS-induced lung injury. MANF lowered LPS-induced lung injury, inhibited macrophage polarization to M1 functional type. Meanwhile, MANF inhibited-LPS induced activation of NF-κB signal pathway by down regulating phosphorylated p65in lung tissue and macrophages. These results indicate that MANF acts as a suppressor in ALI via negatively regulating NF-κB activation and macrophages polarization, which may be a novel potential target and shed light on ALI therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondria bridge HIF signaling and ferroptosis blockage in acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35387983/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, plays an important role in acute kidney injury (AKI). Previous studies have shown that prolyl hydroxylase domain protein (PHD) inhibitors that activate HIF signaling provide strong protection against AKI, which is characterized by marked cell death. However, the relationship between PHD inhibition/HIF signaling and ferroptosis in AKI has not been elucidated. Here, we review recent studies to explore the issue. First, we will review the literature concerning the functions of HIF in promoting mitophagy, suppressing mitochondrial respiration and modulating redox homeostasis. Second, we will describe the current understanding of ferroptosis and its role in AKI, particularly from the perspective of mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, we will discuss the possibility that mitochondria link PHD inhibition/HIF signaling and ferroptosis in AKI. In conclusion, we propose that HIF may protect renal cells against ferroptosis in AKI by reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress and damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferroptosis plays an important role in the development of AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of HIF signaling provides protection against AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitochondrial ROS facilitate ferroptosis in many cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HIF signaling regulates multiple mitochondrial activities, including mitochondrial oxidative capacity, redox homeostasis and autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can HIF signaling alleviate ferroptosis in AKI with different etiologies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is mitochondrial pathway decisive for HIF-offered protection in situations like AKI, given that HIF signaling has extensive downstream effects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would PHD inhibitors be effective in AKI prevention and treatment clinically?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Pro-Resolving Mediator Resolvin E1 Restores Alveolar Fluid Clearance in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35271545/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier and impaired alveolar fluid clearance. Resolvin E1 (RvE1) is a specialized pro-resolving mediator derived endogenously from omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids. RvE1 (10 μg/kg i.v.) was injected to rats 6 h post-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (14 mg/kg) induction. After another 3 h, alveolar fluid clearance was measured in live rats (n = 8-9). The primary Type II alveolar epithelial cell was isolated and treated by LPS (1 μg/mL) with or without RvE1 (250 nM). The expression of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase (NKA), AKT, serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1), and Nedd4-2 were detected. RvE1 improved survival rate (30% vs. 70%, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.048), increased the clearance of alveolar fluid (13.34% vs. 18.73%, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), reduced lung wet-dry weight ratio (5.01 vs. 4.63, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), mitigated lung injury scores (13.38 vs. 7.0, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and inflammation in LPS-induced ARDS in rats. RvE1 upregulated alveolar ENaC and NKA expression &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, RvE1 significantly increased the expression of phosphorylated AKT, SGK1, and phosphorylated Nedd4-2 in LPS-stimulated primary alveolar type II cells. The effects of RvE1 were abrogated by blocking phosphatidylinositide3&amp;rsquo;-kinase (PI3K) and SGK1 with LY294002 and GSK650394, respectively. In summary, RvE1 upregulated ENaC and NKA expression by activating PI3K/AKT/SGK1 pathway to promote alveolar fluid clearance, suggesting that RvE1 may be a potentially effective drug for ARDS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NEDD4 attenuates phosgene-induced acute lung injury through the inhibition of Notch1 activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35355403/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosgene gas leakage can cause life-threatening acute lung injury (ALI), which is characterized by inflammation, increased vascular permeability, pulmonary oedema and oxidative stress. Although the downregulation of neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (NEDD4) is known to be associated with inflammation and oxidative damage, its functions in phosgene-induced ALI remain unclear. In this study, rats with phosgene-induced ALI were intravenously injected with NEDD4-overexpressing lentiviruses to determine the functions of NEDD4 in this inflammatory condition. NEDD4 expression was decreased in the lung parenchyma of phosgene-exposed control rats, whereas its expression level was high in the NEDD4-overexpressing rats. Phosgene exposure increased the wet-to-dry lung weight ratio, but NEDD4 abrogated this effect. NEDD4 overexpression attenuated phosgene-induced lung inflammation, lowering the high lung injury score (based on total protein, inflammatory cells and inflammatory factors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) and also reduced phosgene-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. Finally, NEDD4 was found to interact with Notch1, enhancing its ubiquitination and thereby its degradation, thus attenuating the inflammatory responses to ALI. Therefore, we demonstrated that NEDD4 plays a protective role in alleviating phosgene-induced ALI, suggesting that enhancing the effect of NEDD4 may be a new approach for treating phosgene-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TnBP and TBOEP caused pulmonary damages by inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fkbp5&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Nos3&lt;/em&gt;/MAPK/NF-κB signal pathway was upregulated when exposing to TnBP and TBOEP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TnBP aggravated OVA induced asthmatic inflammatory response with overexpression of IgE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TnBP facilitated OVA-induced asthma by upregulating PI3K/Akt/NF-кB signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkyl organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), are ubiquitously detected in indoor and outdoor environments and their inhalation may result in lung damage. This study examined pulmonary toxicity after exposure to TnBP or TBOEP and investigated aggravation of inflammation and immunoreaction by TnBP in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mice model. Transcriptomics were used to further reveal the underlying mechanism. Exposure to TnBP or TBOEP resulted in pathological damage, including edema and thickened alveolar septum. In comparison with the control, enhanced levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01 in TnBP (High) group and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 in TBOEP (High) group), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), malondialdehyde (MDA) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), and cytokines under a dose-dependent relationship were noted, and the expression of the Fkbp5/Nos3/MAPK/NF-кB signaling pathway (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) was upregulated in the TnBP and TBOEP groups. Moreover, the combined exposure of TnBP and OVA exacerbated the allergic inflammatory response, including airway hyperresponsiveness, leukocytosis, cellular exudation and infiltration, secretion of inflammatory mediators, and higher expression of IgE (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Transcriptomics results demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt/NF-кB signal pathway was involved in TnBP-aggravated asthmatic mice. Exposure to TnBP or TBOEP resulted in oxidative damage and leukocyte-induced lung injury. TnBP can further facilitate OVA-induced asthma through an inflammatory response. This study is the first to reveal the pulmonary toxicity and potential mechanism induced by OPFRs through an in-vivo model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>lncRNA MEG3 restrained the M1 polarization of microglia in acute spinal cord injury through the HuR/A20/NF-κB axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammation restrict the treatment of acute spinal cord injury (ASCI), and long non-coding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) expression is lessened in ASCI. However, the function and mechanism of lncRNA MEG3 in the M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammation in ASCI are unclear. The expressions of lncRNA MEG3 in ASCI mouse spinal cord tissues and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated primary microglia and BV2 cells were quantified through a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. In-vitro assays were conducted to explore the function of lncRNA MEG3 in the M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammation in ASCI. RNA degradation, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, cycloheximide-chase, and ubiquitination analyses were carried out to probe into the mechanism of lncRNA MEG3 in the M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammation in ASCI. The lncRNA MEG3 expression was lessened in the ASCI mouse spinal cord tissues and LPS-treated primary microglia and BV2 cells, and the overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 restrained the M1 polarization of microglia and the neuroinflammation by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. For the investigation of the potential mechanism of such, the overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 restrained the M1 polarization of microglia through the HuR/A20/NF-κB axis and boosted the motor function recovery and neuroinflammation relief in the mice with SCI. The overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 restrained the M1 polarization of microglia through the HuR/A20/NF-κB axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcriptome and chromatin alterations in social fear indicate association of MEG3 with successful extinction of fear</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social anxiety disorder is characterized by a persistent fear and avoidance of social situations, but available treatment options are rather unspecific. Using an established mouse social fear conditioning (SFC) paradigm, we profiled gene expression and chromatin alterations after the acquisition and extinction of social fear within the septum, a brain region important for social fear and social behaviors. Here, we particularly focused on the successful versus unsuccessful outcome of social fear extinction training, which corresponds to treatment responsive versus resistant patients in the clinics. Validation of coding and non-coding RNAs revealed specific isoforms of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Meg3 regulated, depending on the success of social fear extinction. Moreover, PI3K/AKT was differentially activated with extinction success in SFC-mice. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; knockdown of specific Meg3 isoforms increased baseline activity of PI3K/AKT signaling, and mildly delayed social fear extinction. Using ATAC-Seq and CUT&amp;amp;RUN, we found alterations in the chromatin structure of specific genes, which might be direct targets of lncRNA Meg3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GL attenuated inflammatory lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GL reduced the NETs formation in lung tissues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GL inhibited the HMGB1 / TLR9 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GL improved lung function in mice with sepsis-induced ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are involved in the development of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Glycyrrhizin (GL), the main active ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicine Glycyrrhiza glabra, has anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and immunomodulatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; The study aims to explore the efficacy and potential mechanism of GL on sepsis-induced ARDS in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mice were randomly divided into 3 groups: Control, CLP, and GL + CLP. Mice sepsis ARDS model was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) followed by intraperitoneal GL treatment. Then, the 7-day survival rate of mice was recorded. The lung function of mice was determined by whole-body plethysmography. Lung pathology and scores were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The wet/dry ratio (W/D) of the lung was measured by weighing method. The protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was measured by the BCA method. NETs formation in lung tissue was detected by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, HMGB1、TLR9、MyD88 and IL6 expression in lung tissue were detected by western blot and by quantitative real-time PCR, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that GL improved the survival rate, attenuated lung tissue injury and reduced the expression of inflammatory factors in mice with CLP-induced sepsis. Meanwhile, we confirmed that GL could inhibit TLR9 / MyD88 activation from reducing NETs formation by decreasing HMGB1 expression. The formation of NETs is regulated by HMGB1/TLR9/MyD88. In addition, GL improved lung function in mice with sepsis-induced ARDS. Lung function suggested that GL increased alveolar ventilation, alleviated ventilator fatigue and reduced airway resistance in mice with ARDS induced by sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; GL ameliorated sepsis-induced ARDS and reduced the NETs formation in lung tissues, which may be associated with the inhibition of the HMGB1/TLR9 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loss of CLDN5 in podocytes deregulates WIF1 to activate WNT signaling and contributes to kidney disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35332151/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although mature podocytes lack tight junctions, tight junction integral membrane protein claudin-5 (CLDN5) is predominantly expressed on plasma membranes of podocytes under normal conditions. Using podocyte-specific Cldn5 knockout mice, we identify CLDN5 as a crucial regulator of podocyte function and reveal that Cldn5 deletion exacerbates podocyte injury and proteinuria in a diabetic nephropathy mouse model. Mechanistically, CLDN5 deletion reduces ZO1 expression and induces nuclear translocation of ZONAB, followed by transcriptional downregulation of WNT inhibitory factor-1 (WIF1) expression, which leads to activation of WNT signaling pathway. Podocyte-derived WIF1 also plays paracrine roles in tubular epithelial cells, as evidenced by the finding that animals with podocyte-specific deletion of Cldn5 or Wif1 have worse kidney fibrosis after unilateral ureteral obstruction than littermate controls. Systemic delivery of WIF1 suppresses the progression of diabetic nephropathy and ureteral obstruction-induced renal fibrosis. These findings establish a function for podocyte CLDN5 in restricting WNT signaling in kidney.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) Promotes Staphylococcus aureus-Induced Extracellular Traps Formation via the ROS-ERK Signaling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35399524/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35399524/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a cytosolic DNA sensor or directly recognizes bacterial cyclic dinucleotides, which is required for the detection of microbial infection. Extracellular traps (ETs) are known to be part of the antimicrobial defense system. However, the implication of STING in ETs formation during microbial infection remains unknown. Here, we showed that STING contributed to &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;)-induced ETs formation through the ROS-ERK signaling. STING deficiency exhibited decreased cell-free DNA (cfDNA) level, reduced expression of citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), and diminished DNA colocalization with CitH3 and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Interestingly, NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoted ETs formation, accompanied by increased activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Corresponding to less ROS production, decreased ERK1/2 activation was shown in STING-/- BMDMs after &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Importantly, inhibiting the ROS-ERK signal reduced the ETs formation and the differences disappeared between WT and STING&lt;sup&gt;-/&lt;/sup&gt;- BMDMs after &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Moreover, STING&lt;sup&gt;-/&lt;/sup&gt; BMDMs exhibited significantly increased levels of extracellular bacteria compared to WT BMDMs regardless of phagocytosis. In addition, such differences disappeared after DNase I treatment. DNase I treatment also facilitated pathogen colonization without affecting the inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory factors secretion following pulmonary &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Furthermore, STING&lt;sup&gt;-/&lt;/sup&gt; mice presented decreased levels of cfDNA and CitH3, along with increased bacterial colonization compared to WT mice. Altogether, these findings highlighted that STING promoted ETs formation via the ROS-ERK signal for host defense against &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epithelial LIF signaling limits apoptosis and lung injury during bacterial pneumonia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35137631/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During bacterial pneumonia, alveolar epithelial cells are critical for maintaining gas exchange and providing antimicrobial as well as pro-immune properties. We previously demonstrated that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an IL-6 family cytokine, is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATII) and is critical for tissue protection during bacterial pneumonia. However, the target cells and mechanisms of LIF-mediated protection remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that antibody-induced LIF blockade remodels the lung epithelial transcriptome in association with increased apoptosis. Based on these data, we performed pneumonia studies using a novel mouse model in which LIFR (the unique receptor for LIF) is absent in lung epithelium. Although LIFR is expressed on the surface of epithelial cells, its absence only minimally contributed to tissue protection during pneumonia. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) was conducted to identify adult murine lung cell types most prominently expressing &lt;em&gt;Lifr&lt;/em&gt;, revealing endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and ATIIs as major sources of &lt;em&gt;Lifr&lt;/em&gt;. Sequencing data indicated that ATII cells were significantly impacted by pneumonia, with additional differences observed in response to LIF neutralization, including but not limited to gene programs related to cell death, injury, and inflammation. Overall, our data suggest that LIF signaling on epithelial cells alters responses in this cell type during pneumonia. However, our results also suggest separate and perhaps more prominent roles of LIFR in other cell types, such as endothelial cells or mesenchymal cells, which provide grounds for future investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Green tea peptides ameliorate diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35234233/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most important cause of middle and late-stage chronic kidney disease. Green tea polypeptides are extracted from tea pomace, and exhibit various pharmacological effects. In this study, we analyzed the reno-protective effects of green tea peptides in diabetic db/db mice, and explored the underlying mechanisms. Peptide treatment for 5 weeks significantly reduced the blood glucose levels and other indices of diabetes, and alleviated renal injury measured in terms of blood creatinine, urea nitrogen and urinary albumin/urinary creatinine levels. Mechanistically, the green tea peptides downregulated p-Smad2/3, α-SMA, ZO-1 and vimentin proteins in the kidney tissues, and elevated Smad7. Thus, green tea peptides inhibited the deposition of ECM proteins by suppressing excessive activation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway and reducing fibronectin levels. On the other hand, tea peptides ameliorated renal injury by inhibiting the production of inflammatory factors (iNOS and TNF-α) by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, we confirmed the inhibitory effect of green tea peptides on the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway in TGF-β1-stimulated HK-2 cells. Therefore, tea peptides can be considered as an effective candidate for alleviating DN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Renoprotective effect of vinpocetine against ischemia/reperfusion injury: Modulation of NADPH oxidase/Nrf2, IKKβ/NF-κB p65, and cleaved caspase-3 expressions</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35315168/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) during kidney transplantation is a serious clinical problem with a high mortality rate and a lack of therapy. Therefore, there is a need to improve the ability of the kidney to tolerate IRI during transplantation. This study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of vinpocetine; a derivative of vincamine alkaloid; against renal IRI in rats with the elucidation of the involved mechanisms. Vinpocetine (25 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered for 10 successive days before the induction of ischemia by bilateral clamping of both renal pedicles for 45 min followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Blood and renal tissue samples were then collected for biochemical, molecular, and histopathological investigations. Vinpocetine significantly reduced serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels in rats subjected to IRI. It also reduced mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase and renal content of malondialdehyde, while enhanced Nrf2 protein expression and renal content of reduced glutathione. The suppression of the provoked inflammatory response was evident by the downregulation of IKKβ and NF-κB p65 protein expressions, as well as their downstream inflammatory markers; tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and myeloperoxidase. In addition, vinpocetine reduced protein expression of the apoptotic executioner cleaved caspase-3. These nephroprotective effects were confirmed by the improvement in histopathological features. Collectively, the protective effect of vinpocetine against IRI could be attributed to modulation of NADPH oxidase/Nrf2, IKKβ/NF-κB p65, and cleaved caspase-3 expressions. Thus, vinpocetine could improve oxidant/antioxidant balance, suppress triggered inflammatory response, and promote renal cell survival after IRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Combined Transcriptomic and Proteomic Approach to Reveal the Effect of Mogroside V on OVA-Induced Pulmonary Inflammation in Mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mogroside V is a bioactive ingredient extracted from the natural food Siraitia grosvenorii which possesses functions that stimulate lung humidification and cough relief activities, but its underlying mechanisms were rarely studied. To estimate its potential protective effect on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced pulmonary inflammation and understand its system-wide mechanism, integrated omics was applied in this study. Mogroside V effectively reduced the levels of IgE, TNF-α, and IL-5 in OVA-induced mice. The results of RNA-seq and data-independent acquisition proteomics approach revealed that 944 genes and 341 proteins were differentially expressed in the normal control group (NC) and ovalbumin-induced control group (OC) and 449 genes and 259 proteins were differentially expressed between the OC and the group treated with 50 mg/kg mogroside V (MV). After a combined analysis of the transcriptome and the proteome, 93 major pathways were screened, and we discovered that mogroside V exerts an anti-inflammation effect in the lung via NF-κB and JAK-STAT, both of which are among the signaling pathways mentioned above. In addition, we found that the key regulatory molecules (Igha, Ighg1, NF-κB, Jak1, and Stat1) in the two pathways were activated in inflammation and inhibited by mogroside V. Thus, mogroside V may be the main bioactivity component in S. grosvenorii that exerts lung humidification and cough relief effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disorder of mitochondrial dynamic equilibrium of lung epithelial cell is one of the critical causes of acute lung injury (ALI). Kinsenoside (Kin) serves as an active small-molecule component derived from traditional medicinal herb displaying multiple pharmacological actions in cancers, hyperglycemia, and liver disease. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Kin on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ALI and further explore possible molecular mechanisms. Kin was administered orally (100 mg/kg/day) for 7 consecutive days before LPS instillation (5 mg/kg). After 12 hours, pathological injury, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress were detected. The results demonstrated that Kin significantly alleviated lung pathological injury and decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the release of inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), apart from inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Meanwhile, Kin also promoted mitochondrial fusion and restrained mitochondrial fission in mice with ALI. In terms of mechanism, Kin pretreatment increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the protein level of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). In &lt;em&gt;Ampk-α&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice challenged with LPS, Kin lost its pulmonary protective effects, accompanied by lower NRF2 level. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments further unveiled that either AMPK inhibition by Compound C or NRF2 knockdown by siRNA abolished the protective roles of Kin in LPS-treated A549 lung epithelial cells. And NRF2 activator TAT-14 could reverse the effects of &lt;em&gt;Ampk-α&lt;/em&gt; deficiency. In conclusion, Kin possesses the ability to prevent LPS-induced ALI by modulating mitochondrial dynamic equilibrium in lung epithelial cell in an AMPK/NRF2-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emodin Protects Against Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Lung Injury via the JNK/Nur77/c-Jun Signaling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35370650/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious inflammatory disease with clinical manifestations of hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Presently, there is no effective treatment of ALI. Although emodin from Rheum palmatum L. exerts anti-ALI properties, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanism of emodin on LPS-induced ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; RAW264.7 cells and zebrafish larvae were stimulated by LPS to establish inflammatory models. The anti-inflammatory effect of emodin was assessed by ELISA, flow cytometric analysis, and survival analysis. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; mechanisms were explored by using Western blotting, luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach. The acute lung injury model in mice was established by the intratracheal administration of LPS, and the underlying mechanisms were assessed by detecting changes in histopathological and inflammatory markers and Western blotting in lung tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Emodin inhibited the inflammatory factor production and oxidative stress in RAW264.7 cells, and prolonged the survival of zebrafish larvae after LPS stimulation. Emodin suppressed the expression levels of phosphorylated JNK at Thr183/tyr182 and phosphorylated Nur77 at Ser351 and c-Jun, and increased the expression level of Nur77 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, while these regulatory effects of emodin on Nur77/c-Jun were counteracted by JNK activators. The overexpression of JNK dampened the emodin-mediated increase in Nur77 luciferase activity and Nur77 expression. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of emodin on c-Jun can be attenuated by Nur77 siRNA. Furthermore, emodin alleviated LPS-induced ALI in mice through the regulation of the JNK/Nur77/c-Jun pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Emodin protects against LPS-induced ALI through regulation on JNK/Nur77/c-Jun signaling. Our results indicate the potential of emodin in the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanoformulation of a carbon monoxide releasing molecule protects against cyclosporin A-induced nephrotoxicity and renal fibrosis via the suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated TGF-β/Smad pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35304324/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclosporin A (CsA) induced nephrotoxicity i.e., renal fibrosis is a critical clinical problem in renal transplant patients, in which chronic inflammatory response is the major cause. Previously, we developed a nano-drug delivery system for carbon monoxide (CO), a multi-functional gaseous molecule with a potent anti-inflammatory effect, i.e., SMA/CORM2, which showed therapeutic potential in several inflammatory disease models. Accordingly, in this study, we explored the potential and usefulness of SMA/CORM2 on CsA induced renal fibrosis. When mice were exposed to CsA for 4 weeks, severe injuries in the kidney as revealed by decreased kidney function and histological examination, and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as renal fibrosis along with the upregulation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)/Smad signaling molecule were observed, whereas SMA/CORM2 (1 mg/kg) treatment remarkably ameliorated the inflammatory injury and fibrosis in the kidney. CO is the major effector molecule of SMA/CORM2 which significantly suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, and induced the downregulation of TGFβ/Smad signaling. Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome by its inhibitor MCC950 also similarly decreased TGFβ/Smad expression and subsequently improved kidney injury and renal fibrosis, suggesting SMA/CORM2 induced suppression of TGFβ/Smad signaling and renal signaling via an NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pathway. Compared to native CORM2, SMA/CORM2 exhibited better therapeutic/preventive effects owing to its superior water-solubility and bioavailability. These findings strongly indicated the applicability of SMA/CORM2 as an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect-based nanomedicine for CsA induced renal fibrosis as well as other inflammatory diseases. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important gaseous signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in the maintenance of homeostasis. Because of its versatile functions, it exhibits the potential as the target molecule for many diseases, including inflammatory diseases and cancer. The development of stable and disease-targeted delivery systems of CO is thus of interest and importance. Previously we developed a nano micellar CO donor SMA/CORM2 which shows superior bioavailability and therapeutic potential in many inflammatory disease models. We reported here, SMA/CORM2, through controlled release of CO, greatly ameliorated CsA-induced renal fibrosis via suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated TGF-β/Smad pathway. These findings suggest a new anti-inflammatory mechanism of CO, which also provides a new approach for controlling CsA-induced nephrotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Methylene-bridge tryptophan fatty acylation regulates PI3K-AKT signaling and glucose uptake</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35294873/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35294873/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The methylene-bridge-containing polyunsaturated fatty acids EPA and DHA modify proteins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tryptophan is a site of posttranslational modifications by polyunsaturated fatty acids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EPA and DHA activate AKT signaling by modifying PDK1 and AKT2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EPA and DHA promote glucose uptake but induce insulin resistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein fatty acylation regulates numerous cell signaling pathways. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) exert a plethora of physiological effects, including cell signaling regulation, with underlying mechanisms to be fully understood. Herein, we report that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) regulate PI3K-AKT signaling by modifying PDK1 and AKT2. DHA-administered mice exhibit altered phosphorylation of proteins in signaling pathways. Methylene bridge-containing DHA/EPA acylate δ1 carbon of tryptophan 448/543 in PDK1 and tryptophan 414 in AKT2 via free radical pathway, recruit both the proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane, and activate PI3K signaling and glucose uptake in a tryptophan acylation-dependent but insulin-independent manner in cultured cells and in mice. DHA/EPA deplete cytosolic PDK1 and AKT2 and induce insulin resistance. Akt2 knockout in mice abrogates DHA/EPA-induced PI3K-AKT signaling. Our results identify PUFA’s methylene bridge tryptophan acylation, a protein fatty acylation that regulates cell signaling and may underlie multifaceted effects of methylene-bridge-containing PUFAs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Airway secretory cell fate conversion via YAP-mTORC1-dependent essential amino acid metabolism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35285539/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue homeostasis requires lineage fidelity of stem cells. Dysregulation of cell fate specification and differentiation leads to various diseases, yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing these processes remain elusive. We demonstrate that YAP/TAZ activation reprograms airway secretory cells, which subsequently lose their cellular identity and acquire squamous alveolar type 1 (AT1) fate in the lung. This cell fate conversion is mediated via distinctive transitional cell states of damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs), recently shown to emerge during injury repair in mouse and human lungs. We further describe a YAP/TAZ signaling cascade to be integral for the fate conversion of secretory cells into AT1 fate, by modulating mTORC1/ATF4-mediated amino acid metabolism &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Importantly, we observed aberrant activation of the YAP/TAZ-mTORC1-ATF4 axis in the altered airway epithelium of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, including substantial emergence of DATPs and AT1 cells with severe pulmonary fibrosis. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of mTORC1 activity suppresses lineage alteration and subepithelial fibrosis driven by YAP/TAZ activation, proposing a potential therapeutic target for human fibrotic lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synopsis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The molecular programs underlying injury-induced plasticity in the lung epithelium remain unclear. Here, combined genetic and expression analysis uncovers YAP/TAZ as a driver of cell fate-converting metabolic signaling in the airways, offering new potential targets for human lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustained YAP/TAZ activation in airway secretory cells induces differentiation into squamous alveolar type 1 (AT1) fate, perturbed tissue architecture, and fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single-cell profiling shows transient cell states of damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs) during secretory-to-AT1 cell transition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YAP/TAZ-dependent uptake of essential amino acids via the Slc7a5/LAT1 is required for the acquisition of DATP-AT1 cell fates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mTORC1 and ATF4 mediate YAP/TAZ-dependent amino acid metabolism and cell fate conversion in ex vivo organoids and in vivo mouse lungs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients with pulmonary fibrosis show aberrant activation of YAP/TAZ and mTORC1-ATF4 signaling in the airways.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Fengreqing Oral Liquid Exerts Anti-Inflammatory Effects by Promoting Apoptosis and Inhibiting PI3K/AKT and NF-κB Signaling Pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35370749/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fengreqing oral liquid (FOL), a Chinese patent drug frequently used in clinical practice in China, is effective in treating inflammatory diseases of the upper respiratory tract such as colds and flu. However, its anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of FOL and its mechanisms on PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells were explored, as well as the regulatory effect of FOL on apoptosis. In addition, the potential of FOL for the treatment of acute lung injury was explored in LPS-induced ALI mice. The results showed that treatment with FOL significantly reduced the levels of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in the supernatant of LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, and also significantly reduced the phosphorylated protein levels of PI3K and AKT in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and also protein levels of NF-κB p50, phosphorylated NF-κB p65, and IκBα in the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, the results showed that FOL induced apoptosis in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells at the level of 80%-90%, and significantly increased the protein expression levels of the pro-apoptotic Bax and cleaved-caspase-3. In LPS-induced ALI mice, FOL administration showed inhibition of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and decreased protein expression levels of PI3K, AKT, NF-κB p50, and NF-κB p65, and elevated protein expression levels of Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 significantly. These results suggest that FOL may exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote apoptosis and leading to attenuated activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Injury-induced inflammatory signaling and hematopoiesis in Drosophila</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35286208/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explore mechanisms by which stress caused by acute injury affects blood cell development and inflammatory response in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;. Similar to their mammalian myeloid counterparts, these cells are predisposed to sense and react to sterile injury at distant sites. Upon sterile injury, a breach of epidermis sets up a reactive oxygen species-based signal that bypasses the pathogen-sensing apparatus of septic immune challenge, but merges downstream to activate Toll. A number of autonomous and nonautonomous signaling pathways follow in a sequence and are mapped temporally by the appearance of their corresponding molecular phenotypes. A cell-type that fights deposited parasitic wasp eggs appears with sterile injury without the immune challenge, perhaps in anticipation, because in nature injury is usually followed by infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory response in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; to sterile (axenic) injury in embryos and adults has received some attention in recent years, and most concentrate on the events at the injury site. Here we focus on the effect sterile injury has on the hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, and the circulating blood cells in the larva, the developmental stage at which major events of hematopoiesis are evident. In mammals, injury activates Toll-like receptor/NF-κB signaling in macrophages, which then express and secrete secondary, proinflammatory cytokines. In &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; larvae, distal puncture injury of the body wall epidermis causes a rapid activation of Toll and Jun kinase (JNK) signaling throughout the hematopoietic system and the differentiation of a unique blood cell type, the lamellocyte. Furthermore, we find that Toll and JNK signaling are coupled in their activation. Secondary to this Toll/JNK response, a cytokine, Upd3, is induced as a Toll pathway transcriptional target, which then promotes JAK/STAT signaling within the blood cells. Toll and JAK/STAT signaling are required for the emergence of the injury-induced lamellocytes. This is akin to the derivation of specialized macrophages in mammalian systems. Upstream, at the injury site, a Duox- and peroxide-dependent signal causes the activation of the proteases Grass and SPE, needed for the activation of the Toll-ligand Spz, but microbial sensors or the proteases most closely associated with them during septic injury are not involved in the axenic inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TRAF6 autophagic degradation by avibirnavirus VP3 inhibits antiviral innate immunity via blocking NFKB/NF-κB activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35266845/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitination is an important reversible post-translational modification. Many viruses hijack the host ubiquitin system to enhance self-replication. In the present study, we found that Avibirnavirus VP3 protein was ubiquitinated during infection and supported virus replication by ubiquitination. Mass spectrometry and mutation analysis showed that VP3 was ubiquitinated at residues K73, K135, K158, K193, and K219. Virus rescue showed that ubiquitination at sites K73, K193, and K219 on VP3 could enhance the replication abilities of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), and that K135 was essential for virus survival. Binding of the zinc finger domain of TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor 6) to VP3 mediated K11- and K33-linked ubiquitination of VP3, which promoted its nuclear accumulation to facilitate virus replication. Additionally, VP3 could inhibit TRAF6-mediated NFKB/NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) activation and IFNB/IFN-β (interferon beta) production to evade host innate immunity by inducing TRAF6 autophagic degradation in an SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1)-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrated a macroautophagic/autophagic mechanism by which Avibirnavirus protein VP3 blocked NFKB-mediated IFNB production by targeting TRAF6 during virus infection, and provided a potential drug target for virus infection control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TIGAR drives colorectal cancer ferroptosis resistance through ROS/AMPK/SCD1 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35271998/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy and major cause of cancer death in the world. Ferroptosis is a recently identified type of regulated cell death. Increasing evidence has shown that ferroptosis plays an important regulatory role in the occurrence and development of cancer. This study identified TIGAR as a potential regulator of ferroptosis resistance in the development of CRC. We showed that TIGAR expression in CRC tissues is significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues. Knockdown of TIGAR significantly caused an increase in erastin-induced ferroptosis in SW620 and HCT116 cells. Notably, knockdown of TIGAR significantly decreased GSH/GSSG ratio, increased lipid peroxidation production, and facilitated the accumulation of lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA), and rendered CRC cells more sensitive to erastin induced ferroptosis. Furthermore, TIGAR inhibition repressed SCD1 expression in a redox and AMPK-dependent manner. Thus, these results suggest that TIGAR induces ferroptosis resistance in CRC cells via the ROS/AMPK/SCD1 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Molecular Mechanism of Long Non-Coding RNA (LncRNA) Regulation of Notch Signaling in Glucose-Induced Apoptosis of Human Retinal Vascular Endothelial Cell</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35715905/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetes, a global health concern, affects the health of more than 500 million adults. The absence of Notch protein can cause an imbalance in the retinal vascular environment and cause retinal vascular disease. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is known to be involved in the regulation of many signaling pathways. We hope to understand the specific mechanism of apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells (RVECs) by exploring the regulatory effect of lncRNA on the Notch pathway. In this study, we found that RVECs treated with glucose showed increased levels of Notch transcript and protein expression. The lentiviral interference with Notch RNAi reversed this response. When Notch activity decreased, oxidative stress also decreased, accompanied by increased levels of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 and an increased rate of apoptosis. Therefore, we believe that Notch is involved in the development of diabetic retinopathy and loss of expression promotes apoptosis of human RVECs. By inhibiting the Notch pathway, lncRNA promotes apoptosis of human RVECs in a high-glucose environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amelioration of Endotoxin-Induced Acute Lung Injury and Alveolar Epithelial Cells Apoptosis by Simvastatin Is Associated with Up-Regulation of Survivin/NF-kB/p65 Pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disruption of the alveolar-endothelial barrier caused by inflammation leads to the progression of septic acute lung injury (ALI). In the present study, we investigated the beneficial effects of simvastatin on the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and its related mechanisms. A model of ALI was induced within experimental sepsis developed by intraperitoneal injection of a single non-lethal LPS dose after short-term simvastatin pretreatment (10-40 mg/kg orally). The severity of the lung tissue inflammatory injury was expressed as pulmonary damage scores (PDS). Alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL assay (DNA fragmentation) and expressed as an apoptotic index (AI), and immunohistochemically for cleaved caspase-3, cytochrome C, and anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, an inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin, and transcriptional factor, NF-kB/p65. Severe inflammatory injury of pulmonary parenchyma (PDS 3.33 ± 0.48) was developed after the LPS challenge, whereas simvastatin significantly and dose-dependently protected lung histology after LPS (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Simvastatin in a dose of 40 mg/kg showed the most significant effects in amelioration alveolar epithelial cells apoptosis, demonstrating this as a marked decrease of AI (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01 vs. LPS), cytochrome C, and cleaved caspase-3 expression. Furthermore, simvastatin significantly enhanced the expression of Bcl-xL and survivin. Finally, the expression of survivin and its regulator NF-kB/p65 in the alveolar epithelium was in strong positive correlation across the groups. Simvastatin could play a protective role against LPS-induced ALI and apoptosis of the alveolar-endothelial barrier. Taken together, these effects were seemingly mediated by inhibition of caspase 3 and cytochrome C, a finding that might be associated with the up-regulation of cell-survival survivin/NF-kB/p65 pathway and Bcl-xL.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Piperazine ferulate attenuates gentamicin-induced acute kidney injury via the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35286937/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Piperazine ferulate (PF) is widely used in chronic nephritis and nephrotic syndrome in clinic. PF can improve diseases related inflammation by inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signal. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is usually associated with the occurrence and development of renal inflammation. However, the nephroprotective effect and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of PF on AKI are not clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to investigate the nephroprotective effects of PF on gentamicin (GM) induced AKI in rats and its potential mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were intraperitoneally injected with GM (100 mg/kg/day) with or without PF (50 and 100 mg/kg/day) for 7 consecutive days. In vitro, the NRK-52e cells were exposed to GM (7 mg/ml) with or without PF (62.5 μg/ml) treatment. The renal injury and cell damage were assessed subsequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings showed that PF treatment can significantly improve renal function, reduce renal pathological changes, and attenuate inflammatory response in rats treated with gentamicin. Besides, PF could significantly reduce the cell damage and cellular inflammatory response. In terms of mechanisms, our study revealed that PF can evidently inhibit the activation of NF-κB and nod-like receptor family pyrin domain protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Meanwhile, it could down regulate the expressions of protein and gene of p-IKKα, p-IKKβ, p-p65, p65, p50, p105, NLRP3 and IL-1β.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings showed that PF may improve inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway, so as to attenuate AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chicoric Acid Attenuated Renal Tubular Injury in HFD-Induced Chronic Kidney Disease Mice through the Promotion of Mitophagy via the Nrf2/PINK/Parkin Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35195395/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the main factor in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the excessive apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) and its underlying mechanism of action are worth further investigation. Chicoric acid (CA), a major active constituent of the Uyghur folk medicine chicory, was recorded to possess a renal protective effect. The precise effect of CA on renal tubular injury in obesity-related CKD remains unknown. In the current study, CA was proven to ameliorate metabolic disorders including overweight, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemia in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Furthermore, the reverse effect of CA on renal histological changes and functional damage was confirmed. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, the alleviation of lipid accumulation and cell apoptosis was observed in palmitic acid (PA)-exposed HK2 cells. Treatment with CA reduced mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress in the renal tubule of HFD-fed mice and PA-treated HK2 cells. Finally, CA was observed to activate the Nrf2 pathway; increase PINK and Parkin expression; and regulate LC3, SQSTM1, Mfn2, and FIS1 expression; therefore, it would improve mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy to alleviate mitochondrial damage in RTECs of obesity-related CKD. These results may provide fresh insights into the promotion of mitophagy in the prevention and alleviation of obesity-related CKD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Low-dose metformin targets the lysosomal AMPK pathway through PEN2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35197629/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metformin, the most prescribed antidiabetic medicine, has shown other benefits such as anti-ageing and anticancer effects. For clinical doses of metformin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a major role in its mechanism of action; however, the direct molecular target of metformin remains unknown. Here we show that clinically relevant concentrations of metformin inhibit the lysosomal proton pump v-ATPase, which is a central node for AMPK activation following glucose starvation. We synthesize a photoactive metformin probe and identify PEN2, a subunit of γ-secretase, as a binding partner of metformin with a dissociation constant at micromolar levels. Metformin-bound PEN2 forms a complex with ATP6AP1, a subunit of the v-ATPase, which leads to the inhibition of v-ATPase and the activation of AMPK without effects on cellular AMP levels. Knockout of PEN2 or re-introduction of a PEN2 mutant that does not bind ATP6AP1 blunts AMPK activation. In vivo, liver-specific knockout of Pen2 abolishes metformin-mediated reduction of hepatic fat content, whereas intestine-specific knockout of Pen2 impairs its glucose-lowering effects. Furthermore, knockdown of pen-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans abrogates metformin-induced extension of lifespan. Together, these findings reveal that metformin binds PEN2 and initiates a signalling route that intersects, through ATP6AP1, the lysosomal glucose-sensing pathway for AMPK activation. This ensures that metformin exerts its therapeutic benefits in patients without substantial adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein-4 promotes renal inflammatory injury in type 2 diabetes mellitus</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35218794/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35218794/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein-4 (RasGRP4) is an activator of Ras protein, which plays significant roles in both the inflammatory response and immune activation. This study determined the role of RasGRP4 in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to establish RasGRP4 knockout (KO) mice. Diabetes was induced by a high-fat diet combined with five consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) in C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice and RasGRP4 KO mice. Hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson&amp;rsquo;s trichrome staining were used to observe the histology of pathological injury. Immunohistochemical staining was used to analyze inflammatory cell infiltration. Quantitative PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of inflammatory mediators and the activation of signaling pathways in renal tissues. In vitro cell co-culture experiments were performed to explore the interactions between peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; RasGRP4 KO mice developed less severe diabetic kidney injury compared to WT mice, exhibiting lower proteinuria, reduced CD3+ T lymphocyte and F4/80+ macrophage infiltration, less inflammatory mediator expression including interleukin 6, tumor necrosis alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and lower expression levels of critical signal transduction molecules in the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 inflammasome and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways in the diabetic kidney. In vitro experiments showed that the adhesion function of PBMCs of RasGRP4 KO mice was reduced compared to that of WT mice. Moreover, the expression of adhesion molecules and critical signal transduction molecules in the NLRP3 inflammasome and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways in GEnCs was stimulated by the supernatant of PBMCs, which were derived from RasGRP4 KO mice treated with high glucose and were also significantly reduced compared to those derived from WT mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; RasGRP4 promotes the inflammatory injury mediated by PBMCs in diabetes, probably by regulating the interaction between PBMCs and GEnCs and further activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Buformin alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis through an AMPK-dependent pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35132999/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated macrophage pyroptosis plays an important role in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Inhibition of pyroptosis may be a way to alleviate inflammation as well as tissue damage triggered after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The aim of the present study was to explore whether buformin (BF), a hypoglycemic agent, could alleviate sepsis-induced ALI by inhibiting pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Wildtype C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into control group, BF group, LPS group and LPS+BF group. BF group and LPS+BF group were pretreated with BF at a dose of 25 mg/kg, and the changes were observed. In addition, BF was used to interfere with THP-1 cells. The therapeutic effect of BF has been verified by intraperitoneal injection of BF in vivo after LPS stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation and injury was significantly reduced in BF pretreated mice, and the indexes related to pyroptosis were suppressed. The phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in lung tissues of mice in the BF and LPS+BF groups was significantly higher. In THP-1 cells, the AMPK inhibitor, Compound C was added to demonstrate that BF worked via AMPK to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome. It was further demonstrated that BF up-regulated autophagy, which in turn promoted NLRP3 inflammasome degradation. On the other hand, BF decreased NLRP3 mRNA level by increasing nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). And BF showed a therapeutic effect after LPS challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study confirmed that BF inhibited NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in sepsis-induced ALI by up-regulating autophagy and Nrf2 protein level through an AMPK-dependent pathway. This provides a new strategy for clinical mitigation of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pseudohypoxic HIF pathway activation dysregulates collagen structure-function in human lung fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35188460/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening with downstream activation of mechanosensitive pathways is strongly implicated in fibrosis. We previously reported that altered collagen nanoarchitecture is a key determinant of pathogenetic ECM structure-function in human fibrosis (Jones et al., 2018). Here, through human tissue, bioinformatic and ex vivo studies we provide evidence that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway activation is a critical pathway for this process regardless of the oxygen status (pseudohypoxia). Whilst TGFβ increased the rate of fibrillar collagen synthesis, HIF pathway activation was required to dysregulate post-translational modification of fibrillar collagen, promoting pyridinoline cross-linking, altering collagen nanostructure, and increasing tissue stiffness. In vitro, knockdown of Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH), which modulates HIF activity, or oxidative stress caused pseudohypoxic HIF activation in the normal fibroblasts. By contrast, endogenous FIH activity was reduced in fibroblasts from patients with lung fibrosis in association with significantly increased normoxic HIF pathway activation. In human lung fibrosis tissue, HIF-mediated signalling was increased at sites of active fibrogenesis whilst subpopulations of human lung fibrosis mesenchymal cells had increases in both HIF and oxidative stress scores. Our data demonstrate that oxidative stress can drive pseudohypoxic HIF pathway activation which is a critical regulator of pathogenetic collagen structure-function in fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Puerarin-V prevents the progression of hypoxia- and monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in rodent models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35190697/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a cardiopulmonary disease characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. One of the initial pathogenic factors of PH is pulmonary arterial remodeling under various stimuli. Current marketed drugs against PH mainly relieve symptoms without significant improvement in overall prognosis. Discovering and developing new therapeutic drugs that interfere with vascular remodeling is in urgent need. Puerarin is an isoflavone compound extracted from the root of Kudzu vine, which is widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of puerarin in the treatment of experimental PH. PH was induced in rats by a single injection of MCT (50 mg/kg, sc), and in mice by exposure to hypoxia (10% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 14 days. After MCT injection the rats were administered puerarin (10, 30, 100 mg·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;·d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.g.) for 28 days, whereas hypoxia-treated mice were pre-administered puerarin (60 mg·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;·d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.g.) for 7 days. We showed that puerarin administration exerted significant protective effects in both experimental PH rodent models, evidenced by significantly reduced right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and lung injury, improved pulmonary artery blood flow as well as pulmonary vasodilation and contraction function, inhibited inflammatory responses in lung tissues, improved resistance to apoptosis and abnormal proliferation in lung tissues, attenuated right ventricular injury and remodeling, and maintained normal function of the right ventricle. We revealed that MCT and hypoxia treatment significantly downregulated BMPR2/Smad signaling in the lung tissues and PPARγ/PI3K/Akt signaling in the lung tissues and right ventricles, which were restored by puerarin administration. In addition, we showed that a novel crystal type V (Puer-V) exerted better therapeutic effects than the crude form of puerarin (Puer). Furthermore, Puer-V was more efficient than bosentan (a positive control drug) in alleviating the abnormal structural changes and dysfunction of lung tissues and right ventricles. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence for developing Puer-V as a novel therapeutic drug to treat PH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation exposure to lungs during nuclear catastrophes or radiotherapy poses long-term side effects and can induce pulmonary injury sufficient for causing death. The strategies for preventing or reversing radiation-induced lung injuries have not been yet developed. Quercetin-3-Rutinoside (Q-3-R), a polyphenolic bioflavonoid, has shown multifaceted pharmacological applications due to its high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; In the current study, the potential of Q-3-R against radiation-induced lung pneumonitis/fibrosis and the possible underlying mechanism was investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study design: To evaluate the effect of Q-3-R against lung damage, C57Bl/6 mice were administered with Q-3-R (10 mg/kg b.wt.) and irradiated with a single dose of gamma radiation (12 Gy) at thoracic region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; 16 weeks after irradiation lung damage was seen by histopathological studies and staining for collagen deposition. Expression of Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Smad3, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), α-smooth muscle actin protein (α-SMA), Aquaporin 5 (AQP 5), Interleukins (IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and caspase-3 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry/western blot/Elisa. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)/ Nitric oxide (NO) scavenging potential of Q-3-R and inhibition of cell death in irradiated lungs were also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Mice showed signs of pneumonitis and fibrotic changes in lungs following radiation treatment. A dramatic increase in inflammatory cells and cytokines contributing to lung disease pathogenesis was observed. Furthermore, expression of NF-κB, TGF-β1, Smad3, ICAM-1, AQP5and α-SMA was found markedly up-regulated. However, pretreatment of Q-3-R significantly attenuated radiation-induced pneumonitis and fibrosis. Histological examination revealed less structural and fibrotic changes with down-regulation of AQP 5, ICAM-1, α-SMA and caspase-3 in Q-3-R pretreated irradiated groups. The formulation significantly relieved lung injury by suppressing inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines such as IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β1 via inhibition of NF-κB. Q-3-R also curtailed radiation-induced ROS/NO generation and minimized DNA damage in the irradiated lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The findings from the current study clearly demonstrate that Q-3-R provides radioprotection to the lungs by regulating NF-κB/TGF-β1 signaling, scavenging free radicals, preventing perivascular infiltration and prolonged inflammatory cascade which could otherwise lead to chronic radiation fibrosis. Q-3-R can be proved as a potential therapeutic agent for alleviating radiation-induced lung injury in case of planned or unplanned radiation exposure scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in fine particulate matter-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35182631/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution poses significant health concerns worldwide and can cause respiratory diseases. However, how it causes health problems is still poorly understood. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 is a terminal carboxypeptidase implicated in the functions of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and plays a crucial role in the control of lung inflammation. To investigate whether ACE2 functions in PM2.5-induced lung inflammation, wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice and ACE2 knock-out (KO) mice were intratracheally instilled with PBS or PM2.5 suspension for 3 consecutive days, respectively. The concentrations of cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined by ELISA. The expression of ACE2 and ACE and activation of inflammatory signaling pathways in lung tissues were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting. We found that PM2.5 exposure increased ACE2 expression. Loss of ACE2 significantly elevated the levels of total proteins, total cells, and the concentrations of MCP-1, IL-1β in BALF after PM2.5 challenge. Additionally, loss of ACE2 enhanced lung pathologies, airway resistance, and inflammatory signaling activation. Collectively, loss of ACE2 exacerbates PM2.5-induced acute lung injury in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of MAT2A-ACSL3 pathway protects cells from ferroptosis in gastric cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35182729/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferroptosis, a new form of programmed cell death caused by overwhelming lipid peroxidation, has gained a lot of interest in the field of cancer therapeutics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, few studies have thoroughly investigated the association between methionine metabolism and ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MAT2A mediates the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which upregulates ACSL3 by increasing the trimethylation of lysine-4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) at the promoter area, resulting in ferroptosis resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ferroptosis, a unique form of nonapoptotic-regulated cell death caused by overwhelming lipid peroxidation, represents an emerging tumor suppression mechanism. Growing evidence has demonstrated that cell metabolism plays an important role in the regulation of ferroptosis. Specifically, the association between methionine metabolism and ferroptosis remains undefined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the influence of methionine metabolism on ferroptosis sensitivity. Pharmacological and genetic blockade of the methionine cycle was utilized and relevant molecular analyses were performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We identified MAT2A as a driver of ferroptosis resistance. Mechanistically, MAT2A mediates the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which upregulates ACSL3 by increasing the trimethylation of lysine-4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) at the promoter area, resulting in ferroptosis resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, these results established a link between methionine cycle activity and ferroptosis vulnerability in gastric cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nicotinamide breaks effector CD8 T cell responses by targeting mTOR signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35243268/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAM increases glycolysis while reducing effector cytokine production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAM inhibits mTORC1 activation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In T cells NAM induces the expression of memory markers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAM diet supplementation modulates T cell effector potential &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicotinamide (NAM) shapes T cell responses but its precise molecular mechanism of action remains elusive. Here, we show that NAM impairs naive T cell effector transition but also effector T cells themselves. Although aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of activated T cells, CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells exposed to NAM displayed enhanced glycolysis, yet producing significantly less IFNγ. Mechanistically, NAM reduced mTORC1 activity independently of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; metabolism, decreasing IFNγ translation and regulating T cell transcriptional factors critical to effector/memory fate. Finally, the role of NAM in a biomedically relevant model of lung injury was tested. Specifically, a NAM-supplemented diet reduced systemic IL-2, antigen-specific T cell clonal expansion, and effector function after inhalation of &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; enterotoxin A. These findings identify NAM as a potential therapeutic supplement that uncouples glycolysis from effector cytokine production and may be a powerful treatment for diseases associated with T cell hyperactivation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcriptional analysis of lung fibroblasts identifies PIM1 signaling as a driver of aging-associated persistent fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35167499/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an aging-associated disease characterized by myofibroblast accumulation and progressive lung scarring. To identify transcriptional gene programs driving persistent lung fibrosis in aging, we performed RNA-Seq on lung fibroblasts isolated from young and aged mice during the early resolution phase after bleomycin injury. We discovered that, relative to injured young fibroblasts, injured aged fibroblasts exhibited a profibrotic state characterized by elevated expression of genes implicated in inflammation, matrix remodeling, and cell survival. We identified the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) and its target nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFATc1) as putative drivers of the sustained profibrotic gene signatures in injured aged fibroblasts. PIM1 and NFATc1 transcripts were enriched in a pathogenic fibroblast population recently discovered in IPF lungs, and their protein expression was abundant in fibroblastic foci. Overexpression of PIM1 in normal human lung fibroblasts potentiated their fibrogenic activation, and this effect was attenuated by NFATc1 inhibition. Pharmacological inhibition of PIM1 attenuated IPF fibroblast activation and sensitized them to apoptotic stimuli. Interruption of PIM1 signaling in IPF lung explants ex vivo inhibited prosurvival gene expression and collagen secretion, suggesting that targeting this pathway may represent a therapeutic strategy to block IPF progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long noncoding RNA Gm31629 protects against mucosal damage in experimental colitis via YB-1/E2F pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35143419/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mucosal healing is a key treatment goal for inflammatory bowel disease, and adequate epithelial regeneration is required for an intact gut epithelium. However, the underlying mechanism for mucosal healing is unclear. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be involved in the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we report that a lncRNA named Gm31629 decreased in intestinal epithelial cells in response to inflammatory stimulation. Gm31629 deficiency led to exacerbated intestinal inflammation and delayed epithelial regeneration in dextran sulfate sodium-induced (DSS-induced) colitis model. Mechanistically, Gm31629 promoted E2F pathways and cell proliferation by stabilizing Y-box protein 1 (YB-1), thus facilitating epithelial regeneration. Genetic overexpression of Gm31629 protected against DSS-induced colitis in vivo. Theaflavin 3-gallate, a natural compound mimicking Gm31629, alleviated DSS-induced epithelial inflammation and mucosal damage. These results demonstrate an essential role of lncRNA Gm31629 in linking intestinal inflammation and epithelial cell proliferation, providing a potential therapeutic approach to inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ruxolitinib attenuates secondary injury after traumatic spinal cord injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation post-traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) induces microglial activation, which leads to prolonged neurological dysfunction. However, the mechanism underlying microglial activation-induced neuroinflammation remains poorly understood. Ruxolitinib (RUX), a selective inhibitor of JAK1/2, was recently reported to inhibit inflammatory storms caused by SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. However, its role in disrupting inflammation post-SCI has not been confirmed. In this study, microglia were treated with RUX for 24 hours and then activated with interferon-γ for 6 hours. The results showed that interferon-γ-induced phosphorylation of JAK and STAT in microglia was inhibited, and the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and cell proliferation marker Ki67 were reduced. In further in vivo experiments, a mouse model of spinal cord injury was treated intragastrically with RUX for 3 successive days, and the findings suggest that RUX can inhibit microglial proliferation by inhibiting the interferon-γ/JAK/STAT pathway. Moreover, microglia treated with RUX centripetally migrated toward injured foci, remaining limited and compacted within the glial scar, which resulted in axon preservation and less demyelination. Moreover, the protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 were reduced. The neuromotor function of SCI mice also recovered. These findings suggest that RUX can inhibit neuroinflammation through inhibiting the interferon-γ/JAK/STAT pathway, thereby reducing secondary injury after SCI and producing neuroprotective effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phosphatase activity of endothelial Shp2 is elevated by irradiation &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radiation-induced Jag1 is blocked in Shp2-deficient endothelium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of Shp2 in endothelium relieves radiation-induced pulmonary injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shp2-deficient endothelium restrains macrophage activation via Notch signaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury is a common late side effect of thoracic radiotherapy. Endothelial dysfunction following leukocytes infiltration is a prominent feature in this process. Here, we established a clinical-mimicking mouse model of radiation-induced lung injury and found the activity of phosphatase Shp2 was elevated in endothelium after injury. Endothelium-specific Shp2 deletion mice showed relieved collagen deposition along with disrupted radiation-induced Jag1 expression in the endothelium. Furthermore, endothelium-derived Jag1 activated the alternative activation of macrophages &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; by paracrine Notch signaling. Consistently, the Notch pathway was significantly activated by chest irradiation in the peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with cancer. Collectively, our work demonstrates that Shp2 participates in the radiation-induced endothelial dysfunction and subsequently inflammatory microenvironment producing during radiation-induced lung injury. Our findings indicate Shp2 as a potential target for radiation-induced lung injury and provide another way for endothelium to participate in the pathological process of radiation-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dihydroartemisinin attenuates pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in rats by suppressing JAK2/STAT3 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35120332/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has induced a worldwide pandemic since early 2020. COVID-19 causes pulmonary inflammation, secondary pulmonary fibrosis (PF); however, there are still no effective treatments for PF. The present study aimed to explore the inhibitory effect of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) on pulmonary inflammation and PF, and its molecular mechanism. Morphological changes and collagen deposition were analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson staining, and the hydroxyproline content. DHA attenuated early alveolar inflammation and later PF in a bleomycin-induced rat PF model, and inhibited the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 3 (CCL3) in model rat serum. Further molecular analysis revealed that both pulmonary inflammation and PF were associated with increased transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2), and signal transducer and activator 3(STAT3) expression in the lung tissues of model rats. DHA reduced the inflammatory response and PF in the lungs by suppressing TGF-β1, JAK2, phosphorylated (p)-JAK2, STAT3, and p-STAT3. Thus, DHA exerts therapeutic effects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and PF by inhibiting JAK2-STAT3 activation. DHA inhibits alveolar inflammation, and attenuates lung injury and fibrosis, possibly representing a therapeutic candidate to treat PF associated with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effect of α-tocopherol in alleviating the lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35112986/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leads to the acute lung injury (ALI), a form of diffused alveolars injury, accompanied by severe inflammation and oxidative damage of alveolar epithelial cells. α-Tocopherol (α-TOH), one of the eight isoforms of vitamin E, is a natural antioxidant-free radical. We aimed to understand the effect of α-TOH and mechanism involved in inducing the ALI. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is injected into the trachea of mice to generate ALI mouse models. α-TOH was used to administrate the mice intragastrically to detect the expression of inflammatory factors and antioxidant molecules by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining. Mouse alveolar epithelial cell line (MLE-12 cells) was used to determine the effect of α-TOH on alveolar epithelial cells. Inflammatory factors such as, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α shows significant increase in the lung tissues of the mice induced by LPS and reduction in the expressions of superoxide dismutase (SOD)1/2 and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). After treatment with α-TOH, the inflammation and oxidative stress levels shows substantial reduction in the lung tissues of the mice. Moreover, α-TOH also increases the proliferation ability of MLE-12 cells in vitro and reduces apoptosis level. In addition, α-TOH reduces p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in alveolar epithelial cells &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, thus, inhibiting the activity of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. α-TOH reduces the inflammation and oxidative stress of lung tissue by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby alleviating the LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanocurcumin Potently Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Induced Cytokine Storm by Deactivation of MAPK/NF-κB Signaling in Epithelial Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35112841/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interleukin-mediated deep cytokine storm, an aggressive inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in COVID-19 patients, is correlated directly with lung injury, multi-organ failure, and poor prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients. Curcumin (CUR), a phenolic antioxidant compound obtained from turmeric (&lt;em&gt;Curcuma longa L.&lt;/em&gt;), is well-known for its strong anti-inflammatory activity. However, its &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; efficacy is constrained due to poor bioavailability. Herein, we report that CUR-encapsulated polysaccharide nanoparticles (CUR-PS-NPs) potently inhibit the release of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors associated with damage of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (CoV2-SP)-stimulated liver Huh7.5 and lung A549 epithelial cells. Treatment with CUR-PS-NPs effectively attenuated the interaction of ACE2 and CoV2-SP. The effects of CUR-PS-NPs were linked to reduced NF-κB/MAPK signaling which in turn decreased CoV2-SP-mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK, and p65/NF-κB as well as nuclear p65/NF-κB expression. The findings of the study strongly indicate that organic NPs of CUR can be used to control hyper-inflammatory responses and prevent lung and liver injuries associated with CoV2-SP-mediated cytokine storm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CBASS phage defense and evolution of antiviral nucleotide signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35123147/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling system (CBASS) immunity is a widespread form of antiphage defense in bacteria and archaea. Each CBASS operon encodes a cGAS/DncV-like Nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) enzyme that synthesizes a nucleotide second messenger in response to viral infection. An associated Cap effector protein then binds the nucleotide signal and executes cell death to destroy the host cell and block phage propagation. Here we build upon recent advances to establish rules controlling each step of CBASS activation and antiphage defense. Comparative analysis of CBASS, CRISPR, Pycsar, and cGAS-STING immunity provides insight into the evolution of phage defense and animal innate immunity and highlights new questions emerging in the role of nucleotide second messenger signaling in host-virus interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;TRAF2 is a positive regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in colon cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidambaric acid (LDA) inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling via targeting TRAF2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A TRAF2/β-catenin/TCF4/TNIK complex is present in colon cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDA disrupts the TRAF2/β-catenin/TCF4 complex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a well-established driver of colon cancer; however, a targeted therapeutic agent has not reached clinics yet. In the present study, we report that the natural compound liquidambaric acid (LDA) inhibits oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo through its direct target tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). Mechanistically, TRAF2 positively regulates Wnt signaling by interacting with the N-terminal of β-catenin via its TRAF-C domain; this interaction is disrupted in presence of LDA. Particularly, a TRAF2/β-catenin/TCF4/TNIK complex is present in colon cancer cells, where TRAF2 is indispensable for the complex formation, and TRAF2/β-catenin and β-catenin/TCF4 interactions are disrupted upon LDA treatment. Our findings not only highlight that TRAF2 is an oncogenic regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and colon cancer but also provide a lead compound targeting TRAF2 for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The volume-regulated anion channel LRRC8C suppresses T cell function by regulating cyclic dinucleotide transport and STING-p53 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35105987/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35105987/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is formed by LRRC8 proteins and is responsible for the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) after hypotonic cell swelling. Besides chloride, VRAC transports other molecules, for example, immunomodulatory cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) including 2&#39;3&amp;rsquo;cGAMP. Here, we identify LRRC8C as a critical component of VRAC in T cells, where its deletion abolishes VRAC currents and RVD. T cells of &lt;em&gt;Lrrc8c&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice have increased cell cycle progression, proliferation, survival, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and cytokine production-a phenotype associated with downmodulation of p53 signaling. Mechanistically, LRRC8C mediates the transport of 2&#39;3&amp;rsquo;cGAMP in T cells, resulting in STING and p53 activation. Inhibition of STING recapitulates the phenotype of LRRC8C-deficient T cells, whereas overexpression of p53 inhibits their enhanced T cell function. &lt;em&gt;Lrrc8c&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice have exacerbated T cell-dependent immune responses, including immunity to influenza A virus infection and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our results identify cGAMP uptake through LRRC8C and STING-p53 signaling as a new inhibitory signaling pathway in T cells and adaptive immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DL0805-1, a novel Rho-kinase inhibitor, attenuates lung injury and vasculopathy in a rat model of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35092757/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a severe chronic cardiopulmonary dysfunction characterized by impaired of pulmonary circulation. Current therapeutic drugs mainly act as vasodilators, leading to an unsatisfactory prognosis. The Rho/ROCK pathway plays an important role in the cardiovascular system. DL0805-1, a novel Rho kinase inhibitor, synthesized by our institute and showed a protective effect on lung tissues and reduced right ventricular systolic pressure in a hypertensive crisis rat model in our previous study. The present study aims to explore the efficacy of DL0805-1 on PH. The classical PH rat model induced by a single subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline was used to investigate the therapeutic effect of DL0805-1 on PH and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that the high dose of DL0805-1 had a better effect on the survival rate and controlled right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) of PH rats than fasudil. DL0805-1 also exhibited a superior lung protective effect and significantly improved pulmonary vascular function compared with bosentan. Regarding molecular mechanisms, DL0805-1 inhibited the ROCK pathway in both pulmonary arteries and lung tissues. Taken together, DL0805-1 alleviated lung injury and vasculopathy in experimental PH rats. DL0805-1 has the potential to be developed as a candidate drug for the treatment of PH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel nordihydroguaiaretic acid analog, compound 3a, alleviates acute lung injury by exerting antiapoptotic and antiinflammatory effects</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35085517/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a continuum of pulmonary changes caused by various lung insults. Previously, we synthesized a series of nordihydroguaiaretic acid analogs; of these, compound 3a exhibited excellent antioxidant capacity in a murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. However, it remains unclear whether compound 3a can modulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. ALI was induced via tracheal LPS administration, and the pathological changes were assessed. The level of inflammation was verified by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses. Apoptosis was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assays and Western blotting. Changes in the levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway proteins were assessed by immunofluorescence assays and Western blotting. In vitro, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with compound 3a prior to LPS challenge, and the intracellular level of inflammation was assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Relevant proteins were detected via immunofluorescence assays and Western blotting. Mice developed extensive lung inflammation by 24 h after LPS challenge. Histological examination revealed signs typical of ALI. Preadministration of compound 3a markedly ameliorated the histopathological changes and reduced fluid exudation into the alveolar space. Compound 3a also greatly reduced the levels of inflammation and apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, compound 3a markedly reduced phosphorylation of MAPK/NF-κB pathway-related proteins and p65 translocation, consistent with the in vitro observations. In summary, administration of compound 3a prior to LPS suppressed ALI via inhibition of the MAPK/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MGF360-9L Is a Major Virulence Factor Associated with the African Swine Fever Virus by Antagonizing the JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35076286/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African swine fever (ASF)-an aggressive infectious disease caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV)-is significantly unfavorable for swine production. ASFV has a complex structure and encodes 150-167 proteins; however, the function of most of these proteins is unknown. This study identified ASFV MGF360-9L as a negative regulator of the interferon (IFN)-β signal. Further evidence showed that MGF360-9L interacts with signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2 and degrades STAT1 and STAT2 through apoptosis and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways, respectively. Subsequently, the activation of IFN-β signaling was inhibited. Naturally isolated or genetically manipulated live attenuated viruses are known to protect against the virulent parental ASFV strains. Therefore, through homologous recombination, we deleted MGF360-9L from the virulent ASFV CN/GS/2018 strain to construct a recombinant strain, ASFV-Δ360-9L. Compared with the parent ASFV CN/GS/2018 strain, the replication level of ASFV-Δ360-9L decreased in primary porcine alveolar macrophage cultures at 24 h postinfection, but the difference is unlikely to be biologically relevant. Notably, ASFV-Δ360-9L was partially attenuated in pigs. To our knowledge, this study is the first to uncover the function of MGF360-9L during ASFV infection. MGF360-9L inhibits IFN-β signaling through the targeted degradation of STAT1 and STAT2. Furthermore, MGF360-9L is a key virulence gene of ASFV. Our findings reveal a new mechanism by which ASFV inhibits host antiviral response; this might facilitate the development of live attenuated ASFV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African swine fever-an acute, febrile, hemorrhagic, highly contacting, and highly lethal disease caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV)-jeopardizes the global pig industry. Understanding the mechanism ASFV employs to evade host defense during infection is essential for developing targeted drugs and vaccines against ASFV. To our knowledge, this study identifies the mechanism of innate immunity against by MGF360-9L and the effect of MGF360-9L on ASFV pathogenicity. The results showed that MGF360-9L may help ASFV escape the host immunity by degrading STAT1 and STAT2 and thus inhibiting IFN-β signaling. MGF360-9L is also an important virulence factor of ASFV. The deletion of MGF360-9L reduces ASFV virulence in pigs. This study explored a new mechanism of ASFV against innate immunity and identified a new ASFV virulence factor; these findings may guide the development of live attenuated ASFV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of Klotho, an anti-aging protein, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney diseases. As Klotho is a large transmembrane protein, it is challenging to harness it as a therapeutic remedy. Here we report the discovery of a Klotho-derived peptide 1 (KP1) protecting kidneys by targeting TGF-β signaling. By screening a series of peptides derived from human Klotho protein, we identified KP1 that repressed fibroblast activation by binding to TGF-β receptor 2 (TβR2) and disrupting the TGF-β/TβR2 engagement. As such, KP1 blocked TGF-β-induced activation of Smad2/3 and mitogen-activated protein kinases. In mouse models of renal fibrosis, intravenous injection of KP1 resulted in its preferential accumulation in injured kidneys. KP1 preserved kidney function, repressed TGF-β signaling, ameliorated renal fibrosis and restored endogenous Klotho expression. Together, our findings suggest that KP1 recapitulates the anti-fibrotic action of Klotho and offers a potential remedy in the fight against fibrotic kidney diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The cGAS-STING pathway drives type I IFN immunopathology in COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35045565/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19, which is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, is characterized by lung pathology and extrapulmonary complications. Type I interferons (IFNs) have an essential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Although rapid induction of type I IFNs limits virus propagation, a sustained increase in the levels of type I IFNs in the late phase of the infection is associated with aberrant inflammation and poor clinical outcome. Here we show that the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, which controls immunity to cytosolic DNA, is a critical driver of aberrant type I IFN responses in COVID-19. Profiling COVID-19 skin manifestations, we uncover a STING-dependent type I IFN signature that is primarily mediated by macrophages adjacent to areas of endothelial cell damage. Moreover, cGAS-STING activity was detected in lung samples from patients with COVID-19 with prominent tissue destruction, and was associated with type I IFN responses. A lung-on-chip model revealed that, in addition to macrophages, infection with SARS-CoV-2 activates cGAS-STING signalling in endothelial cells through mitochondrial DNA release, which leads to cell death and type I IFN production. In mice, pharmacological inhibition of STING reduces severe lung inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 and improves disease outcome. Collectively, our study establishes a mechanistic basis of pathological type I IFN responses in COVID-19 and reveals a principle for the development of host-directed therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discovery of the first sense promoter-associated ncRNA derived from GLI1 (paGLI1), which is overexpressed in diffusely infiltrating gliomas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PaGLI1 promotes GLI1 gene transcription by interacting with paGLI1 DNA, binding to and recruitment of transcription factor complex FUS/P65 to the GLI1 promoter, which results in enhancement of glioma cell proliferation and invasiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over-expression of paGLI1 is a significant unfavorable prognosticator for both disease-specific and progression-free survival in glioma patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) is a core component of the Hedgehog (HH) signalling pathway and is a transcription activator of numerous oncogenes, such as SOX9, VEGFA, BCL2, and CDK2. The complex regulation of GLI1 involves numerous pathways and molecules, including HH-dependent and independent, epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Here, we report the discovery, characterization and function of a novel sense promoter-associated ncRNA, paGLI1 that is overexpressed in infiltrating glioma. We show that paGLI1 promotes GLI1 gene transcription through binding to and recruitment of the transcription factor complex FUS/P65 by interacting with paGLI1 DNA sequence. This interaction facilitates FUS/P65 binding to the GLI1 promoter to activate GLI1 transcription and hence its downstream oncogenes, which results in enhancement of glioma cell proliferation and invasiveness. Importantly, over-expression of paGLI1 is a significant unfavorable prognosticator for both disease-specific and progression-free survival in glioma patients, with relative risks being 2.932 (95% confidence interval: 1.280 to 6.713) (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and 2.284 (95% confidence interval: 1.051 to 4.966) (P &amp;lt; 0.05), respectively. The novel paGLI1/FUS/P65 regulatory mechanisms play important roles in infiltrating glioma progression and may serve as potential targets for future therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMPK/NFκB and NLRP3 interplay is a new therapeutic target in inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dapagliflozin mitigated lipopolysaccharide-mediated lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dapagliflozin anti-inflammatory effects were mediated through AMPK/NFĸB regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dapagliflozin inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is one the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. In this study, we examined for first time the role of dapagliflozin (DPGZ) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in rats and determined the underlying molecular mechanisms by evaluating the effects of DPGZ on adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK), nuclear transcription factor kappa B, nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor 3 inflammasome activation. Treatment of acute lung injured rats with either low dose (5 mg/kg) or high dose (10 mg/kg) DPGZ significantly decreased oxidative stress by decreasing malondialdehyde and nitric oxide tissue levels with a significant increase in spectrophotometric measurements of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and reduced glutathione levels. DPGZ treatment resulted in a significant anti-inflammatory effect as indicated by suppression in myeloperoxidase activity, MCP-1, IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α levels. DPGZ treatment also increased p-AMPK/t-AMPK with a significant reduction in NF-kB P65 binding activity and NFĸB p65 (pSer536) levels. These effects of DPGZ were accompanied by a significant reduction in NLRP3 levels and NLRP3 gene expression and a significant decrease in caspase-1 activity, which were also confirmed by histopathological examinations. We conclude that DPGZ antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity may occur through regulation of AMPK/NFĸB pathway and inhibition of NLRP3 activation. These results suggest that DPGZ represents a promising intervention for the treatment of ALI, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dihydroartemisinin enhances the anti-tumor activity of oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer cells by altering PRDX2-reactive oxygen species-mediated multiple signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35104762/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Oxaliplatin based treatments are frequently used as chemotherapeutic methods for CRC, however, associated side effects and drug resistance often limit their clinical application. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) induces apoptosis in various cancer cells by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, the direct target of DHA and underlying molecular mechanisms in oxaliplatin-mediated anti-tumor activities against CRC are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), flow cytometry, and colony formation assays to investigate cell phenotype alterations and ROS generation. We also used quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting to measure relative gene and protein expression. Finally, an in vivo mouse xenograft model was used to assess the anti-tumor activity of oxaliplatin and DHA alone, and combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; DHA synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor activity of oxaliplatin in colon cancer cells by regulating ROS-mediated ER stress, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), C-Jun-amino-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 signaling pathways. Mechanistically, DHA increased ROS levels by inhibiting peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) expression, and PRDX2 knockdown sensitized DHA-mediated cell growth inhibition and ROS production in CRC cells. A mouse xenograft model showed strong anti-tumor effects from combination treatments when compared with single agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrated an improved therapeutic strategy for CRC patients by combining DHA and oxaliplatin treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PAR1, a therapeutic target for remote lung injury associated with hind limb ischemia/reperfusion: ERK5/KLF2-dependent lung capillary barrier preservation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35031271/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is expressed in pneumocytes and endothelial cells of the alveolar barrier. Its activation by thrombin disrupts the barrier integrity dynamics and induces lung injury in in vitro and in vivo paradigms. Nonetheless, the role of PAR1, as a therapeutic target, in hind limb ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-mediated remote lung injury has been unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the potential benefit of PAR1 blockade using the selective antagonist SCH79797 in distant lung dysfunction following hind limb I/R injury with special emphasis on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5)/Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) axis. Rats were subdivided into control, bilateral hind limb I/R, SCH79797, and SCH79797+BIX02189 (ERK5 inhibitor) groups. PAR1 blockade, ERK5-dependently, alleviated alveolar barrier disruption as evidenced by reductions in both pulmonary systemic leakage of surfactant protein-D and lung fluid accumulation with increase in pulmonary claudin 5, vascular endothelial cadherin, and connexin 37 levels. Such improvements are downstream targets of the ERK5/KLF2-mediated sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) upregulated expression and pS536-nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 inhibition. SCH79797 effectively impedes the evoked inflammatory response and oxidative burst by suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, lipid peroxidation, and neutrophil infiltration while boosting the glutathione antioxidant defense. Accordingly, PAR1 could be a therapeutic target, where its blockade mitigated pulmonary-endothelial barrier disruption via mutual S1PR1 enhancement and NF-κB p65 inhibition following ERK5/KLF2 activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STAT6/VDR Axis Mitigates Lung Inflammatory Injury by Promoting Nrf2 Signaling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35047105/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung inflammatory injury is a global public health concern. It is characterized by infiltration of diverse inflammatory cells and thickening of pulmonary septum along with oxidative stress to airway epithelial cells. STAT6 is a nuclear transcription factor that plays a crucial role in orchestrating the immune response, but its function in tissue inflammatory injury has not been comprehensively studied. Here, we demonstrated that STAT6 activation can protect against particle-induced lung inflammatory injury by resisting oxidative stress. Specifically, genetic ablation of STAT6 was observed to worsen particle-induced lung injury mainly by disrupting the lungs&amp;rsquo; antioxidant capacity, as reflected by the downregulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, an increase in malondialdehyde levels, and a decrease in glutathione levels. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been previously proved to positively regulate Nrf2 signals. In this study, silencing VDR expression in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells consistently suppressed autophagy-mediated activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, thereby aggravating particle-induced cell damage. Mechanically, STAT6 activation promoted the nuclear translocation of VDR, which increased the transcription of autophagy-related genes and induced Nrf2 signals, and silencing VDR abolished these effects. Our research provides important insights into the role of STAT6 in oxidative damage and reveals its potential underlying mechanism. This information not only deepens the appreciation of STAT6 but also opens new avenues for the discovery of therapies for inflammatory respiratory system disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5 promotes pulmonary fibrosis by modulating β-catenin signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35013220/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal interstitial lung disease with limited therapeutic options. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5 (ACP5) performs a variety of functions. However, its role in IPF remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of ACP5 are increased in IPF patient samples and mice with bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In particular, higher levels of ACP5 are present in the sera of IPF patients with a diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbonmonoxide (DLCO) less than 40% of the predicted value. Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Acp5&lt;/em&gt; deficiency protects mice from BLM-induced lung injury and fibrosis coupled with a significant reduction of fibroblast differentiation and proliferation. Mechanistic studies reveal that Acp5 is upregulated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in a TGF-β receptor 1 (TGFβR1)/Smad family member 3 (Smad3)-dependent manner, after which Acp5 dephosphorylates p-β-catenin at serine 33 and threonine 41, inhibiting the degradation of β-catenin and subsequently enhancing β-catenin signaling in the nucleus, which promotes the differentiation, proliferation and migration of fibroblast. More importantly, the treatment of mice with &lt;em&gt;Acp5&lt;/em&gt; siRNA-loaded liposomes or Acp5 inhibitor reverses established lung fibrosis. In conclusions, Acp5 is involved in the initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis and strategies aimed at silencing or suppressing Acp5 could be considered as potential therapeutic approaches against pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-Covid pulmonary fibrosis is evident following severe COVID-19. There is an urgent need to identify the cellular and pathophysiological characteristics of chronic lung squeals of Covid-19 for the development of future preventive and/or therapeutic interventions. Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells can mediate local immune protection against infections and cancer. Less beneficially, lung TRM cells cause chronic airway inflammation and fibrosis by stimulating pathologic inflammation. The effects of Janus kinase (JAK), an inducer pathway of cytokine storm, inhibition on acute Covid-19 cases have been previously evaluated. Here, we propose that Tofacitinib by targeting the CD8+ TRM cells could be a potential candidate for the treatment of chronic lung diseases induced by acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TNF-α Induces Neutrophil Apoptosis Delay and Promotes Intestinal Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Lung Injury through Activating JNK/FoxO3a Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35003520/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Intestinal ischemia is a common clinical critical illness. Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IIR) leads to acute lung injury (ALI), but the causative factors of ALI are unknown. The aim of this study was to reveal the causative factors and mechanisms of IIR-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A mouse model of IIR was developed using C57BL/6 mice, followed by detection of lung injury status and plasma levels of inflammatory factors in sham-operated mice and model mice. Some model mice were treated with a tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor lenalidomide (10 mg/kg), followed by observation of lung injury status through hematoxylin and eosin staining and detection of neutrophil infiltration levels through naphthol esterase and Ly6G immunohistochemical staining. Additionally, peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were cultured &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and then stimulated by TNF-α to mimic &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; inflammatory stimuli; this TNF-α stimulation was also performed on PMNs after knockdown of FoxO3a or treatment with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. PMN apoptosis after stimulation was detected using flow cytometry. Finally, the role of PMN apoptosis in IIR-induced lung injury was evaluated in vivo by detecting the ALI status in the model mice administered with ABT-199, a Bcl-2 inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; IIR led to pulmonary histopathological injury and increased lung water content, which were accompanied by increased plasma levels of inflammatory factors, with the TNF-α plasma level showing the most pronounced increase. Inhibition of TNF-α led to effective reduction of lung tissue injury, especially that of the damaging infiltration of PMNs in the lung. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; knockdown of FoxO3a or inhibition of JNK activity could inhibit TNF-α-induced PMN apoptosis. Further &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments revealed that ABT-199 effectively alleviated lung injury and decreased inflammation levels by promoting PMN apoptosis during IIR-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; TNF-α activates the JNK/FoxO3a pathway to induce a delay in PMN apoptosis, which promotes IIR-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astragaloside IV pre-treatment attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats: Impact on autophagy, apoptosis and inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35026504/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autophagy flux inhibition is a critical mechanism of PM2.5-induced lung toxicity in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 triggered pulmonary inflammation by tipping the balance between autophagy and apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV increased autophagic flux and inhibited apoptosis and inflammation by activation of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in a PM2.5-induced rat lung toxicity model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm, exerts serious lung toxicity. At present, effective prevention measures and treatment modalities for pulmonary toxicity caused by PM2.5 are lacking. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is a natural product that has received increasing attention from researchers for its unique biological functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate the protective effects of AS-IV on PM2.5-induced pulmonary toxicity and identify its potential mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The rat model of PM2.5-induced lung toxicity was created by intratracheal instillation of PM2.5 dust suspension. The investigation was performed with AS-IV or in combination with autophagic flux inhibitor (Chloroquine) or AMP-sensitive protein kinase (AMPK)-specific inhibitor (Compound C). Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxy-nucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and western blotting. Autophagy was detected by immunofluorescence staining, autophagic flux measurement, western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy. The AMPK/mTOR pathway was analyzed by western blotting. Inflammation was analyzed by western blotting and suspension array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; AS-IV prevented histopathological injury, inflammation, autophagy dysfunction, apoptosis, and changes in AMPK levels induced by PM2.5. AS-IV increased autophagic flux and inhibited apoptosis and inflammation by activating the AMPK/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. However, AS-IV had no protective effect on PM2.5-induced lung injury following treatment with Compound C or Chloroquine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; AS-IV prevented PM2.5-induced lung toxicity by restoring the balance among autophagy, apoptosis, and inflammation in rats by activating the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octreotide is a synthetic octapeptide of natural somatostatin. We aimed to investigate the influence of Octreotide on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human pulmonary epithelial cell damage. After stimulated by LPS, BEAS-2B cells were treated with various concentrations of Octreotide. CCK-8 assay and LDH kits were to evaluate cell cytotoxicity. ELISA kits were to analyze the levels of inflammatory factors. TUNEL staining was to measure cell apoptosis. Western blot assay was used to assess the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, autophagy-related proteins and AKT/mTOR signaling-related proteins. Then, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) was adopted for treating BEAS-2B cells to determine its effects on inflammation and apoptosis. Afterward, adding AKT agonist (SC79) or mTOR antagonist (rapamycin) to explore the impact of Octreotide on autophagy. Results revealed that Octreotide notably enhanced cell viability and reduced LDH activity. The levels of inflammatory factors were significantly decreased following Octreotide treatment. Additionally, Octreotide attenuated the apoptotic capacity of LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells, led to the up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein level while cut down the protein levels of Bax and cleaved caspase3. Remarkably, the expression of autophagy-related protein LC3II/I and Beclin1 was elevated after Octreotide administration. Importantly, the suppressive effects of Octreotide on the inflammation and apoptosis of LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells was abrogated by 3-MA. Further experiments suggested that Octreotide downregulated p-AKT and mTOR expression in LPS-stimulated BEAS-2B cells. SC79 addition inhibited autophagy, evidenced by downregulated LC3II/I and Beclin1 expression while rapamycin presented the opposite effects. To conclude, Octreotide activates autophagy to alleviate LPS-induced pulmonary epithelial cell injury by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disulfiram (DSF) attenuated MCMV-infected pneumonia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSF suppressed NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway in MCMV-infected mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSF inhibited inflammatory response in MCMV-infected BMDMs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSF reduced viral loads in MCMV-infected mice and BMDMs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals is associated with damaging hyperinflammation and leads to high morbidity and mortality. It is urgently needed to develop new strategies to treat CMV-induced pneumonia. As disulfiram (DSF) reportedly inhibits inflammatory responses in different disease models, its therapeutic effects in CMV-induced pneumonia are proposed. In this study, we demonstrated that DSF effectively attenuated pulmonary injury and improved survival in murine CMV (MCMV) pneumonia model. DSF treatment inhibited lung inflammatory responses, e.g. reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokine, and lowering the accumulation of leukocytes in the lung. Similar to the in vivo results, DSF attenuated inflammatory responses and modulated NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in MCMV-infected BMDMs. Furthermore, DSF reduced pulmonary fibrosis and viral loads in MCMV pneumonia mice and BMDMs. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory effects of DSF may due to its regulating NF-κB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Collectively, our results suggest that DSF-mediated anti-hyperinflammatory effects have potentials for therapy of human CMV pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exploring the molecular mechanisms of the inhibition of acrolein-induced BEAS-2B cytotoxicity by luteolin using network pharmacology and cell biology technology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acrolein is a highly reactive unsaturated hazardous air pollutant, which is extremely irritating to the respiratory tract. Luteolin, an active flavonoid compound, possesses multiple biological activities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mechanism of the inhibition of acrolein-induced human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells cytotoxicity by luteolin using network pharmacology and cell biology technology. Firstly, network pharmacology results indicated that oxidative stress processes might play an important role in luteolin inhibiting lung injury. Next, it was verified at the cellular level. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation increased, glutathione (GSH) level decreased after exposure to acrolein. MAPK signaling pathways were activated, which activated downstream IκBα/NF-κB signaling pathways. Meanwhile, acrolein caused oxidative DNA damage and double-strand breaks, induced DNA damage response (DDR) and apoptosis. These adverse effects were significantly reversed by luteolin, which inhibited the activation of MAPK/IκBα/NF-κB and DDR pathways, and reduced the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Moreover, luteolin also had a similar effect to antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in the regulation of signaling transduction mechanisms, which indicated that the regulation of oxidative stress played an important role in the process. These results provide an experimental basis for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the inhibition of acrolein-induced BEAS-2B cytotoxicity with luteolin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective effect of pteryxin on LPS-induced acute lung injury via modulating MAPK/NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34942323/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance:&lt;/em&gt; Peucedanum praeruptorum seed root is a common medicinal herb with antipyretic, expectorant, antitussive, and therapeutic effects against bronchitis and furuncle. The roots of this herb contain many coumarin compounds, including pteryxin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim of this study:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate whether pteryxin can alleviate the LPS-induced lung injury and the mechanism involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Material and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male BALB/C mice were orally given sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na) (0.5%, 1mL/100g) and pteryxin (suspended in CMC-Na; 0.5%) at 5, 10, 25 mg/kg once daily for 7 days. Subsequently, the mice received a single intratracheal instillation of 5 mg/kg LPS or saline as the control. After 8 hours, the mice were sacrificed to collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues. These samples were used to determine the lung W/D (wet/dry) weight ratio, total protein (TP) levels, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) and expression of protein involved in MAPK/NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome. H&amp;amp;E staining was carried out on tissue sections to explore the pathological alterations induced by LPS. The protein expression of F4/80 and NLRP3 in lung tissues was analyzed using immunohistochemical staining. The binding of pteryxin to target proteins (MAPK, NF-κB and NLRP3) was determined based on molecular docking tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Treatment with pteryxin reduced the lung W/D weight ratio, total protein (TP) level and levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1 β) significantly. Therefore, it ameliorated LPS-induced inflammatory response in BALB/C mice. Moreover, pteryxin suppressed LPS-induced upregulation of proteins involved in MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The expression level of F4/80 and NLRP3 was also downregulated by pteryxin pretreatment in lung tissues. Docking analysis revealed that pteryxin bound to target proteins (MAPK, NF- κB and NLRP3) with a fit-well pattern .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Pteryxin may attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury by dampening MAPK/NF-κB signaling and NLRP 3 inflammasome activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STING-Mediated Interferon Induction by Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Requires the Protein Tyrosine Kinase Syk</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34933455/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature and the intensity of innate immune response to virus infection determine the course of pathogenesis in the host. Among the many pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors, STING, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein, plays a pivotal role in triggering responses to microbial or cellular cytoplasmic DNA. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a common human pathogen, activates STING signaling, and the resultant induction of type I interferon causes inhibition of virus replication. In this context, we have observed that phosphorylation of Tyr245 of STING by epidermal growth factor receptor kinase is necessary for interferon induction. Here, we report that phosphorylation of Tyr240 by the tyrosine kinase Syk is essential for all signaling activities of STING. Our analysis showed that upon ligand-binding, STING dimerizes and interacts with membrane-bound EGFR, which autophosphorylates and provides the platform for the recruitment of cytoplasmic Syk to the signaling complex and its activation. Activated Syk phosphorylates Tyr240 of STING, followed by phosphorylation of Tyr245 by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Pharmacological or genetic ablation of Syk activity resulted in an arrest of STING in the ER compartment and a complete block of gene induction. Consequently, in the absence of Syk, HSV-1 could not induce interferon, and it replicated more robustly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune response to virus infection leads to interferon production and inhibition of viral replication. STING, an ER-bound protein, mediates such a response to cytoplasmic cellular or microbial DNA. HSV-1, a DNA virus, activates STING, and it replicates more efficiently in the absence of STING signaling. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tyr240 of STING by the protein tyrosine kinase Syk is essential for STING-mediated gene induction. To signal, ligand-activated STING recruits two kinases, Syk and EGFR, which phosphorylate Tyr240 and Tyr245, respectively. The dependence of STING signaling on Syk has broad significance, because STING plays a major role in many microbial, mitochondrial, and autoimmune diseases as well as in cancer development and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JFNE-A isolated from Jing-Fang n-butanol extract attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and the NF-κB signaling pathway via promotion of autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35026506/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Jing-Fang powder consists of Jingjie (Nepeta tenuifolia Benth, (Lamiaceae)). and Fangfeng (Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz.) Schischk, (Apiaceae)) Previous studies have revealed that the Jing-Fang powder n-butanol extract (JFNE) has anti-acute lung injury (ALI) and anti-inflammatory properties; however, the active ingredient and mechanism remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of a bioactive fraction obtained from JFNE(JFNE-A) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice and explored the underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design:&lt;/em&gt; The anti-acute lung injury effect and mechanism of JFNE-A was investigated by prophylactic administration of JFNE-A in mice with LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The expression levels of myeloperoxidase(MPO) in lung tissues of mice and interleukin(IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α, IL-1β, IL-5, interferon (IFN)-γ, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, and MIP-1β in bronchi alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were detected by reagent kit and the histological changes were examined by hematoxylin and eosin (H &amp;amp; E) for general histopathological conditions under a light microscope. In addition, the ultrastructure of the cells in lung tissues were observed and photographed under a transmission electron microscope. The expression levels of protein were detected via Western blotting and the mRNA expression of relative genes were determined of via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). What&amp;rsquo;s more, we also further clarified the potential targets of JFNE-A through network pharmacology analysis, which could be utilized in ALI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our results showed that pretreatment with JFNE-A for 7 days significantly reduced the lung pathological injury score, alleviated pulmonary edema, and decreased the lung tissue MPO level. Mechanistically, JFNE-A dramatically downregulated the protein levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, M-CSF, and IFN-γ in BALF and mRNA expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ in lung tissues. JFNE-A also significantly lowered the protein levels of iNOS and phosphorylated NF-κB (p65) and mRNA expression levels of iNOS, Rela, CHUK, and NF-κB1, and also elevated the protein expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and SOD1 and the mRNA expression levels of Nrf2, Hmox1, and Keap-1 in the lungs. Moreover, JFNE-A significantly decreased the protein expression of p62 and increased the ratio of LC3II/LC3I. It also upregulated the mRNA expression levels of Atg5 and Beclin-1, whereas it reduced the mRNA expression level of SQSTM1 and increased autophagosome structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Overall, treatment with JFNE-A ameliorated LPS-induced ALI in mice by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathways and promoting Nrf2 signaling pathways by accelerating autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of Secretoglobin&#43; (club cell) NFκB/RelA-TGFβ signaling in aero-allergen-induced epithelial plasticity and subepithelial myofibroblast transdifferentiation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34930252/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repetitive aeroallergen exposure is linked to sensitization and airway remodeling through incompletely understood mechanisms. In this study, we examine the dynamic mucosal response to cat dander extract (CDE), a ubiquitous aero-allergen linked to remodeling, sensitization and asthma. We find that daily exposure of CDE in naïve C57BL/6 mice activates innate neutrophilic inflammation followed by transition to a lymphocytic response associated with waves of mucosal transforming growth factor (TGF) isoform expression. In parallel, enhanced bronchiolar Smad3 expression and accumulation of phospho-SMAD3 was observed, indicating paracrine activation of canonical TGFβR signaling. CDE exposure similarly triggered epithelial cell plasticity, associated with expression of mesenchymal regulatory factors (&lt;em&gt;Snai1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Zeb1&lt;/em&gt;), reduction of epithelial markers (&lt;em&gt;Cdh1&lt;/em&gt;) and activation of the NFκB/RelA transcriptional activator. To determine whether NFκB functionally mediates CDE-induced growth factor response, mice were stimulated with CDE in the absence or presence of a selective IKK inhibitor. IKK inhibition substantially reduced the level of CDE-induced TGFβ1 expression, pSMAD3 accumulation, &lt;em&gt;Snai1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Zeb1&lt;/em&gt; expression. Activation of epithelial plasticity was demonstrated by flow cytometry in whole lung homogenates, where CDE induces accumulation of SMA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Epcam&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population. Club cells are important sources of cytokine and growth factor production. To determine whether Club cell innate signaling through NFκB/RelA mediated CDE induced TGFβ signaling, we depleted RelA in &lt;em&gt;Secretoglobin&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Scgb1a1&lt;/em&gt;)-expressing bronchiolar cells. Immunofluorescence-optical clearing light sheet microscopy showed a punctate distribution of Scgb1a1 progenitors throughout the small airway. We found that RelA depletion in Secretoglobin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells results in inhibition of the mucosal TGFβ response, blockade of EMT and reduced subepithelial myofibroblast expansion. We conclude that the Secretoglobin-derived bronchiolar cell is central to coordinating the innate response required for mucosal TGFβ1 response, EMT and myofibroblast expansion. These data have important mechanistic implications for how aero-allergens trigger mucosal injury response and remodeling in the small airway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dimethyl fumarate attenuates LPS induced septic acute kidney injury by suppression of NFκB p65 phosphorylation and macrophage activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34915410/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Septic acute kidney injury (AKI) always accounts for high mortality of septic patients in ICU. Due to its not well understood mechanism for infection and immune-regulation in kidney dysfunction, there is a lack of effective therapy without side effects. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) as an immunomodulatory molecule has been approved for treatment to multiple sclerosis. However, the therapeutic effect and immunomodulatory role underlying DMF action in septic AKI is unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of DMF in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic AKI involving macrophage regulation. In current study, we administered DMF by oral gavage to mice with LPS-induced AKI, then harvested serum and kidney at three different time points. We further isolated Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from mice and stimulated them with LPS followed by DMF treatment. To explore immunomodulatory role of DMF in macrophages, we depleted macrophages in mice using liposomal clodronate after DMF treatment upon LPS-induced septic AKI. Then we observed that DMF attenuated renal dysfunction and murine pathological kidney injury after LPS injection. DMF could inhibit translocation of phosphorylated NF-κB p65 and suppress macrophage activation in LPS-induced AKI. DMF reduced the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 whereas increased the secretion of IL-10 and Arg-1 in BMDMs after LPS stimulation. DMF also inhibited NF-κB p65 phosphorylation in BMDMs after LPS stimulation. Importantly, the effect of DMF against LPS-induced AKI, macrophage activation, and translocation of phosphorylated NF-κB p65 was impaired upon macrophage depletion. Thus, DMF could attenuate LPS-induced septic AKI by suppression of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and macrophage activation. This work suggested the potential therapeutic role of DMF for patients in ICU threatened by septic AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skeletal muscle is a regulator of the body&amp;rsquo;s energy expenditure and metabolism. Abnormal regulation of skeletal muscle-specific genes leads to various muscle diseases. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to play important roles in muscle growth and muscle atrophy. To explore the potential function of muscle-associated lncRNA, we analyzed our previous RNA-sequencing data and selected the lncRNA (&lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt;) as the research object. In this study, we report that &lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt; is specifically enriched in skeletal muscle, and its transcriptional activity is positively regulated by transcription factor SP1. &lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt; regulates myoblast proliferation and differentiation &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt; reduces intramuscular fat deposition, activates slow-twitch muscle phenotype, and inhibits muscle atrophy. Mechanistically, &lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt; binds to sarcoplasmic/ER calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2) protein to enhance SERCA2 protein stability and increase SERCA2 activity. Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt; improves mitochondrial efficiency possibly through a SERCA2-mediated activation of the AMPK pathway. Our findings provide a strategy for using &lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt; as an effective regulator for the treatment of muscle atrophy and energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The antifibrotic effect of pheretima protein is mediated by the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathway and attenuates inflammation in bleomycin-induced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance:&lt;/em&gt; Pheretima is a traditional Chinese medicine that could treat various lung diseases such as asthma, pneumonia, and lung cancer effectively; however, limited studies on the use of Pheretima protein in the treatment of lung diseases have been conducted to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim of the study:&lt;/em&gt; The aim of this study was to explain the antipulmonary fibrosis mechanism of the Pheretima protein and elucidate its possible cell signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Material and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Fresh pheretima was freeze-dried to obtain the Pheretima protein. Divide C57BL/6 mice into control and bleomycin (BLM)-induced models, pirfenidone, and Pheretima protein-treatment groups. Three weeks later, they were treated with H&amp;amp;E and Masson&amp;rsquo;s trichrome staining to assess lung injury and fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC), realtime-PCR (RT-PCR), and western blotting. Inflammation was assessed using the alveolar lavage fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Pheretima protein inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and reduced inflammation. It also reduced the levels of Smad2/3, pSmad2/3, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1). Thus, our results indicate that Pheretima protein can alleviate BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Pheretima protein inhibits ECM, EMT, and antiinflammatory markers, which in turn ameliorates BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that Pheretima protein can exert its biological activity by downregulating the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The deubiquitinase OTUD1 inhibits colonic inflammation by suppressing RIPK1-mediated NF-κB signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34876703/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3)-mediated ubiquitination and deubiquitinase (DUB)-mediated deubiquitination processes are closely associated with the occurrence and development of colonic inflammation. Ovarian tumor deubiquitinase 1 (OTUD1) is involved in immunoregulatory functions linked to infectious diseases. However, the effect of OTUD1 on intestinal immune responses during colonic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unclear. Here, we show that loss of OTUD1 in mice contributes to the pathogenesis of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis via excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that OTUD1 in hematopoietic cells plays a dominant role in protection against colitis. Mechanistically, OTUD1 physically interacts with receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and selectively cleaves K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIPK1 to inhibit the recruitment of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO). Moreover, the expression of OTUD1 in mucosa samples from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients was lower than that in mucosa samples from healthy controls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the UC-associated OTUD1 G430V mutation abolishes the ability of OTUD1 to inhibit RIPK1-mediated NF-κB activation and intestinal inflammation. Taken together, our study unveils a previously unexplored role of OTUD1 in moderating intestinal inflammation by inhibiting RIPK1-mediated NF-κB activation, suggesting that the OTUD1-RIPK1 axis could be a potential target for the treatment of IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Super-enhancer-driven lncRNA-DAW promotes liver cancer cell proliferation through activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34853732/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been reported in multiple cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms mediated by super-enhancers remain elusive. Here we sought to define the role of a novel lncRNA termed lncRNA-DAW in tumorigenesis. Our results revealed that lncRNA-DAW was driven by a liver-specific super-enhancer and transcriptionally activated by HNF4G, leading to frequent elevation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens. Ectopic expression of lncRNA-DAW promoted both in vivo and in vitro tumor growth. By using RNA sequencing, Wnt2 was screened out as a downstream effector of lncRNA-DAW. We next found that lncRNA-DAW physically interacted with EZH2, a negative regulator of Wnt2. This interplay subsequently potentiated CDK1-EZH2 interaction, leading to the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of EZH2. The lncRNA-DAW-mediated EZH2 degradation facilitated the de-repression of Wnt2 transcription, which eventually activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Furthermore, we verified that Wnt2 potentiated in vitro and in vivo cancer cell growth by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Finally, Wnt2 amplification was confirmed as a common event in liver cancer, and the expression of lncRNA-DAW was positively correlated with Wnt2 in HCC specimens. Collectively, we are the first to identify lncRNA-DAW as a novel candidate oncogene in liver cancer, and this lncRNA may serve as a novel clinical diagnosis biomarker for liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crossed Pathways for Radiation-Induced and Immunotherapy-Related Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34925345/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a form of radiation damage to normal lung tissue caused by radiotherapy (RT) for thoracic cancers, which is most commonly comprised of radiation pneumonitis (RP) and radiation pulmonary fibrosis (RPF). Moreover, with the widespread utilization of immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors as first- and second-line treatments for various cancers, the incidence of immunotherapy-related lung injury (IRLI), a severe immune-related adverse event (irAE), has rapidly increased. To date, we know relatively little about the underlying mechanisms and signaling pathways of these complications. A better understanding of the signaling pathways may facilitate the prevention of lung injury and exploration of potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, this review provides an overview of the signaling pathways of RILI and IRLI and focuses on their crosstalk in diverse signaling pathways as well as on possible mechanisms of adverse events resulting from combined radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Furthermore, this review proposes potential therapeutic targets and avenues of further research based on signaling pathways. Many new studies on pyroptosis have renewed appreciation for the value and importance of pyroptosis in lung injury. Therefore, the authors posit that pyroptosis may be the common downstream pathway of RILI and IRLI; discussion is also conducted regarding further perspectives on pyroptosis as a crucial signaling pathway in lung injury treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of clinical pulmonary edema and contributes to the development of acute lung injury (ALI). Here we reported that ruscogenin (RUS), an effective steroidal sapogenin of Radix Ophiopogon japonicus, attenuated lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced pulmonary endothelial barrier disruption through mediating non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMMHC IIA)‒Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) interactions. By in vivo and in vitro experiments, we observed that RUS administration significantly ameliorated LPS-triggered pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction and ALI. Moreover, we identified that RUS directly targeted NMMHC IIA on its N-terminal and head domain by serial affinity chromatography, molecular docking, biolayer interferometry, and microscale thermophoresis analyses. Downregulation of endothelial NMMHC IIA expression in vivo and in vitro abolished the protective effect of RUS. It was also observed that NMMHC IIA was dissociated from TLR4 and then activating TLR4 downstream Src/vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) signaling in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells after LPS treatment, which could be restored by RUS. Collectively, these findings provide pharmacological evidence showing that RUS attenuates LPS-induced pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction by inhibiting TLR4/Src/VE-cadherin pathway through targeting NMMHC IIA and mediating NMMHC IIA‒TLR4 interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Artemether confers neuroprotection on cerebral ischemic injury through stimulation of the Erk1/2-P90rsk-CREB signaling pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artemether conferred neuroprotection in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artemether conferred neuroprotection on oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion-induced cell injury model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artemether promoted the activation of Erk1/2-P90&lt;sup&gt;rsk&lt;/sup&gt;-CREB signaling pathway &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability among adults. Despite the economic burden of the disease, available treatment options are still very limited. With the exception of anti-thrombolytics and hypothermia, current therapies fail to reduce neuronal injury, neurological deficits and mortality rates, suggesting that the development of novel and more effective therapies against ischemic stroke is urgent. In the present study, we found that artemether, which has been used in the clinic as an anti-malarial drug, was able to improve the neurological deficits, attenuate the infarction volume and the brain water content in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal model. Furthermore, artemether treatment significantly suppressed cell apoptosis, stimulated cell proliferation and promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), P90&lt;sup&gt;rsk&lt;/sup&gt; and cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB). Artemether protective effect was attenuated by PD98059, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, administration. Similarly, in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/RP) cell models, artemether pre-treatment induced the suppression of the intracellular ROS, the down-regulation of LDH activity, the reduction of caspase 3 activity and of the apoptosis cell rate and reversed the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. As with MCAO animal model, artemether promoted the activation of Erk1/2-P90&lt;sup&gt;rsk&lt;/sup&gt;-CREB signaling pathway. This effect was blocked by the inhibition or knock-down of ERK1/2. The present study provides evidences of the neuroprotective effect of artemether unravelling its potential as a new therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refractory diabetic wounds can cause persistent inflammation and delayed healing due to hypoxia. Currently, no optimal solution is available. Exosomes of adipose stem cells (ADSCs-exo) may promote skin wound healing, however, molecular mechanisms remains mysterious. We found significantly enhanced survival and proliferation of adipose stem cells after hypoxia induction compared to normoxia. Here, we aimed to investigate if hypoxic adipose stem cells exosomes (HypADSCs-exo) participate in hypoxia adaptability and accelerate diabetic wound healing. Based on high-throughput sequencing, 215 microRNAs (miRNAs) were upregulated and 369 miRNAs downregulated in HypADSCs-exo compared to ADSCs-exo. Up-regulated miR-21-3p, miR-126-5p, miR-31-5p whereas down-regulated gene miR-99b and miR-146-a correlated with wound healing. According to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), miRNAs might regulate cell metabolism, differentiation and Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) function. Consistently, HpyADSCs-exo could promote diabetic wounds healing and inhibit inflammation through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Collectively, HpyADSCs-exo can promote diabetic wound healing as an alternative strategy to improve wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 9 (PARP9) as a noncanonical sensor for RNA virus in dendritic cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33976210/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate immune cells are critical in protective immunity against viral infections, involved in sensing foreign viral nucleic acids. Here we report that the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 9 (PARP9), a member of PARP family, serves as a non-canonical sensor for RNA virus to initiate and amplify type I interferon (IFN) production. We find knockdown or deletion of PARP9 in human or mouse dendritic cells and macrophages inhibits type I IFN production in response to double strand RNA stimulation or RNA virus infection. Furthermore, mice deficient for PARP9 show enhanced susceptibility to infections with RNA viruses because of the impaired type I IFN production. Mechanistically, we show that PARP9 recognizes and binds viral RNA, with resultant recruitment and activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT3 pathway, independent of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS). PI3K/AKT3 then activates the IRF3 and IRF7 by phosphorylating IRF3 at Ser385 and IRF7 at Ser437/438 mediating type I IFN production. Together, we reveal a critical role for PARP9 as a non-canonical RNA sensor that depends on the PI3K/AKT3 pathway to produce type I IFN. These findings may have important clinical implications in controlling viral infections and viral-induced diseases by targeting PARP9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered the roots of cancer metastasis and recurrence (CSCs), due in part to their self-renewal and therapy resistance properties. However, the underlying mechanisms for the regulation of CSC stemness are poorly understood. Recently, increasing evidence shows that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators for cancer cell function in various malignancies including breast cancer, but how lncRNAs regulate the function of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) remains to be determined. Herein, using lncRNA/mRNA microarray assays, a novel lncRNA (named lnc030) is identified, which is highly expressed in BCSCs in vitro and in vivo, as a pivotal regulator in maintaining BCSC stemness and promoting tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, lnc030 cooperates with poly(rC) binding protein 2(PCBP2) to stabilize squalene epoxidase (SQLE) mRNA, resulting in an increase of cholesterol synthesis. The increased cholesterol in turn actives PI3K/Akt signaling, which governs BCSC stemness. In summary, these findings demonstrate that a new, lnc030-based mechanism for regulating cholesterol synthesis and stemness properties of BCSCs. The lnc030-SQLE-cholesterol synthesis pathway may serve as an effective therapeutic target for BCSC elimination and breast cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In type 2 cardiorenal syndrome, chronic heart failure is thought to cause or promote chronic kidney disease; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the role of Wnt signaling in heart and kidney injury in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). At 8 weeks after TAC, cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis were prominent, and echocardiography confirmed impaired cardiac function. The cardiac lesions were accompanied by upregulation of multiple Wnt ligands and activation of β-catenin, as well as activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Wnt3a induced multiple components of the RAS in primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. TAC also caused proteinuria and kidney fibrosis, accompanied by klotho depletion and β-catenin activation in the kidney. Pharmacologic blockade of β-catenin with a small molecule inhibitor or the RAS with losartan ameliorated cardiac injury, restored heart function, and mitigated the renal lesions. Serum from TAC mice was sufficient to activate β-catenin and trigger tubular cell injury in vitro, indicating a role for circulating factors. Multiple inflammatory cytokines were upregulated in the circulation of TAC mice, and tumor necrosis factor-α was able to inhibit klotho, induce β-catenin activation, and cause tubular cell injury in vitro. These studies identify Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a common pathogenic mediator of heart and kidney injury in type 2 cardiorenal syndrome after TAC. Targeting this pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy to protect both organs in cardiorenal syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rapid evolution and conserved function of the piRNA pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transposons are major genome constituents that can mobilize and trigger mutations, DNA breaks and chromosome rearrangements. Transposon silencing is particularly important in the germline, which is dedicated to transmission of the inherited genome. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) guide a host defence system that transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally silences transposons during germline development. While germline control of transposons by the piRNA pathway is conserved, many piRNA pathway genes are evolving rapidly under positive selection, and the piRNA biogenesis machinery shows remarkable phylogenetic diversity. Conservation of core function combined with rapid gene evolution is characteristic of a host-pathogen arms race, suggesting that transposons and the piRNA pathway are engaged in an evolutionary tug of war that is driving divergence of the biogenesis machinery. Recent studies suggest that this process may produce biochemical incompatibilities that contribute to reproductive isolation and species divergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WNT signal transduction cascade is a main regulator of development throughout the animal kingdom. Wnts are also key drivers of most types of tissue stem cells in adult mammals. Unsurprisingly, mutated Wnt pathway components are causative to multiple growth-related pathologies and to cancer. Here, we describe the core Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, how it controls stem cells, and contributes to disease. Finally, we discuss strategies for Wnt-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transcriptional regulator STAT3 has key roles in vertebrate development and mature tissue function including control of inflammation and immunity. Mutations in human STAT3 associate with diseases such as immunodeficiency, autoimmunity and cancer. Strikingly, however, either hyperactivation or inactivation of STAT3 results in human disease, indicating tightly regulated STAT3 function is central to health. Here, we attempt to summarize information on the numerous and distinct biological actions of STAT3, and highlight recent discoveries, with a specific focus on STAT3 function in the immune and hematopoietic systems. Our goal is to spur investigation on mechanisms by which aberrant STAT3 function drives human disease and novel approaches that might be used to modulate disease outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of STAT3 in autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/25951043/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process in eukaryotes that eliminates harmful components and maintains cellular homeostasis in response to a series of extracellular insults. However, these insults may trigger the downstream signaling of another prominent stress responsive pathway, the STAT3 signaling pathway, which has been implicated in multiple aspects of the autophagic process. Recent reports further indicate that different subcellular localization patterns of STAT3 affect autophagy in various ways. For example, nuclear STAT3 fine-tunes autophagy via the transcriptional regulation of several autophagy-related genes such as BCL2 family members, BECN1, PIK3C3, CTSB, CTSL, PIK3R1, HIF1A, BNIP3, and microRNAs with targets of autophagy modulators. Cytoplasmic STAT3 constitutively inhibits autophagy by sequestering EIF2AK2 as well as by interacting with other autophagy-related signaling molecules such as FOXO1 and FOXO3. Additionally, the mitochondrial translocation of STAT3 suppresses autophagy induced by oxidative stress and may effectively preserve mitochondria from being degraded by mitophagy. Understanding the role of STAT3 signaling in the regulation of autophagy may provide insight into the classic autophagy model and also into cancer therapy, especially for the emerging targeted therapy, because a series of targeted agents execute antitumor activities via blocking STAT3 signaling, which inevitably affects the autophagy pathway. Here, we review several of the representative studies and the current understanding in this particular field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting STAT3 in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a point of convergence for numerous oncogenic signaling pathways, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is central in regulating the anti-tumor immune response. STAT3 is broadly hyperactivated both in cancer and non-cancerous cells within the tumor ecosystem and plays important roles in inhibiting the expression of crucial immune activation regulators and promoting the production of immunosuppressive factors. Therefore, targeting the STAT3 signaling pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for numerous cancers. In this review, we outline the importance of STAT3 signaling pathway in tumorigenesis and its immune regulation, and highlight the current status for the development of STAT3-targeting therapeutic approaches. We also summarize and discuss recent advances in STAT3-based combination immunotherapy in detail. These endeavors provide new insights into the translational application of STAT3 in cancer and may contribute to the promotion of more effective treatments toward malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;
