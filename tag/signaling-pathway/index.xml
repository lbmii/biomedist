      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an inevitable process in renal transplantation that significantly increases the risk of delayed graft function, acute rejection, and even graft loss. Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) is an important receptor in multiple septic and aseptic injuries, but its functions in kidney IRI are still unclear. This study was designed to reveal the pathological role of FPR2 in kidney IRI and its functional mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To explore the mechanism of FPR2 in kidney IRI, the model rats were sacrificed after IRI surgery. Immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and western blotting were used to detect differences in the expression of FPR2 and its ligands between the IRI and control groups. WRW4 (WRWWWW-NH2), a specific antagonist of FPR2, was administered to kidney IRI rats. Kidney function and pathological damage were detected to assess kidney injury and recovery. Flow cytometry was used to quantitatively compare neutrophil infiltration among the experimental groups. Mitochondrial formyl peptides (mtFPs) were synthesized and administered to primary rat neutrophils together with the specific FPR family antagonist WRW4 to verify our hypothesis in vitro. Western blotting and cell function assays were used to examine the functions and signaling pathways that FPR2 mediates in neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; FPR2 was activated mainly by mtFPs during the acute phase of IRI, mediating neutrophil migration and reactive oxygen species production in the rat kidney through the ERK1/2 pathway. FPR2 blockade in the early phase protected rat kidneys from IRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; mtFPs activated FPR2 during the acute phase of IRI and mediated rat kidney injury by activating the migration and reactive oxygen species generation of neutrophils through the ERK1/2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exposure to polystyrene microplastics triggers lung injury via targeting toll-like receptor 2 and activation of the NF-κB signal in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36641069/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are ubiquitous pollutants with a wide range of plastic applications. More recently, microplastics are in the air and can be inhaled into the lungs, causing respiratory diseases. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms by which microplastics may induce respiratory disease is still limited. This study used intranasal instillation to develop a model of lung injury. The histopathology result showed that the mouse lung had severe inflammatory responses, apoptosis and collagen deposition with chronic exposure to different sizes (Small: 1–5 μm and Large: 10–20 μm) of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPS), and the damage of smaller sizes was obvious. The expression levels of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) family, evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors, were detected, and the levels of TLR2 mRNA was significantly increased. In transfection experiments, PS-MPS increased the inflammatory response in HEK293 cells with TLR2 expression. Furthermore, exposure to small polystyrene microplastics promoted oxidative stress and apoptosis, and accelerated the process of fibrosis. Interestingly, inhibition of the NF-κB signal relieves inflammation and oxidative stress, reduces apoptosis, and thus controls the fibrosis process. These results suggested that PS-MPS targeted binding to TLR2 and further exacerbated fibrosis by facilitating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis with the activation of NF-κB signal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Onychiol B attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation via MAPK/NF-κB pathways and acute lung injury in vivo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B inhibits the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B prevents the production of ROS and reduced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B alleviates pulmonary edema, reverses inflammatory mediator TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-β secretion in lung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a devastating respiratory disorder characterized by rapid alveolar injury, uncontrolled inflammatory response, etc. Onychiol B is a cyathane diterpene originally isolated from fern plants. In this study, onychiol B can inhibit the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as NO, iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells by restraining the NF-κB and the p38 MAPK pathway. In addition, it prevents the production of ROS and reduces the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, in the acute lung injury mouse model induced by LPS injected into the trachea, onychiol B alleviates pulmonary edema, reverses inflammatory mediator TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-β secretion in lung. In general, our data show that significant anti-ALI effects of onychiol B would render it a potential candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oxidative stress-triggered Wnt signaling perturbation characterizes the tipping point of lung adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36627278/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lkb1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency confers the Kras-mutant lung cancer with strong plasticity and the potential for adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation (AST). However, it remains largely unknown how &lt;em&gt;Lkb1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency dynamically regulates AST. Using the classical AST mouse model (&lt;em&gt;Kras&lt;sup&gt;LSL-G12D/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Lkb1&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, KL), we here comprehensively analyze the temporal transcriptomic dynamics of lung tumors at different stages by dynamic network biomarker (DNB) and identify the tipping point at which the Wnt signaling is abruptly suppressed by the excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through its downstream effector FOXO3A. Bidirectional genetic perturbation of the Wnt pathway using two different &lt;em&gt;Ctnnb1&lt;/em&gt; conditional knockout mouse strains confirms its essential role in the negative regulation of AST. Importantly, pharmacological activation of the Wnt pathway before but not after the tipping point inhibits squamous transdifferentiation, highlighting the irreversibility of AST after crossing the tipping point. Through comparative transcriptomic analyses of mouse and human tumors, we find that the lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma form a &amp;ldquo;Yin-Yang&amp;rdquo; counteracting network. Interestingly, inactivation of the Wnt pathway preferentially suppresses the adenomatous lineage TF network and thus disrupts the &amp;ldquo;Yin-Yang&amp;rdquo; homeostasis to lean towards the squamous lineage, whereas ectopic expression of NKX2-1, an adenomatous lineage TF, significantly dampens such phenotypic transition accelerated by the Wnt pathway inactivation. The negative correlation between the Wnt pathway and AST is further observed in a large cohort of human lung adenosquamous carcinoma. Collectively, our study identifies the tipping point of AST and highlights an essential role of the ROS-Wnt axis in dynamically orchestrating the homeostasis between adeno- and squamous-specific TF networks at the AST tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myofibroblast-Specific Inhibition of the Rho Kinase-MRTF-SRF Pathway Using Nanotechnology for the Prevention of Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36625494/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of myofibroblasts in the lung and progressive tissue scarring. Fibroblasts exist across a spectrum of states, from quiescence in health to activated myofibroblasts in the setting of injury. Highly activated myofibroblasts have a critical role in the establishment of fibrosis as the predominant source of type 1 collagen and pro-fibrotic mediators. Myofibroblasts are also highly contractile cells and can alter lung biomechanical properties through tissue contraction. . One of the ways myofibroblast activation occurs is through activation of the Rho/myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) / serum response factor (SRF) pathway, which signals through intracellular actin polymerization. However, concerns surrounding the pleiotropic and ubiquitous nature of these signaling pathways have limited the translation of inhibitory drugs. Herein, we demonstrate a novel therapeutic anti-fibrotic strategy utilizing myofibroblast-targeted nanoparticles containing a MTRF/SRF pathway inhibitor (CCG-1423) which has been shown to block myofibroblast activation in vitro. Myofibroblasts were preferentially targeted via the angiotensin 2 receptor, which has been shown to be selectively upregulated in animal and human studies. These nanoparticles were non-toxic and accumulated in lung myofibroblasts in the bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, reducing the number of these activated cells and their production of pro-fibrotic mediators. Ultimately, in a murine model of lung fibrosis, a single injection of these drug containing targeted nanoagents reduced fibrosis as compared to control mice. This approach has the potential to deliver personalized therapy by precisely targeting signaling pathways in a cell-specific manner, allowing increased efficacy with reduced deleterious off-target effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell transcriptomics reveals a mechanosensitive injury signaling pathway in early diabetic nephropathy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36627643/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, and histopathologic glomerular lesions are among the earliest structural alterations of DN. However, the signaling pathways that initiate these glomerular alterations are incompletely understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To delineate the cellular and molecular basis for DN initiation, we performed single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing of renal cells from type 2 diabetes mice (BTBR ob/ob) at the early stage of DN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed glucose-independent responses in glomerular cell types. The gene regulatory network upstream of glomerular cell programs suggested the activation of mechanosensitive transcriptional pathway MRTF-SRF predominantly taking place in mesangial cells. Importantly, activation of MRTF-SRF transcriptional pathway was also identified in DN glomeruli in independent patient cohort datasets. Furthermore, ex vivo kidney perfusion suggested that the regulation of MRTF-SRF is a common mechanism in response to glomerular hyperfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Overall, our study presents a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of early DN, highlighting mechanosensitive signaling pathways as novel targets of diabetic glomerulopathy.Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of innate immune cGAS-STING pathway contributes to Alzheimer’s pathogenesis in 5×FAD mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/s43587-022-00337-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cGAS senses microbial and host-derived double-stranded DNA in cytoplasm to trigger cellular innate immune response in a STING-dependent manner; however, it remains unknown whether the cGAS-STING pathway in innate immunity contributes to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here we demonstrated the detectable binding of the cGAS double-stranded DNA in cytoplasm and the activation of the microglial cGAS-STING pathway in brains of human AD and aged mice. &lt;em&gt;Cgas&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; 5×FAD mice were largely protected from cognitive impairment, amyloid-β pathology, neuroinflammation and other sequelae associated with AD. Furthermore, &lt;em&gt;Cgas&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in microglia inhibited a neurotoxic A1 astrocytic phenotype and thus alleviated oligomeric amyloid-β peptide-induced neurotoxicity. Finally, administration of STING inhibitor H-151 potently suppressed the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and ameliorated AD pathogenesis in 5×FAD mice. In conclusion, our present study has identified a critical molecular link between innate immunity and AD and suggests that therapeutic targeting of the cGAS-STING pathway activity might effectively interfere with the progression of AD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A DLG1-ARHGAP31-CDC42 axis is essential for the intestinal stem cell response to fluctuating niche Wnt signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36640764/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polarity of the mammalian intestinal epithelium is independent of &lt;em&gt;Dlg1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of &lt;em&gt;Dlg1&lt;/em&gt; in ISCs results in cell death under high Wnt conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISCs lacking &lt;em&gt;Dlg1&lt;/em&gt; have impaired cell division and migration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canonical WNT ligands activate non-canonical Wnt signaling via DLG1-ARHGAP31-CDC42&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central factor in the maintenance of tissue integrity is the response of stem cells to variations in the levels of niche signals. In the gut, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) depend on Wnt ligands for self-renewal and proliferation. Transient increases in Wnt signaling promote regeneration after injury or in inflammatory bowel diseases, whereas constitutive activation of this pathway leads to colorectal cancer. Here, we report that Discs large 1 (&lt;em&gt;Dlg1&lt;/em&gt;), although dispensable for polarity and cellular turnover during intestinal homeostasis, is required for ISC survival in the context of increased Wnt signaling. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and genetic mouse models demonstrated that DLG1 regulates the cellular response to increased canonical Wnt ligands. This occurs via the transcriptional regulation of &lt;em&gt;Arhgap31&lt;/em&gt;, a GTPase-activating protein that deactivates CDC42, an effector of the non-canonical Wnt pathway. These findings reveal a DLG1-ARHGAP31-CDC42 axis that is essential for the ISC response to increased niche Wnt signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Commensal microbiome promotes hair follicle regeneration by inducing keratinocyte HIF-1α signaling and glutamine metabolism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue injury induces metabolic changes in stem cells, which likely modulate regeneration. Using a model of organ regeneration called wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN), we identified skin-resident bacteria as key modulators of keratinocyte metabolism, demonstrating a positive correlation between bacterial load, glutamine metabolism, and regeneration. Specifically, through comprehensive multiomic analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing in murine skin, we show that bacterially induced hypoxia drives increased glutamine metabolism in keratinocytes with attendant enhancement of skin and hair follicle regeneration. In human skin wounds, topical broad-spectrum antibiotics inhibit glutamine production and are partially responsible for reduced healing. These findings reveal a conserved and coherent physiologic context in which bacterially induced metabolic changes improve the tolerance of stem cells to damage and enhance regenerative capacity. This unexpected proregenerative modulation of metabolism by the skin microbiome in both mice and humans suggests important methods for enhancing regeneration after injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HERC3 promotes YAP/TAZ stability and tumorigenesis independently of its ubiquitin ligase activity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36598329/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YAP/TAZ transcriptional co-activators play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis. In the Hippo pathway, diverse signals activate the MST-LATS kinase cascade that leads to YAP/TAZ phosphorylation, and subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by SCFβ-TrCP. When the MST-LATS kinase cascade is inactive, unphosphorylated or dephosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocate into the nucleus to mediate TEAD-dependent gene transcription. Hippo signaling-independent YAP/TAZ activation in human malignancies has also been observed, yet the mechanism remains largely elusive. Here, we report that the ubiquitin E3 ligase HERC3 can promote YAP/TAZ activation independently of its enzymatic activity. HERC3 directly binds to β-TrCP, blocks its interaction with YAP/TAZ, and thus prevents YAP/TAZ ubiquitination and degradation. Expression levels of HERC3 correlate with YAP/TAZ protein levels and expression of YAP/TAZ target genes in breast tumor cells and tissues. Accordingly, knockdown of HERC3 expression ameliorates tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells. Our results establish HERC3 as a critical regulator of the YAP/TAZ stability and a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TRIM27 maintains gut homeostasis by promoting intestinal stem cell self-renewal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of gut homeostasis is associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder affecting approximately 11.2% of the global population. The poorly understood pathogenesis of IBS has impeded its treatment. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing 27 (TRIM27) is weakly expressed in IBS but highly expressed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a frequent chronic organic gastrointestinal disorder. Accordingly, knockout of &lt;em&gt;Trim27&lt;/em&gt; in mice causes spontaneously occurring IBS-like symptoms, including increased visceral hyperalgesia and abnormal stool features, as observed in IBS patients. Mechanistically, TRIM27 stabilizes β-catenin and thus activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote intestinal stem cell (ISC) self-renewal. Consistent with these findings, &lt;em&gt;Trim27&lt;/em&gt; deficiency disrupts organoid formation, which is rescued by reintroducing TRIM27 or β-catenin. Furthermore, Wnt/β-catenin signaling activator treatment ameliorates IBS symptoms by promoting ISC self-renewal. Taken together, these data indicate that TRIM27 is critical for maintaining gut homeostasis, suggesting that targeting the TRIM27/Wnt/β-catenin axis could be a potential treatment strategy for IBS. Our study also indicates that TRIM27 might serve as a potential biomarker for differentiating IBS from IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Delay Diabetic Wound Healing by Inducing Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition via the Hippo pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36594092/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are among the most frequent complications of diabetes with significant morbidity and mortality. Diabetes can trigger neutrophils to undergo histone citrullination by protein arginine deiminase 4 (encoded by Padi4 in mice) and release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The specific mechanism of NETs-mediated wound healing impairment in diabetes remains unknown. In this study, we show neutrophils are more susceptible to NETosis in diabetic wound environments. Via in vitro experiments and in vivo models of wound healing using wide-type and Padi4 -/- mice, we demonstrate NETs can induce the activation of PAK2 via the membrane receptor TLR-9. Then PAK2 phosphorylates the intracellular protein Merlin/NF2 to inhibit the Hippo-YAP pathway. YAP binds to transcription factor SMAD2 and translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to promote endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which ultimately impedes angiogenesis and delays wound healing. Suppression of the Merlin/YAP/SMAD2 pathway can attenuate NET-induced EndMT. Inhibition of NETosis accelerates wound healing by reducing EndMT and promoting angiogenesis. Cumulatively, these data suggest NETosis delays diabetic wound healing by inducing EndMT via the Hippo-YAP pathway. Increased understanding of the molecular mechanism that regulates NETosis and EndMT will be of considerable value for providing cellular targets amenable to therapeutic intervention for DFUs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lycopene Attenuates Di(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate-Induced Mitochondrial Damage and Inflammation in Kidney via cGAS-STING Signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36583613/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a highly harmful and persistent environmental pollutant. Due to its unique chemical composition, it frequently dissolves and enters the environment to endanger human and animal health. Lycopene is a natural bioactive component that can potentially reduce the risk of environmental factor-induced chronic diseases. The present study sought to explore the role and underlying mechanism of lycopene (LYC) on DEHP-induced renal inflammatory response and apoptosis. In this study, mice were orally treated with LYC (5 mg/kg BW/day) and/or DEHP (500 or 1000 mg/kg BW/day) for 28 days. Our results indicated that LYC prevented DEHP-induced histopathological alterations and ultrastructural injuries, including decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), PINK1/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy, and mitochondrial energetic deficit. When damaged mitochondria release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into cytosol, LYC can alleviate inflammation and apoptosis caused by DEHP exposure by activating the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS-STING) signal pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrate that LYC can reduce mitophagy caused by DEHP exposure by activating the PINK1/Parkin pathway and then reduce renal inflammation and apoptosis through the cGAS-STING pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oleocanthal alleviated lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in chickens by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36640559/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of oleocanthal (OC) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in chickens and its possible mechanisms. In total, 20 chickens were randomly divided into 4 groups: control (CON) group, LPS group, LPS + OC group, and OC group. LPS + OC and OC groups were intragastrically administered a 5 mg/kg·d OC dose for 7 d. On d 8, the LPS group and LPS + OC group were intratracheally administered 2 mg/kg LPS for 12 h. It was found that OC ameliorated the pathological morphology and significantly suppressed apoptosis after OC treatment in LPS-induced ALI chicken (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Antioxidant capacity was higher in the LPS + OC group compared with the LPS group (P &amp;lt; 0.01). OC downregulated the related genes and proteins expression of toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-κB (TLR4/NF-κB) pathway in LPS group (P &amp;lt; 0.01). In conclusion, OC supplementation can alleviate LPS-induced ALI in chickens by suppressing apoptosis, enhancing lung antioxidant capacities and inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway activation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. alleviate LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. protect mice by reducing pulmonary edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. inhibit the influx of inflammatory cells into the lung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. reduce inflammation in the lung by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common respiratory disease in clinics, which is characterized by alveolar-capillary membrane loss, plasma protein leakage, pulmonary edema, massive neutrophil infiltration, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators. Rhodiola rosea L. an adaptogenic plant rich in phenylethanoloids, phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. We hope to verify the relieving effect of total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. (RTG) on ALI in mice and clarify its mechanism through this study. In this study, we identified the effect and mechanism of RTG on ALI through LPS-induced ALI mice. After RTG treatment, the pathological structure of lung tissue in ALI mice induced by LPS was significantly improved, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells was reduced. In addition, RTG reduced the production of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the serum of ALI mice and reduced the content or activity of MPO, T-SOD, GSH, and MDA in lung tissue. RNAseq analysis showed that RTG ameliorated LPS-induced ALI through anti-inflammatory, reduced immune response, and anti-apoptotic activities. The western blotting analysis confirmed that RTG could down-regulate the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB p65, and p-IκBα/IκBα. These results suggest that RTG can attenuate LPS-induced ALI through antioxidants and inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resolution of post-lung transplant ischemia-reperfusion injury is modulated via Resolvin D1-FPR2 and Maresin 1-LGR6 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36628837/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Dysregulation of inflammation-resolution pathways leads to postlung transplant (LTx) ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and allograft dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that combined treatment with specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, that is, Resolvin D1 (RvD1) and Maresin-1 (MaR1), enhances inflammation-resolution of lung IR injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Expression of RvD1 and MaR1 was analyzed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients on days 0, 1, and 7 post-LTx. Lung IR injury was evaluated in C57BL/6 (WT), FPR2-/-, and LGR6 siRNA treated mice using a hilar-ligation model with or without administration with RvD1 and/or MaR1. A donation after circulatory death and murine orthotopic lung transplantation model was used to evaluate the protection by RvD1 and MaR1 against lung IR injury. In vitro studies analyzed alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cell activation after treatment with RvD1 or MaR1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; RvD1 and MaR1 expressions in BAL from post-LTx patients was significantly increased on day 7 compared to days 0 and 1. Concomitant RvD1 and MaR1 treatment significantly mitigated early pulmonary inflammation and lung IR injury in WT mice, which was regulated via FPR2 and LGR6 receptors. In the murine orthotopic donation after cardiac death LTx model, RvD1 and MaR1 treatments significantly attenuated lung IR injury and increased PaO2 levels compared to saline-treated controls. Mechanistically, RvD1/FPR2 signaling on alveolar macrophages attenuated HMGB1 and TNF-α secretion and upregulated uptake of macrophage-dependent apoptotic neutrophils (efferocytosis), whereas MaR1/LGR6 signaling mitigated CXCL1 secretion by epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Bioactive proresolving lipid mediator-dependent signaling that is, RvD1/FPR2 and MaR1/LGR6- offers a novel therapeutic strategy in post-LTx injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BAP31 regulates the expression of ICAM-1/VCAM-1 via MyD88/NF-κB pathway in acute lung injury mice model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549351/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; The cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that mediate neutrophil-endothelium cell adhesion are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). B-cell receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31) has been reported to engage in the expression of some CAMs. This study was undertaken to explore whether BAP31 in endotheliocyte affects the pathological process of ALI by regulating CAMs, and its possible mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; Our study used the shBAP31 endothelium cell lines and endothelial-specific BAP31 conditional knockdown mice constructed via Cre/loxP system. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the histopathological manifestations. The adhesion of neutrophils to vascular wall was examined by intravital microscopy. The nuclear translocation of NF-κB was observed by immunofluorescence staining assay. Flow cytometric, real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assay were performed to determine the expression of CAMs and key proteins in MyD88/NF-κB-related signaling pathway. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were analyzed for transcriptional activity of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; Mechanistic investigations indicated that endothelium-specific BAP31 depletion dramatically reduced the capacity of neutrophils adherence to endothelial cells (ECs), which was mainly attributed to the significant downregulation of ICAM-1 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and VCAM-1 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) expression. Interestingly, BAP31 knockdown apparently deactivated MyD88/TRAF6-mediated TAK1/NF-κB and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades, resulting in the inhibition of NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; Our data furnished convincing evidence that BAP31 deficiency performs a mitigative effect on ALI by decreasing neutrophils-ECs adhesion. These findings identified BAP31 as a promising protein for regulating the pathogenesis process of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PI3K/AKT-mediated autophagy inhibition facilitates mast cell activation to enhance severe inflammatory lung injury in influenza A virus- and secondary Staphylococcus aureus-infected mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549394/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality each year globally, and secondary bacterial infection further exacerbates the severity and fatality of the initial viral infection. Mast cells have substantial roles in protecting the respiratory tract mucosa, while their role in viral and bacterial co-infection remains unclear. The present study revealed that secondary Staphylococcus aureus infection significantly aggravated the activation of mast cells during the initial H1N1 infection both in vivo and in vitro, which was closely related to the increased inflammatory lung injury and mortality. Meanwhile, the secondary S. aureus infection suppressed autophagy and promoted inflammatory mediators released by mast cells through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Blocking PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation, could rescue autophagy and inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, based on the influenza A viral and secondary bacterial infected mice model, we showed that the combination of LY294002 and antiviral drug oseltamivir could effectively reduce the inflammatory damage and pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing in lungs, recovering body weight loss and improving the survival rate from the co-infections. In conclusion, secondary bacterial infection can inhibit autophagy and stimulate mast cell activation through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which might explain why secondary bacterial infection would cause severe and fatal consequences following an initial influenza A viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JCAD promotes arterial thrombosis through PI3K/Akt modulation: a translational study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36469488/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Variants of the junctional cadherin 5 associated (JCAD) locus associate with acute coronary syndromes. JCAD promotes experimental atherosclerosis through the large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2)/Hippo pathway. This study investigates the role of JCAD in arterial thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and results:&lt;/em&gt; JCAD knockout (&lt;em&gt;Jcad&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice underwent photochemically induced endothelial injury to trigger arterial thrombosis. Primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) treated with JCAD small interfering RNA (&lt;em&gt;siJCAD&lt;/em&gt;), LATS2 small interfering RNA (&lt;em&gt;siLATS2&lt;/em&gt;) or control siRNA (siSCR) were employed for in vitro assays. Plasma JCAD was measured in patients with chronic coronary syndrome or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). &lt;em&gt;Jcad&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice displayed reduced thrombogenicity as reflected by delayed time to carotid occlusion. Mechanisms include reduced activation of the coagulation cascade [reduced tissue factor (TF) expression and activity] and increased fibrinolysis [higher thrombus embolization episodes and D-dimer levels, reduced vascular plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 expression]. In vitro, JCAD silencing inhibited TF and PAI-1 expression in HAECs. JCAD-silenced HAECs (&lt;em&gt;siJCAD&lt;/em&gt;) displayed increased levels of LATS2 kinase. Yet, double JCAD and LATS2 silencing did not restore the control phenotype. &lt;em&gt;si-JCAD&lt;/em&gt; HAECs showed increased levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/proteinkinase B (Akt) activation, known to downregulate procoagulant expression. The PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor-wortmannin-prevented the effect of JCAD silencing on TF and PAI-1, indicating a causative role. Also, co-immunoprecipitation unveiled a direct interaction between JCAD and Akt. Confirming in vitro findings, PI3K/Akt and P-yes-associated protein levels were higher in &lt;em&gt;Jcad&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; animals. Lastly, as compared with chronic coronary syndrome, STEMI patients showed higher plasma JCAD, which notably correlated positively with both TF and PAI-1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JMJD3 Is Required for Acute Pancreatitis and Pancreatitis-Associated Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be complicated by inflammatory disorders of remote organs, such as lung injury, in which Jumonji domain-containing protein 3 (JMJD3) plays a vital role in proinflammatory responses. Currently, we found that JMJD3 expression was upregulated in the pancreas and lung in an AP male mouse model, which was also confirmed in AP patients. Further experiments revealed that the upregulation of JMJD3 and proinflammatory effects were possibly exerted by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or oxidized-mtDNA from tissue injury caused by AP. The release of mtDNA and oxidized-mtDNA contributed to the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes in lung injury through the stimulator of IFN genes (STING)/TLR9-NF-κB-JMJD3-TNF-α pathway. The inhibition of JMJD3 or utilization of Jmjd3-cKO mice significantly alleviated pulmonary inflammation induced by AP. Blocking mtDNA oxidation or knocking down the TLR9/STING pathway effectively alleviated inflammation. Therefore, inhibition of JMJD3 or STING/TLR9 pathway blockage might be a potential therapeutic strategy to treat AP and the associated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attenuation of the Severity of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by Pomiferin through Blocking Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in an AKT/Foxo1 Pathway-Dependent Manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36471865/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) gives rise to uncontrolled inflammatory response and oxidative stress, causing very high mortality globally. Pomiferin is a kind of prenylated isoflavonoid extracted from &lt;em&gt;Maclura pomifera&lt;/em&gt;, owning anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the functions and possible mechanisms of pomiferin in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ARDS remain unknown. C57BL/6 mice were injected with LPS (5 mg/kg) intratracheally to induce an in vivo ARDS model while RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) to induce an in vitro model. Our data demonstrated that pomiferin (20 mg/kg) significantly improved pulmonary function and lung pathological injury in mice with ARDS, apart from increasing survival rate. Meanwhile, pomiferin treatment also inhibited LPS-induced inflammation as well as oxidative stress in lung tissues. LPS stimulation significantly activated AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway in lung tissues, which could be reversed after pomiferin treatment. In vitro experiments further showed that 10, 20, and 50 μM of pomiferin could enhance cell viability of RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with LPS. What is more, 3-deoxysappanchalcone (3-DE), one AKT agonist, was used to active AKT in RAW264.7 macrophages. The results further showed that 3-DE could abolish pomiferin-elicited protection in LPS-treated RAW264.7 macrophages, evidenced by activated inflammation and oxidative stress. Taken together, our study showed that pomiferin could exert an ARDS-protective effect by blocking the AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway to inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative injury, which may serve as a potential candidate for the treatment of ARDS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathway analysis is a key analytical stage in the interpretation of omics data, providing a powerful method for detecting alterations in cellular processes. We recently developed a sensitive and distribution-free statistical framework for multisample distribution testing, which we implement here in the open-source R package single-cell pathway analysis (SCPA). We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCPA over commonly used methods, generate a scRNA-seq T cell dataset, and characterize pathway activity over early cellular activation. This reveals regulatory pathways in T cells, including an intrinsic type I interferon system regulating T cell survival and a reliance on arachidonic acid metabolism throughout T cell activation. A systems-level characterization of pathway activity in T cells across multiple tissues also identifies alpha-defensin expression as a hallmark of bone-marrow-derived T cells. Overall, this work provides a widely applicable tool for single-cell pathway analysis and highlights regulatory mechanisms of T cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1,2,3,4,6-O-Pentagalloylglucose Protects against Acute Lung Injury by Activating the AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 Pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious lung disease with a high mortality rate, warranting the development of novel therapies. Previously, we reported that 1,2,3,4,6-O-pentagalloylglucose (PGG) could afford protection against ALI, however, the PGG-mediated protective effects remain elusive. Herein, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) markedly inhibited the lung wet/drug weight ratio and attenuated histological changes in the lungs (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). A pretreatment with PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) reduced the number of total leukocytes and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) also attenuated oxidative stress by reducing the formation of formation and the depletion of superoxide dismutase to treat an ALI (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). To further explore the PGG-induced mechanism against an ALI, we screened the PGG pathway using immunohistochemical analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and Western blotting (WB). WB revealed that the expression levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (p-AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B phosphorylation (P-Akt), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) were significantly higher in the PGG group (60 and 30 mg/kg) than in the lipopolysaccharide group (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05); these findings were confirmed by the immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence results. Accordingly, PGG could be effective against an ALI by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress via AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling, allowing for the potential development of this as a natural drug against an ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uterine macrophages as treatment targets for therapy of premature rupture of membranes by modified ADSC-EVs through a circRNA/miRNA/NF-κB pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36402996/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Circular RNA (circRNA) is a type of stable non-coding RNA that modifies macrophage inflammation by sponging micro RNAs (miRNAs), binding to RNA-binding proteins, and undergoing translation into peptides. Activated M1 phenotype macrophages secrete matrix metalloproteinases to participate in softening of the cervix uteri to promote vaginal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the premature rupture of membranes (PROM) mouse model was used to analyze the role of macrophages in this process. Profiling of circRNAs was performed using a competing endogenous RNA microarray, and their functions were elucidated in vitro. Meanwhile, adipose tissue-derived stem cell-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) were applied as a vehicle to transport small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the circRNAs to demonstrate their biological function in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The miRNA &lt;em&gt;miR-1931&lt;/em&gt; is dependent on the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway but negatively regulates its activation by targeting the NF-κB signaling transducer TRAF6 to prevent polarization of M1 macrophages and inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion. The host gene of circRNA &lt;em&gt;B4GALNT1&lt;/em&gt;, also an NF-κB pathway-dependent gene, circularizes to form &lt;em&gt;circRNA_0002047&lt;/em&gt;, which sponges &lt;em&gt;miR-1931&lt;/em&gt; to maintain NF-κB pathway activation and MMP secretion in vitro. In the PROM model, EVs loaded with siRNAs targeting circRNAs demonstrated that the circRNAs reduced &lt;em&gt;miR-1931&lt;/em&gt; expression to maintain NF-κB pathway activation and MMP secretion for accelerating PROM in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our data provide insights into understanding PROM pathogenesis and improving PROM treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viral infection induces acute blood glucose decline in rodents that activates AMPK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMPK directly phosphorylates TBK1 at S511 to prime antiviral sensing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMPK-TBK1 couples glucose deficiency sensing and innate immune surveillance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting the AMPK-TBK1 axis compromises innate antiviral immunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutrient sensing and damage sensing are two fundamental processes in living organisms. While hyperglycemia is frequently linked to diabetes-related vulnerability to microbial infection, how body glucose levels affect innate immune responses to microbial invasion is not fully understood. Here, we surprisingly found that viral infection led to a rapid and dramatic decrease in blood glucose levels in rodents, leading to robust AMPK activation. AMPK, once activated, directly phosphorylates TBK1 at S511, which triggers IRF3 recruitment and the assembly of MAVS or STING signalosomes. Consistently, ablation or inhibition of AMPK, knockin of TBK1-S511A, or increased glucose levels compromised nucleic acid sensing, while boosting AMPK-TBK1 cascade by AICAR or TBK1-S511E knockin improves antiviral immunity substantially in various animal models. Thus, we identify TBK1 as an AMPK substrate, reveal the molecular mechanism coupling a dual sensing of glucose and nuclei acids, and report its physiological necessity in antiviral defense.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astaxanthin ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via inhibition of inflammatory reactions and modulation of the SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36278420/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a systemic inflammatory process. A large number of studies have shown that astaxanthin (ASTA) has strong anti-inflammatory effects and almost non-toxic side effects. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of ASTA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice and its underlying mechanism. The result showed that compared with the LPS group, the expression levels of the respiratory resistance (Re), inspiratory resistance (Ri), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio, albumin (BA/SA) ratio and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the ASTA pretreatment group were significantly reduced, and total cell, neutrophil and macrophage counts were significantly decreased. HE staining results showed that alveolar interstitial edema, bleeding and erythrocyte exudation were reduced. Compared with the LPS group, the percentage of Th17 cells and the content of interleukin (IL)-17 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the ASTA pretreatment group were significantly decreased, while the content of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and the percentage of Treg cells were significantly increased. Western blot analysis showed that ASTA could up-regulate the expression level of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) and down-regulate the expression levels of phosphorylated Janus kinase 2 (p-JAK2), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) in lung tissue. The results showed that ASTA had a protective effect on LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, and its protective mechanism was through activating the SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting Treg cell differentiation and reducing inflammatory reactions and Th17 cell differentiation, which provided a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tegument protein UL21 of alpha-herpesvirus inhibits the innate immunity by triggering CGAS degradation through TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36343628/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha-herpesvirus causes lifelong infections and serious diseases in a wide range of hosts and has developed multiple strategies to counteract the host defense. Here, we demonstrate that the tegument protein UL21 (unique long region 21) in pseudorabies virus (PRV) dampens type I interferon signaling by triggering the degradation of CGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) through the macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosome pathway. Mechanistically, the UL21 protein scaffolds the E3 ligase UBE3C (ubiquitin protein ligase E3C) to catalyze the K27-linked ubiquitination of CGAS at Lys384, which is recognized by the cargo receptor TOLLIP (toll interacting protein) and degraded in the lysosome. Additionally, we show that the N terminus of UL21 in PRV is dominant in destabilizing CGAS-mediated innate immunity. Moreover, viral tegument protein UL21 in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) also displays the conserved inhibitory mechanisms. Furthermore, by using PRV, we demonstrate the roles of UL21 in degrading CGAS to promote viral infection in vivo. Altogether, these findings describe a distinct pathway where alpha-herpesvirus exploits TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagy to evade host antiviral immunity, highlighting a new interface of interplay between the host and DNA virus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulate matter (PM) is a major environmental contaminant that causes and worsens respiratory diseases. Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10), a paracrine fibroblast growth factor that specifically stimulates repair and regeneration after injury, has been shown to protect against PM-induced lung injury. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, the protective effects of FGF10 were investigated using a PM-induced lung injury mouse model in vivo and BEAS-2B cells in vitro. According to the findings, FGF10 treatment alleviated PM-induced oxidative damage and pyroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, FGF10 activated antioxidative Nrf2 signaling. Inhibition of PI3K signaling with LY294002 or Nrf2 signaling with ML385 revealed that FGF10-mediated lung protection was mediated by the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. These results collectively indicate that FGF10 inhibits oxidative stress-mediated pyroptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway, suggesting a possible therapy for PM-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and objective:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease which has high mortality and lacks effective pharmacological treatments. Excessive inflammation and oxidative stress are the key pathogenesis of ALI. Mefunidone (MFD), a novel small molecule compound, displayed anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress effects on streptozocin (STZ) and db/db mice in our previous studies. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of MFD on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and explore the potential molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the effects of MFD on LPS-induced ALI mouse model and LPS-stimulated immortalized mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MFD could alleviate pulmonary structure disorder and attenuate pulmonary neutrophils infiltration induced by LPS. MFD could also decreased proinflammatory cytokines release and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation stimulated by LPS. Further, MFD could significantly reduce LPS-induced phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), increase expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and restore the expressions of antioxidant enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results firstly supported that MFD effectively protected LPS-induced ALI against inflammation and oxidative stress through inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway and activating Nrf2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Naringenin attenuates inflammation, apoptosis, and ferroptosis in silver nanoparticle-induced lung injury through a mechanism associated with Nrf2/HO-1 axis: In vitro and in vivo studies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36306867/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the wide application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), their potential damage to human health needs to be investigated. Lung is one of the main target organs after inhalation of AgNPs. Naringenin has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of naringenin against AgNPs-induced lung injury and determine the underlying mechanism. In in vivo experiments, AgNPs were intratracheally instilled into ICR mice (l mg/kg) to establish a lung injury model. These mice were then treated with naringenin by oral gavage (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) for three days. Naringenin treatment decreased the levels of white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in the blood, ameliorated lung injury, suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, normalized ferroptotic markers and prevented oxidative stress with elevating Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expressions in lung. In in vitro experiments, BEAS-2B cells were firstly treated with AgNPs (320 μg/mL) and then naringenin (25, 50, and 100 μM), respectively. Naringenin attenuated AgNPs-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Moreover, naringenin attenuated AgNPs-induced apoptosis with modulated low BAX, CytC, cleaved Caspase9, cleaved Caspase3 but high Bcl2. Furthermore, naringenin effectively decreased ferroptotic markers and increased the protein expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1, as well as increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Importantly, the anti-apoptotic and anti-ferroptotic effects of naringenin in BEAS-2B cells were found to be at least partially Nrf2-dependent. These results indicated that naringenin exerted anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and anti-ferroptosis effects and protected against AgNPs-induced lung injury at least partly via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rhein ameliorates septic lung injury and intervenes in macrophage metabolic reprogramming in the inflammatory state by Sirtuin 1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36279970/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein prevented the progression of acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metabolism in sepsis pathological state was changed after Rhein treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein inhibited the over activation of macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein preconditioning up-regulated and activated SIRT1 signal pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is an organ dysfunction syndrome caused by the maladjustment of response to infection. Acute lung injury (ALI) appears the earliest, with urgent onset and limited treatments. Previous pharmacological studies have found that rhein (RH), an active ingredient rich in rhubarb, has multiple pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-infection and metabolic regulation. This research aimed to explore whether RH alleviates septic acute lung injury and probe possible mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the septic ALI mouse model was established by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). LPS-induced RAW264.7 model was selected to further explore the protective mechanism of RH. H&amp;amp;E staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR, and 1H NMR analysis were used to verify the protective effect of RH on ALI &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; RH could relieve pathological lung injury and pulmonary edema, reduce the serum LPS and inhibit inflammatory response in CLP mice. Further studies displayed that RH affected the metabolism &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, with significant changes in serum and lung metabolomics. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; results demonstrated that RH inhibited the expression of inflammatory mediators and factors in macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming and upregulating the expression of Sirtuin 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; RH improved the overall metabolic condition of sepsis mice by up-regulating and activating SIRT1, and inhibited the over activation of macrophages by regulating metabolism. These findings reveal the therapeutic mechanism of RH on sepsis ALI from the perspective of metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The influenza virus PB2 protein evades antiviral innate immunity by inhibiting JAK1/STAT signalling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36271046/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) polymerase protein PB2 has been shown to partially inhibit the host immune response by blocking the induction of interferons (IFNs). However, the IAV PB2 protein that regulates the downstream signaling pathway of IFNs is not well characterized. Here, we report that IAV PB2 protein reduces cellular sensitivity to IFNs, suppressing the activation of STAT1/STAT2 and ISGs. Furthermore, IAV PB2 protein targets mammalian JAK1 at lysine 859 and 860 for ubiquitination and degradation. Notably, the H5 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus with I283M/K526R mutations on PB2 increases the ability to degrade mammalian JAK1 and exhibits higher replicate efficiency in mammalian (but not avian) cells and mouse lung tissues, and causes greater mortality in infected mice. Altogether, these data describe a negative regulatory mechanism involving PB2-JAK1 and provide insights into an evasion strategy from host antiviral immunity employed by IAV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BP5 alleviates endotoxemia-induced acute lung injury by activating Nrf2 via dual regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and the Akt (Ser473)/GSK3β (Ser9)/Fyn pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress and inflammation play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). Previously, pentapeptide bursopentin (BP5, Cys-Lys-Arg-Val-Tyr) was reported to possess significant antioxidant activity and inhibit lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced NF-κB activation in vitro, whereas little is known about its effects in vivo. In this study, we explored the effects of BP5 on endotoxemia-induced ALI in mice and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our studies revealed that BP5 markedly improved survival and effectively alleviated lung injury by reducing overoxidation and excessive inflammatory response in endotoxemia mice. In LPS-stimulated mouse primary macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells, BP5 also exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties by enhancing Nrf2 activation. Importantly, these beneficial effects were abolished by Nrf2 knockdown. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we performed localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) assays, molecular docking, together with cell-based studies, and found that BP5 inhibited the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction to promote Nrf2 nuclear translocation and activation. Moreover, BP5-induced Nrf2 activation was shown to be accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt (at Ser473) and GSK3β (at Ser9), and a decrease in Fyn nuclear accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacologically inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β obviously enhanced Fyn nuclear accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells, which partially attenuated the promoting effect of BP5 on Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and activation. Furthermore, In Nrf2-/- mice, the protective effects of BP5 on the endotoxemia-induced ALI in WT mice were largely vanished. Our findings indicated that BP5 effectively protected endotoxemia-induced ALI against oxidative stress and inflammatory response, which are largely dependent on activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Underlying mechanisms include dual regulation of the Keap-Nrf2 interaction and the Akt (Ser473)/GSK3β (Ser9)/Fyn pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of environmental factors that promote intestinal inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36266581/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide association studies have identified risk loci linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-a complex chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. The increasing prevalence of IBD in industrialized countries and the augmented disease risk observed in migrants who move into areas of higher disease prevalence suggest that environmental factors are also important determinants of IBD susceptibility and severity. However, the identification of environmental factors relevant to IBD and the mechanisms by which they influence disease has been hampered by the lack of platforms for their systematic investigation. Here we describe an integrated systems approach, combining publicly available databases, zebrafish chemical screens, machine learning and mouse preclinical models to identify environmental factors that control intestinal inflammation. This approach established that the herbicide propyzamide increases inflammation in the small and large intestine. Moreover, we show that an AHR-NF-κB-C/EBPβ signalling axis operates in T cells and dendritic cells to promote intestinal inflammation, and is targeted by propyzamide. In conclusion, we developed a pipeline for the identification of environmental factors and mechanisms of pathogenesis in IBD and, potentially, other inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astaxanthin attenuates ferroptosis via Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways in LPS-induced acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin prevents against LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin attenuates ferroptosis against lps-induced acute lung injury by Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a form of regulated nonapoptotic cell death associated with iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Previous studies have shown that ferroptosis is involved in the occurrence and development of acute lung injury (ALI). In this study, a systems pharmacology approach was performed through the overall process of target acquisition, network construction, and further analysis. Then, the effects of astaxanthin on LPS-induced inflammation and ferroptosis were investigated in RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS in vitro and ALI mice induced by LPS in vivo. The enrichment analysis of astaxanthin-target gene is closely related to the occurrence and development mechanism of ferroptosis. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of astaxanthin acting on ALI found that these intersection genes are associated with ALI inflammatory pathway. In addition, astaxanthin can effectively inhibit LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ferroptosis in RAW264.7 cells. Consistently, administration of astaxanthin protected mice against LPS-induced ALI and significantly decreased the extent of lung edema, inflammatory cells infiltration, and ferroptosis in vivo, and Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is involved in astaxanthin inhibits LPS-induced ALI and ferroptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that astaxanthin inhibit inflammation and ferroptosis by regulating Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to reduce LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Overproduction of endothelial extracellular vesicles (eEVs) is correlated with pulmonary hypertension progression, but the precise mechanism remains largely unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; MicroRNA-chip and real-time polymerase chain reaction were conducted to screen and validate microRNA profiles in blood plasma eEVs of rats and human with or without cigarette smoking. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were cultured to study signaling pathways. Pulmonary hypertension phenotypes were evaluated in wild-type and calcium-sensing receptor knockout rats to identify the pathophysiological significance of the microRNA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MicroR-1249 was predominant highly expressed in eEVs from plasma of rats exposed to cigarette smoking, and confirmed in eEVs from plasma of human smokers as well as in eEVs from cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery endothelial cells, but not in cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. In cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, microR-1249 downregulated the expression of histone deacetylase 10, which in turn enhanced the acetylated form of NFκB (nuclear factor κB) level and its nuclear translocation leading to increased expression of calcium-sensing receptor. In rats, the repression of microR-1249 in eEVs by microR-1249 inhibitor, histone deacetylase 10 overexpression, or calcium-sensing receptor knockout profoundly inhibited the proliferative capacities and diminished apoptosis-resistance of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and pulmonary hypertension development in rats intravenously administrated with eEVs preparation from cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Cigarette smoke-enriched microR-1249 in endothelial extracellular vesicles facilitates the hyperproliferative and antiapoptotic status of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells promoting pulmonary hypertension evolution through the inhibition of histone deacetylase 10-NFκB-calcium-sensing receptor cascade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schisandrin B protects against LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury by targeting MyD88</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36270224/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36270224/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a challenging clinical syndrome that manifests as an acute inflammatory response. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a bioactive lignan from Schisandra genus plants, has been shown to suppress inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypothesis/purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study performed an in-depth investigation of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Sch B in macrophages and in an animal model of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; qPCR array was used to probe the differential effects and potential target of Sch B. ALI was induced by intratracheal administration of LPS in experimental mice with or without Sch B treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our studies show that Sch B differentially modulates inflammatory factor induction by LPS in macrophages by directly binding myeloid differentiation response factor-88 (MyD88), an essential adaptor protein in the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) pathway. Sch B spares non-MyD88-pathways downstream of TLR4. Such inhibition suppressed key signaling mediators such as TAK1, MAPKs, and NF-κB, and pro-inflammatory factor induction. Pull down assay using biotinylated-Sch B validate the direct interaction between Sch B and MyD88 in macrophages. Treatment of mice with Sch B prior to LPS challenge reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in lungs, induction of MyD88-pathway signaling proteins, and prevented inflammatory cytokine induction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, our studies have identified MyD88 as a direct target of Sch B for its anti-inflammatory activity, and suggest that Sch B may have therapeutic value for acute lung injury and other MyD88-dependent inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The signaling molecule stimulator of IFN genes (STING) was identified as a crucial regulator of the DNA-sensing cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway, and this signaling pathway regulates inflammation and energy homeostasis under conditions of obesity, kidney fibrosis, and AKI. However, the role of STING in causing CKD, including diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and Alport syndrome, is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate whether STING activation contributes to the development and progression of glomerular diseases such as DKD and Alport syndrome, immortalized human and murine podocytes were differentiated for 14 days and treated with a STING-specific agonist. We used diabetic db/db mice, mice with experimental Alport syndrome, C57BL/6 mice, and STING knockout mice to assess the role of the STING signaling pathway in kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, murine and human podocytes express all of the components of the cGAS-STING pathway. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, activation of STING renders C57BL/6 mice susceptible to albuminuria and podocyte loss. STING is activated at baseline in mice with experimental DKD and Alport syndrome. STING activation occurs in the glomerular but not the tubulointerstitial compartment in association with autophagic podocyte death in Alport syndrome mice and with apoptotic podocyte death in DKD mouse models. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of STING protects from progression of kidney disease in mice with DKD and Alport syndrome and increases lifespan in Alport syndrome mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The activation of the STING pathway acts as a mediator of disease progression in DKD and Alport syndrome. Targeting STING may offer a therapeutic option to treat glomerular diseases of metabolic and nonmetabolic origin or prevent their development, progression, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hedgehog pathway and its inhibitors in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36191777/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COPD affects millions of people and is now ranked as the third leading cause of death worldwide. This largely untreatable chronic airway disease results in irreversible destruction of lung architecture. The small lung hypothesis is now supported by epidemiological, physiological and clinical studies. Accordingly, the early and severe COPD phenotype carries the most dreadful prognosis and finds its roots during lung growth. Pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood and implicate individual susceptibility (genetics), a large part of environmental factors (viral infections, tobacco consumption, air pollution) and the combined effects of those triggers on gene expression. Genetic susceptibility is most likely involved as the disease is severe and starts early in life. The latter observation led to the identification of Mendelian inheritance via disease-causing variants of SERPINA1 - known as the basis for alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and TERT. In the last two decades multiple genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with COPD. High significance SNPs are located in 4q31 near HHIP which encodes an evolutionarily highly conserved physiological inhibitor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (HH). HHIP is critical to several in utero developmental lung processes. It is also implicated in homeostasis, injury response, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor resistance to apoptosis. A few studies have reported decreased HHIP RNA and protein levels in human adult COPD lungs. HHIP+/- murine models led to emphysema. HH pathway inhibitors, such as vismodegib and sonidegib, are already validated in oncology, whereas other drugs have evidenced in vitro effects. Targeting the Hedgehog pathway could lead to a new therapeutic avenue in COPD. In this review, we focused on the early and severe COPD phenotype and the small lung hypothesis by exploring genetic susceptibility traits that are potentially treatable, thus summarizing promising therapeutics for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanisms of Biochanin A Alleviating PM2.5 Organic Extracts-Induced EMT of A549 Cells through the PI3K/Akt Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36181478/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important step in tumor progression, which enables tumor cells to acquire migration and invasion characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of biological biochanin A (BCA) in ameliorating fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) lung injury. The results showed that PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; could induce spindle-like changes in cell morphology, causing the ability of migration and invasion. However, they were significantly inhibited by BCA treatment (10/20/30 μm). After BCA treatment, the release and transcription of chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor gene CXCR4 were inhibited, and the release of growth inducer TGF-β1 was significantly reduced. In addition, BCA promoted the transcription of E-cadherin and β-catenin, inhibiting the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin, and down-regulated the expression of MMP-2/9. We found that BCA effectively interfered with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activated by PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;. In conclusion, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; can induce EMT in lung cancer cells, and BCA may reverse this process by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-9a-5p alleviates ventilator-induced lung injury in rats by inhibiting the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway via CXCR4 expression downregulation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36193608/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I establishment of (ventilator-induced acute lung injury) VILI rat model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used bioinformatics software to predict the target gene of miR-9a-5p, and verified the conclusion through double Luciferase Report experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) through lavage fluid recovery technology for experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Globally, Mechanical ventilation is the most commonly used short-term life support technology. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is an inflammatory injury caused by mechanical ventilation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as new gene regulators that play an important role in lung injury and inflammation. However, the role and mechanism of action of miR-9a-5p in VILI remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Herein, a rat model of VILI was established. To determine the expression levels of miR-9a-5p and CXCR4 mRNA, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were conducted. As well as western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence analyses, we determined the expression of CXCR4, SDF-1 and MAPK signaling pathway-related kinases. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining and the wet-dry ratio of the lung tissue were used to evaluate organ injury. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity measurements were performed to evaluate the inflammatory response. In addition, double luciferase reporter assays were used to verify the association between miR-9a-5p and CXCR4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The expression of miR-9a-5p was low, whereas that of CXCR4 was high in the lung tissues of VILI rats. The overexpression of miR-9a-5p alleviated the degree of pathological injury in the lung tissues of rats with VILI, downregulating inflammatory cytokine expression and MPO activity. In the VILI rat model, miR-9a-5p targeted the negative regulation of CXCR4, and CXCR4 overexpression to reverse the lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of miR-9a-5p overexpression in VILI rats. miR-9a-5p also inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal receptor-activated kinase (ERK), a protein related to the MAPK signaling pathway, by downregulating CXCR4 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; miR-9a-5p can hinder the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and reduce inflammatory reactions and lung injury in VILI rats through the targeted regulation of CXCR4 expression. Therefore, miR-9a-5p could serve as an intervention target to supply a new strategy for the care of VILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Serine metabolism orchestrates macrophage polarization by regulating the IGF1-p38 axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36180780/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serine metabolism is reportedly involved in immune cell functions, but whether and how serine metabolism regulates macrophage polarization remain largely unknown. Here, we show that suppressing serine metabolism, either by inhibiting the activity of the key enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase in the serine biosynthesis pathway or by exogenous serine and glycine restriction, robustly enhances the polarization of interferon-γ-activated macrophages (M(IFN-γ)) but suppresses that of interleukin-4-activated macrophages (M(IL-4)) both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, serine metabolism deficiency increases the expression of IGF1 by reducing the promoter abundance of S-adenosyl methionine-dependent histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. IGF1 then activates the p38-dependent JAK-STAT1 axis to promote M(IFN-γ) polarization and suppress STAT6-mediated M(IL-4) activation. This study reveals a new mechanism by which serine metabolism orchestrates macrophage polarization and suggests the manipulation of serine metabolism as a therapeutic strategy for macrophage-mediated immune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lycopene attenuates the inflammation and apoptosis in aristolochic acid nephropathy by targeting the Nrf2 antioxidant system</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36198206/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene improves renal dysfunction in mice with aristolochic acid nephropathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene inhibits oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the kidney of mice with aristolochic acid nephropathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway is critical to inhibit the development of renal inflammatory response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene activates the Nrf2 antioxidant system and then inhibits apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lycopene (LYC) is a carotenoid, has antioxidant properties. This study investigated whether lycopene attenuates aristolochic acids (AAs) -induced chronic kidney disease. In this experiment, lycopene was used to intervene C57BL/6 mice with renal injury induced by aristolochic acid exposure. The histomorphological changes and serological parameters of the kidney were measured in order to assess the alleviating effect of lycopene on renal injury in aristolochic acid nephropathy. In vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to verify the main mechanism of action and drug targets of lycopene in improving aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) and by various experimental methods such as ELISA, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Western-blot and qRT-PCR. The results showed that oxidative stress injury was induced in the kidney of mice after AAI exposure, resulting in inflammatory response and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. The results showed that the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway was inhibited after AAI exposure. AAI induces oxidative stress injury in the kidney, which ultimately leads to inflammation and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. After LYC intervened in the body, it activated Nrf2 nuclear translocation and its downstream HO-1 and NQO1 antioxidant signaling pathways. LYC inhibited ROS production by renal tubular epithelial cells, and alleviated mitochondrial damage. LYC further modulated the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling cascade, thereby reduced the accumulation of inflammatory factors in the renal interstitium. Moreover, LYC was able to up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2, down-regulate Bax expression and inhibit the activation of cleaved forms of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3, which finally attenuated the apoptosis of the mitochondrial pathway induced by AAI exposure. It was concluded that lycopene was able to activate the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway to maintain the homeostasis of renal oxidative stress and ultimately attenuated renal inflammatory response and apoptosis. These results suggested that lycopene can be used as a drug to relieve AAN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polysaccharides from &lt;em&gt;Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum&lt;/em&gt; Diels et Gilg (SYQP) attenuated LPS-induced ALI in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYQP exerted anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYQP alleviated ALI by inhibiting TLR4/COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum&lt;/em&gt; Diels et Gilg (Sanyeqing, SYQ), a traditional herb native to China, has been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, febrile convulsions and dysentery. Previous studies have demonstrated the hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects of polysaccharides from SYQ (SYQP). However, the role of SYQP in acute lung injury (ALI) remained unknown. Our present study aimed to explore the protective effects of SYQP in ALI and explained its underlying mechanism. In vivo, Balb/c mice were intragastrically administered with SYQP and dexamethasone (DXMS) for 14 days which were intratracheally instilled (IT) with LPS at the last day. In vitro, A549 cells were pretreated with SYQP, DXMS or TAK-242, following by LPS stimulation for 24 h. The histopathological results showed that SYQP remarkably alleviated pulmonary macrophage infiltration and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels. Additionally, SYQP evidently suppressed wet/dry (W/D) ratio of lung and white blood cells (WBC) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Moreover, SYQP markedly reduced TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and COX-2 levels both in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, SYQP significantly attenuated oxidative stress through upregulating the levels of SOD and GSH-Px and downregulating the expressions of MDA and LDH in vivo, which was confirmed by in vitro results that SYQP could increase SOD activity and decrease MDA and NO contents. Importantly, a decline in protein expressions of TLR4, COX-2, NF-κB p50, phospho-NF-κB p65 and phospho-IκB-α was detected in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our results demonstrated that SYQP ameliorated LPS-induced ALI by alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress via attenuating TLR4/COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiota-stem cell niche crosstalk: A new territory for maintaining intestinal homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/imt2.54/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are protected by their niche and are regulated by Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, and Notch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISCs and their relationship with intestinal microbiota provide a feasible pathway to alleviate intestinal diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diverse bacteria-related postbiotics regulate ISCs and maintain their homeostasis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intestinal epithelium undergoes rapid cellular turnover, relying on the local niche, to support intestinal stem cells (ISCs) function and self-renewal. Research into the association between ISCs and disease continues to expand at a rapid rate. However, the detailed interaction of ISCs and gut microbes remains to be elucidated. Thus, this review witnessed major advances in the crosstalk between ISCs and gut microbes, delivering key insights into (1) construction of ISC niche and molecular mechanism of how to jointly govern epithelial homeostasis and protect against intestinal diseases with the participation of Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, and Notch; (2) differentiation fate of ISCs affect the gut microbiota. Meanwhile, the presence of intestinal microbes also regulates ISC function; (3) microbiota regulation on ISCs by Wnt and Notch signals through pattern recognition receptors; (4) how do specific microbiota-related postbiotics influence ISCs to maintain intestinal epithelial regeneration and homeostasis that provide insights into a promising alternative therapeutic method for intestinal diseases. Considering the detailed interaction is still unclear, it is necessary to further explore the regulatory role of gut microbiota on ISCs to utilize microbes to alleviate gut disorders. Furthermore, these major advances collectively drive us ever closer to breakthroughs in regenerative medicine and cancer treatment by microbial transplantation in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-LAK cell-oriented protein kinase (TOPK) is a potential therapeutic target in tumors. However, its role in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been reported. Here, we found that TOPK was highly expressed in ALK-positive NSCLC. Additionally, ALK was identified as another upstream kinase of TOPK by in vitro kinase assay screening. Then, it was proven that ALK phosphorylated TOPK at Y74 in vitro and ex vivo, and the pathways downstream of ALK-TOPK were explored by phosphoproteomic analysis. Subsequently, we demonstrated that inhibiting TOPK enhanced tumor sensitivity to alectinib (an ALK inhibitor). The combination of alectinib and HI-032 (a TOPK inhibitor) suppressed the growth and promoted the apoptosis of ALK-positive NSCLC cells ex vivo and in vivo. Our findings reveal a novel ALK-TOPK signaling pathway in ALK-positive NSCLC. The combination of alectinib and HI-032 might be a promising therapeutic strategy for improving the sensitivity of ALK-positive NSCLC to targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to identify and prepare peptides from selenium (Se)-enriched soybeans and determine whether dietary Se-enriched soybean peptides (Se-SPep) could inhibit lung injury in mice induced by fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups. The mice in the prevention groups were pretreated with 378 mg kg-1 of Se-SPep, soybean peptides (SPep), and Se-enriched soybean protein (Se-SPro), respectively, for four weeks. The mice in the PM2.5 exposure group received concentrated PM2.5 (15 μg per day mice) for 1 h daily from the third week for two weeks. The results showed that the leukocyte and cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the PM2.5 exposure group were higher than those in the control group. Se-SPep pretreatment decreased the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels compared with the PM2.5 exposure group. Additionally, Se-SPep pretreatment inhibited TLR4/NF-κB/IκBα and NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 protein expression in the lungs. In conclusion, Se-SPep pretreatment may protect the lungs of the mice against PM2.5-induced inflammation, suggesting that Se-SPep represents a potential preventative agent to inhibit PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Hippo pathway and its correlation with acute kidney injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant clinical complication with a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality, for which therapeutic options remain limited. The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway implicated in cell proliferation, dedifferentiation, and apoptosis via phosphorylation and inactivation of its downstream effectors Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Recent studies have revealed that the Hippo pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and repair of AKI. The Hippo pathway can mediate renal dysfunction through modulation of mitochondrial apoptosis under AKI conditions. Transient activation of YAP/TAZ in the acute phase of AKI may benefit renal recovery and regeneration, whereas persistent activation of YAP/TAZ in severe AKI may lead to maladaptive repair and transition to chronic kidney disease. This review aims to summarize recent findings on the associations between the Hippo pathway and AKI and to identify new therapeutic targets and strategies for AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Na/K-ATPase suppresses LPS-induced pro-inflammatory signaling through Lyn</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1 interacts with TLR4 and SFKs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1 restricts LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice injected with LPS show more lung injury and lower survival rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na/K-ATPase (NKA), besides its ion transporter function, is a signal transducer by regulating Src family kinases (SFK). The signaling NKA contributes to oxidized LDL-induced macrophage foam cell formation and interacts with TLR4. However, its role in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced signaling and glycolytic switch in macrophages remains unclear. Using peritoneal macrophages from NKA α1 haploinsufficient mice (NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;), we found that NKA α1 haploinsufficiency led to enhanced LPS-stimulated NF-κB pathway, ROS signaling, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS resulted in more severe lung inflammation and injury with lower survival rate in NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Additionally, LPS induced a higher extent of the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Mechanistically, NKA α1 interacted with TLR4 and Lyn. The presence of NKA α1 in this complex attenuated Lyn activation by LPS, which subsequently restricted the downstream ROS and NF-κB signaling. In conclusion, we demonstrated that NKA α1 suppresses LPS-induced macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling through Lyn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rectal administration of butyrate ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis in mice through induction of hepatocyte growth factor in the colon via the HDAC-PPARγ pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36116532/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butyrate, given by oral administration or in drinking water, has been shown to improve experimental pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in mice despite of very low bioavailability. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics disconnection attracts us to explore its anti-PF mechanism in view of the intestinal expression of anti-PF factors. In bleomycin-induced PF in mice, rectal administration of butyrate (500 mg/kg) exhibited a significant anti-PF effect, with a maximum plasma concentration largely lower than the minimum effective concentration (1 mM) at which butyrate inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory factors by lung epithelial cells and the production of extracellular matrix by lung fibroblasts. The rectal administration of butyrate significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the colons of PF mice, but showed no significant effect on the mRNA expression of HGF in the small intestines, lungs and livers. In colon epithelial cells, the monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHC) abrogated butyrate-induced expression of HGF, indicating that butyrate functions through entering into cells. Butyrate showed no significant effect on the histone acetylation in the promoter region of HGF, suggesting that it promotes HGF expression not by directly affecting the histone deacetylation of HGF but by other pathways. GW9662, the inhibitor of PPARγ, significantly attenuated the effect of butyrate to promote the mRNA expression of HGF. Butyrate was able to enhance the acetylation of PPARγ, and a targeted mutation of lysine at the position 240 (K240) of PPARγ markedly diminished the induction of butyrate on HGF expression, suggesting that butyrate promoted HGF expression in colon epithelial cells by upregulating PPARγ K240 acetylation. In summary, rectal administration of butyrate promotes the expression of HGF in colonic epithelial cells through upregulating PPARγ acetylation via inhibition of HDAC activity. The findings of the present study provide a reasonable explanation for the anti-PF action mode of butyrate based on the &amp;rsquo;lung-gut axis&amp;rsquo;, and found that intestine-derived butyrate and HGF may be involved in the modulation of the occurrence and progression of PF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astragaloside IV regulates the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to inhibit PM2.5-mediated lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36115280/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5-induced lung injury was associated with the ferroptosis and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV pre-treatment attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury by inhibiting ferroptosis via Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV is a potential drug for prevention of PM2.5-induced respiratory disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Exposure to PM2.5 will increase the risk of respiratory disease and increase the burden of social health care. Astragaloside Ⅳ (Ast-IV) is one of the main biologically active substances form Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus, which owns various pharmacological effects. Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by accumulation of iron-dependent lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is not clear whether there are typical features of ferroptosis in PM2.5-induced lung injury. This study investigates whether PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice has a special form of ferroptosis and the specific protective mechanism of Ast-IV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjects and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Forty-two male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 7 per group): NS group (normal saline), Ast group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg), PM2.5 group, Ast-L group (Ast-IV 50 mg/kg + PM2.5), Ast-H group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + PM2.5) and Era group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + erastin 20 mg/kg + PM2.5). Mice were pre-treated with Ast-IV intraperitoneally for three days. Then, PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) was given by non-invasive tracheal instillation to induce lung injury. The ferroptosis&amp;rsquo; agonist erastin was used to verify the mechanism of Ast-IV anti-ferroptosis. 12 h after PM2.5 stimulation, the mice were euthanized. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum were collected for oxidative stress and cytokine determination. Lung tissues were collected for glutathione (GSH), tissue iron content, histology, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Ast-IV reduced the lung wet-dry ratio and the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in serum. Ast-IV could also improve the oxidative stress level in BALF, restore the GSH level in the lung tissue, and reduce the iron content in the lung tissue. Western blot outcomes revealed that Ast-IV regulated the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to protect PM2.5-mediated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The protective effect of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice might be related to the inhibition of ferroptosis in lung tissue. Anti-ferroptosis might be a new mechanism of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>D-tagatose protects against oleic acid-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in rats by activating PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36189316/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier, resulting in severe alveolar edema and inflammation. D-tagatose (TAG) is a low-calorie fructose isomer with diverse biological activities whose role in ARDS has never been explored. We found that TAG protects lung tissues from injury in the oleic acid-induced rat model of ARDS. Seventeen male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups: Sham (n = 5), ARDS (n = 6), and TAG + ARDS (n = 6). The treatment groups were injected with oleic acid to induce ARDS, and the TAG + ARDS group was given TAG 3 days before the induction. After the treatments, the effect of TAG was evaluated by blood gas analysis and observing the gross and histological structure of the lung. The results showed that TAG significantly improved the oxygenation function, reduced the respiratory acidosis and the inflammatory response. TAG also improved the vascular permeability in ARDS rats and promoted the differentiation of alveolar type II cells, maintaining the stability of the alveolar structure. This protective effect of TAG on the lung may be achieved by activating the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, TAG protects against oleic acid-induced ARDS in rats, suggesting a new clinical strategy for treating the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial DNA mediates immunoparalysis of dendritic cells in sepsis via STING signalling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36106559/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a potent activator for pro-inflammatory response. Dendritic cells (DCs) are immunosuppressed in sepsis, whether mtDNA mediates immunoparalysis in sepsis remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The mRNAs were assessed by qPCR. Flow cytometry was used to measure the expression of costimulatory molecules and the proliferation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to analyse the expression of proteins. Cytokine secretion was detected by ELISA. Histology of lung tissue was used to assess the inflammatory injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia increased plasma mtDNA levels and immunoparalysis of spleen DCs, while hydrolysing mtDNA reversed immunoparalysis of spleen DCs in vivo. Moreover, cytoplasmic mtDNA of DCs was accumulated in endotoxemia and sepsis. mtDNA transfection into bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) inhibited the expression of costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD40, CD80 and CD86) and the release of IL-12p70, while increasing the secretion of IL-10. Cytoplasmic mtDNA also inhibited the ability of BMDCs to promote the proliferation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Mechanistic analysis revealed that STING signalling was required for mtDNA-mediated immunoparalysis of DCs in vivo and in vitro. Further studies showed deletion of STING reversed mtDNA-mediated immunoparalysis of DCs and improved the prognosis of endotoxemia and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results demonstrated that mtDNA promotes immunoparalysis of DCs, and contributes to sepsis-associated immunosuppression by activating STING signalling. Our study may provide new insights to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of immunosuppressive DCs in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin alleviates LPS-induced pulmonary injury and edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin protects against PMVECs hyperpermeability via preventing the loss of adherens junctions and tight junctions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress by regulating mitochondrial function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin attenuates PMVECs barrier dysfunction via activating the Epac1/AKT signaling axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) barrier dysfunction is a main pathophysiological feature of sepsis-related acute lung injury (ALI). This study aimed to investigate whether the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor linagliptin could protect against LPS-induced PMVECs barrier disruption and its underlying molecular mechanisms. A classical ALI animal model and LPS-treated PMVECs were applied and all were treated with or without linagliptin. Cellular experiments demonstrated that linagliptin could mitigate LPS-induced PMVECs hyperpermeability and intercellular junction (VE-cadherin, β-catenin, and ZO-1) disruption in a dose-dependent manner. Correspondingly, it was observed that linagliptin pretreatment distinctly relieved LPS-induced lung injury, oxidative stress, and pulmonary edema in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of oxidative stress by linagliptin may be achieved by reversing impaired mitochondrial function. Mechanistically, linagliptin administration promoted the activation of the Epac1 pathway and its downstream AKT pathway, while inhibition of the Epac1/Akt signaling pathway significantly alleviated the above-mentioned protective effect of linagliptin on the PMVECs barrier. Taken together, these data suggest that linagliptin can effectively reserve PMVECs barrier dysfunction and inhibit oxidative stress to protect against ALI via activating the Epac1/AKT signaling pathway, and thus may become a potential clinical therapeutic strategy for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to regenerate injured alveoli functionally and promptly causes a high incidence of fatality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). How elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) regulates the lineage of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells for re-alveolarization has not been studied. This study aimed to examine the role of PAI-1-Wnt5a-β catenin cascades in AT2 fate. Dramatic reduction in AT2 yield was observed in &lt;em&gt;Serpine1&lt;sup&gt;Tg&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Elevated PAI-1 level suppressed organoid number, development efficiency, and total surface area in vitro. Anti-PAI-1 neutralizing antibody restored organoid number, proliferation and differentiation of AT2 cells, and β-catenin level in organoids. Both Wnt family member 5A (Wnt5a) and Wnt5a-derived N-butyloxycarbonyl hexapeptide (Box5) altered the lineage of AT2 cells. This study demonstrates that elevated PAI-1 regulates AT2 proliferation and differentiation via the Wnt5a/β catenin cascades. PAI-1 could serve as autocrine signaling for lung injury repair.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation and oxidative stress caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increase the incidence and mortality rates of respiratory disorders. Rosavin is the main chemical component of Rhodiola plants, which exerts anti-oxidative and antiinflammatory effects. In this research, the potential therapeutic effect of rosavin was investigated by the PM2.5-induced lung injury rat model. Rats were instilled with PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) suspension intratracheally, while rosavin (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) was delivered by intraperitoneal injection before the PM2.5 injection. It was observed that rosavin could prevent lung injury caused by PM2.5. PM2.5 showed obvious ferroptosis-related ultrastructural alterations, which were significantly corrected by rosavin. The pretreatment with rosavin downregulated the levels of tissue iron, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal, and increased the levels of glutathione. The expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was upregulated by rosavin, together with other ferroptosis-related proteins. RSL3, a specific ferroptosis agonist, reversed the beneficial impact of rosavin. The network pharmacology approach predicted the activation of rosavin on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. LY294002, a potent PI3K inhibitor, decreased the upregulation of Nrf2 induced by rosavin. In conclusion, rosavin prevented lung injury induced by PM2.5 stimulation and suppressed ferroptosis via upregulating PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>H1N1 influenza virus dose dependent induction of dysregulated innate immune responses and STAT1/3 activation are associated with pulmonary immunopathological damage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infection poses a substantial challenge and causes high morbidity and mortality. Exacerbated pulmonary inflammatory responses are the major causes of extensive diffuse alveolar immunopathological damage. However, the relationship between the extent of cytokine storm, neutrophils/macrophages infiltration, and different IAV infection dose and time still needs to be further elucidated, and it is still unclear whether the signal transduction and transcriptional activator 1/3 (STAT1/3) signalling pathway plays a beneficial or detrimental role. Here, we established a mouse model of high- and low-dose pH1N1 infection. We found that pH1N1 infection induced robust and early pathological damage and cytokine storm in an infection dose- and time-dependent manner. High-dose pH1N1 infection induced massive and sustained recruitment of neutrophils as well as a higher ratio of M1:M2, which may contribute to severe lung immunopathological damage. pH1N1 infection activated dose- and time-dependent STAT1 and STAT3. Inhibition of STAT1 and/or STAT3 aggravated low-dose pH1N1 infection, induced lung damage, and decreased survival rate. Appropriate activation of STAT1/3 provided survival benefits and pathological improvement during low-dose pH1N1 infection. These results demonstrate that high-dose pH1N1 infection induces robust and sustained neutrophil infiltration, imbalanced macrophage polarization, excessive and earlier cytokine storm, and STAT1/3 activation, which are associated with pulmonary dysregulated proinflammatory responses and progress of acute lung injury. The severe innate immune responses may be the threshold at which protective functions give way to immunopathology, and assessing the magnitude of host innate immune responses is necessary in adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy for alleviating influenza-induced pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulator of calcineurin 1 deletion attenuates mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in acute kidney injury through JNK/Mff signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36071051/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced acute kidney injury (AKI), characterized by excessive mitochondrial damage and cell apoptosis, remains a clinical challenge. Recent studies suggest that regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) regulates mitochondrial function in different cell types, but the underlying mechanisms require further investigation. Herein, we aim to explore whether RCAN1 involves in mitochondrial dysfunction in AKI and the exact mechanism. In present study, AKI was induced by I/R and cisplatin in RCAN1flox/flox mice and mice with renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs)-specific deletion of RCAN1. The role of RCAN1 in hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) and cisplatin-induced injury in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2 was also examined by overexpression and knockdown of RCAN1. Mitochondrial function was assessed by transmission electron microscopy, JC-1 staining, MitoSOX staining, ATP production, mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay, Annexin V-FITC staining and Western blotting analysis of apoptosis-related proteins. It was found that protein expression of RCAN1 was markedly upregulated in I/R- or cisplatin-induced AKI mouse models, as well as in HR models in HK-2 cells. RCAN1 deficiency significantly reduced kidney damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell apoptosis, whereas RCAN1 overexpression led to the opposite phenotypes. Our in-depth mechanistic exploration demonstrated that RCAN1 increases the phosphorylation of mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) by binding to downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), then promotes dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) migration to mitochondria, ultimately leads to excessive mitochondrial fission of renal TECs. In conclusion, our study suggests that RCAN1 could induce mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis by activating the downstream JNK/Mff signaling pathway. RCAN1 may be a potential therapeutic target for conferring protection against I/R- or cisplatin-AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles from colorectal cancer cells promote metastasis via the NOD1 signalling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36068649/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) have been shown to promote tumour metastasis via sensing tumour cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (EVs). Nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain 1 (NOD1), a cytoplasmic PRR, plays a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) by detecting bacterial products. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of NOD1, following identification of CRC cell-derived EVs (CRC-EVs), to potentiate CRC liver metastasis (CRC-LM), remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that CRC-EVs activate NOD1 in macrophages to initiate secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. NOD1-activated macrophages also promote CRC cell migration, while in a murine model of liver metastasis (LM), NOD1-deficient mice exhibit reduced metastasis following CRC-EV treatment. Furthermore, cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), a small Rho guanosine-5&amp;rsquo;-triphosphate (GTP)ase, is delivered by CRC-EVs into macrophages where it activates NOD1. In addition, EVs from the plasma of patients with CRC-LM mediate NOD1 activation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, high NOD1 expression in tumour tissues is associated with poor prognosis of CRC-LM. Our findings suggest that CRC-EVs activate NOD1 to promote tumour metastasis, thus, NOD1 may serve as a potential target in the diagnosis and treatment of CRC-LM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NAT10 regulates neutrophil pyroptosis in sepsis via acetylating ULK1 RNA and activating STING pathway</title>

&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04045-w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;NAT10 regulates neutrophil pyroptosis in sepsis via acetylating ULK1 RNA and activating STING pathway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence suggests that pyroptosis is involved in sepsis. However, the role of neutrophil pyroptosis in sepsis and the mechanisms remains elusive. We find that N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), an acetyltransferase responsible for the N4-acetylation of Cytidine (ac4C) in mRNA, is significantly downregulated in neutrophils from septic mice. Neutrophil-specific over-expression of NAT10 improves the survival and ameliorates lung injury in septic mice by inhibiting neutrophil pyroptosis. Notably, UNC-52-like kinase 1 (ULK1) is identified as the target of NAT10 in neutrophils. The decreased expression of NAT10 resultes in the decay of ULK1 transcripts and therefore the reduced expression of ULK1. As a regulator of STING phosphorylation, the loss of ULK1 enhances the activation of STING-IRF3 signaling and subsequently the elevated pyroptosis-inducing NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils. While over-expression of NAT10 restrains pyroptosis in neutrophils as well as septic lethality in mice by reversing the ULK1-STING-NLRP3 axis. The decreased expression of NAT10 are also observed in sepsis patients and its correlation with clinical severity is found. Collectively, our findings disclose that NAT10 is a negative regulator of neutrophil pyroptosis and its downregulation contributes to the progress of sepsis by exacerbating pyroptosis via the ULK1-STING-NLRP3 axis, therefore revealing a potential therapeutic target for sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the cGAS-STING Pathway Attenuates Lung Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via Regulating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Alveolar Epithelial Type II Cells of Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36091334/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosol dsDNA sensor, coupling with downstream stimulator of interferon genes (STING) located in the ER, which involves innate immune responses. The aim of our present study was to investigate the effects of cGAS on lung I/R injury via regulating ERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used Sprague-Dawley rats to make the lung I/R model by performing left hilum occlusion-reperfusion surgery. cGAS-specific inhibitor RU.521, STING agonist SR-717, and 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), the ERS inhibitor, were intraperitoneally administered in rats. Double immunofluorescent staining was applied to detect the colocalization of cGAS or BiP, an ERS protein, with alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECIIs) marker. We used transmission electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructure of ER and mitochondria. Apoptosis and oxidative stress in the lungs were assessed, respectively. The profiles of pulmonary edema and lung tissue injury were evaluated. And the pulmonary ventilation function was measured using a spirometer system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In lung I/R rats, the cGAS-STING pathway was upregulated, which implied they were activated. After cGAS-STING pathway was inhibited or activated in lung I/R rats, the ERS was alleviated after cGAS was inhibited, while when STING was activated after lung I/R, ERS was aggravated in the AECIIs, these results suggested that cGAS-STING pathway might trigger ERS responses. Furthermore, activation of cGAS-STING pathway induced increased apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress via regulating ERS and therefore resulted in pulmonary edema and pathological injury in the lungs of I/R rats. Inhibition of cGAS-STING pathway attenuated ERS, therefore attenuated lung injury and promoted pulmonary ventilation function in I/R rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway attenuates lung ischemia/reperfusion injury via alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress in alveolar epithelial type II cells of rats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phenotypic drug screen uncovers the metabolic GCH1/BH4 pathway as key regulator of EGFR/KRAS-mediated neuropathic pain and lung cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) generated in injured sensory neurons contributes to increased pain sensitivity and its persistence. GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo BH4 synthetic pathway, and human single-nucleotide polymorphism studies, together with mouse genetic modeling, have demonstrated that decreased GCH1 leads to both reduced BH4 and pain. However, little is known about the regulation of &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression upon nerve injury and whether this could be modulated as an analgesic therapeutic intervention. We performed a phenotypic screen using about 1000 bioactive compounds, many of which are target-annotated FDA-approved drugs, for their effect on regulating &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression in rodent injured dorsal root ganglion neurons. From this approach, we uncovered relevant pathways that regulate &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression in sensory neurons. We report that EGFR/KRAS signaling triggers increased &lt;em&gt;Gch1&lt;/em&gt; expression and contributes to neuropathic pain; conversely, inhibiting EGFR suppressed GCH1 and BH4 and exerted analgesic effects, suggesting a molecular link between EGFR/KRAS and pain perception. We also show that GCH1/BH4 acts downstream of KRAS to drive lung cancer, identifying a potentially druggable pathway. Our screen shows that pharmacologic modulation of GCH1 expression and BH4 could be used to develop pharmacological treatments to alleviate pain and identified a critical role for EGFR-regulated GCH1/BH4 expression in neuropathic pain and cancer in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymerase δ-interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) has been reported to mediate acute lung injury (ALI); however, the underlying mechanism is not fully explored. Male C57BL/6 mice and A549 cells were used to establish the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model, then the expression of Poldip2 and its effect on oxidative stress and the resulting inflammation were detected. Adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) mediated Poldip2 knockdown was transfected into mice via intratracheal atomization. And A549 cells stimulated with LPS was used to further confirm our hypothesis in vitro. ML385, specifically inhibited the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Our data suggested that LPS stimulation remarkably increased protein levels of Nox4 and p-P65, activities of NADPH and MPO, and generation of ROS, TNF-α, and IL-1β while decreased protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 compared with those in NC shRNA + Saline group, which were obviously reversed by Poldip2 knockdown. Concomitantly, Poldip2 knockdown dramatically reduced contents of MDA and enhanced activities of SOD and GSH-Px compared to NC shRNA + LPS group. In vitro, we found that knockdown of Poldip2 significantly reversed LPS-induced increase protein levels of Nox4 and p-P65, activity of NADPH, and generation of ROS, TNF-α, and IL-1β, and decrease protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1, ML385 pretreatment reversed the effects of Poldip2 knockdown mentioned above. Our study indicated that Poldip2 knockdown alleviates LPS-induced ALI via inhibiting Nox4/Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening clinical problem with high mortality rate and limited treatments or preventive options that represents a major challenge for clinicians. Diacerein (DIA) is a multi-target anthraquinone derivative with potent anti-inflammatory action. The aim of this study is to assess the protective effect of DIA and its potential molecular targets against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administrated DIA (50 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (5mg/kg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; DIA mitigated oxidative lung injury in LPS-challenged rats via significantly decreasing lung wet/dry (W/D) ratio, inflammatory cells infiltration, and lipid peroxidation, with concomitant elevation in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels in lung tissue. Likewise, DIA alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress and markedly halted inflammation triggered by LPS challenge in pulmonary tissue by suppressing NLRP3/IL-1β and TLR4/NF-κB signaling with parallel decrease in proinflammatory cytokine levels. Interestingly, DIA down regulated Sphk1/S1P axis, reduced GSK-3β and STAT3 proteins expression, and markedly decreased caspase-3 besides increasing Bcl-2 levels in lung tissue of LPS-challenged animals. These biochemical findings was simultaneously associated with marked improvement in histological alterations of lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; These findings verify the protective effect of DIA against LPS-induced ALI through targeting oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis. Importantly, DIA halted the hyperinflammatory state triggered by LPS via multi-faceted inhibitory effect on different signaling pathways, hence DIA could potentially reduce mortality in patients with ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenges in clinical applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attributed to their heterogeneity. It is believed that preconditioning of MSCs with active compounds may enhance the expression of potentially therapeutic molecules and thus achieve stable and effective therapeutic outcomes. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which pyrogallol increased the therapeutic efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) against LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI). hUCMSCs with pyrogallol treatment increased expression of HO-1 at both mRNA and protein levels, accompanied by Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1 (Keap1) degradation, and upregulation of the Nrf2 protein levels as well as nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Moreover, the modulation of Keap1 and Nrf2 as well as HO-1 upregulation by pyrogallol was reversed by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and a P38 kinase inhibitor (SB203580). Whereas, NAC pretreatment abrogated pyrogallol-mediated activation of P38 kinase, indicating that pyrogallol-derived ROS led to P38 kinase activation, thus promoting Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Additionally, we found that the induction of p62 by the pyrogallol-mediated ROS/P38/Nrf2 axis interacted with Keap1 and resulted in autophagic degradation of Keap1, which created a positive feedback loop to further release of Nrf2. Furthermore, the increased expression of HO-1 in pyrogallol-pretreated hUCMSCs led to enhanced inhibitory effects on LPS-mediated TLR4/P-P65 signaling in BEAS-2B cells, resulting in increasing suppression of LPS-indued expression of a series of pro-inflammatory mediators. Compared to untreated hUCMSCs, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with pyrogallol-primed hUCMSCs transplantation showed enhanced improvements in LPS-mediated lung pathological alterations, the increased lung index (lung/body ratio), apoptosis of epithelial cells, the activation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling as well as the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Together, these results suggested that hUCMSCs with pyrogallol pretreatment enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSCs, which may provide a promising therapeutic strategy to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSC-based therapy for treating LPS-associated ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting Myocardial Mitochondria-STING-Polyamine Axis Prevents Cardiac Hypertrophy in Chronic Kidney Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36061341/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitochondrial damage is early and prominent in cardiomyocytes under CKD milieu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitochondrial damage stimulates myocardial STING-NFκB pathway to drive hypertrophy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFκB transactivates ODC1-PUT metabolic flux in cardiomyocytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ODC1-PUT metabolic flux is required for STING/NFκB-driven cardiac hypertrophy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting mitochondria-STING-ODC1 axis prevents cardiac hypertrophy in CKD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is well recognized as a distinct contributor to cardiac hypertrophy, while the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, the authors show that myocardial mitochondrial oxidative damage is early and prominent in CKD and distinctively stimulates the STING-NFκB pathway by releasing mitochondrial DNA to drive cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, the authors reveal that ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1)-putrescine metabolic flux is transactivated by NFκB and is required for the STING-NFκB pathway to drive cardiac hypertrophy. Finally, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the myocardial mitochondria-STING-NFκB-ODC1 axis significantly prevents CKD-associated cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, targeting the myocardial mitochoandria-STING-NFκB-ODC1 axis is a promising therapeutic strategy for cardiac hypertrophy in patients with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypoxia-induced lncRNA STEAP3-AS1 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote colorectal cancer progression by preventing m6A-mediated degradation of STEAP3 mRNA</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35986274/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35986274/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Hypoxia, a typical hallmark of solid tumors, exhibits an essential role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), in which the dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is frequently observed. However, the underlying mechanisms are not clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The TCGA database was analyzed to identify differential lncRNA expression involved in hypoxia-induced CRC progression. qRT-PCR was conducted to validate the upregulation of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; in CRC cell lines and tumor-bearing mouse and zebrafish models under hypoxia. ChIP-qRT-PCR was used to detect the transcriptional activation of STEAP3-AS1 mediated by HIF-1α. RNA-seq, fluorescent in situ hybridization, RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and immunoblot experiments were used to ascertain the involved mechanisms. Functional assays were performed in both in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the regulatory role of &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt;/STEAP3/Wnt/β-catenin axis in CRC proliferation and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Here, we identified a hypoxia-induced antisense lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; that was highly expressed in clinical CRC tissues and positively correlated with poor prognosis of CRC patients. Upregulation of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt;, which was induced by HIF-1α-mediated transcriptional activation, facilitated the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; interacted competitively with the YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2), a N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) reader, leading to the disassociation of YTHDF2 with &lt;em&gt;STEAP3&lt;/em&gt; mRNA. This effect protected &lt;em&gt;STEAP3&lt;/em&gt; mRNA from m6A-mediated degradation, enabling the high expression of STEAP3 protein and subsequent production of cellular ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). Increased Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels elevated Ser 9 phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and inhibited its kinase activity, thus releasing β-catenin for nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of Wnt signaling to support CRC progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Taken together, our study highlights the mechanisms of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; in facilitating CRC progression involving the &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt;/STEAP3/Wnt/β-catenin axis, which may provide novel diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets to benefit CRC treatment. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1α transcriptionally upregulates the expression of lncRNA STEAP3-AS1, which interacts competitively with YTHDF2, thus upregulating mRNA stability of STEAP3 and consequent STEAP3 protein expression. The enhanced STEAP3 expression results in production of cellular ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), which induces the Ser 9 phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β, releasing β-catenin for nuclear translocation and contributing to subsequent activation of Wnt signaling to promote CRC progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eupalinolide B attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury through inhibition of NF-κB and MAPKs signaling by targeting TAK1 protein</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35988521/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eupalinolide B (EB) inhibit LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EB directly binds to TAK1, and inhibits NF-κB and MAPKs activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The α,γ-unsaturated lactone of EB is vital for its anti-inflammatory effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease characterized by severe inflammatory response, which has no pharmacological therapy in clinic. In this study, we found that eupalinolide B (EB), a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Eupatorium lindleyanum, significantly ameliorated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice, which manifests as reduction in lung injury score, activity of myeloperoxidase, and release of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In RAW264.7 murine macrophages, EB effectively inhibited LPS-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by down-regulating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), respectively. Mechanistically, EB not only blocked LPS-induced phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase-α/β (IKKα/β), phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B alpha (IκBα), and phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) P65, but also suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Through cellular thermal shift assay and western blotting, EB was demonstrated to target and inactivate transforming growth factor β activated kinase-1 (TAK1), which is an important upstream kinase for the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs pathways. Additionally, EB-mediated actions were markedly abolished by dithiothreitol in LPS-exposed RAW264.7 cells, suggesting a crucial role of the α,γ-unsaturated lactone for the anti-inflammatory activity of EB. In conclusion, our findings showed that EB could effectively alleviate ALI in mice, and attenuate inflammatory response by inhibiting the activation of TAK1, and TAK1-mediated activation of NF-κB and MAPKs cascades.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oxypeucedanin relieves LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the inflammation and maintaining the integrity of the lung air-blood barrier</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35985771/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is commonly accompanied by a severe inflammatory reaction process, and effectively managing inflammatory reactions is an important therapeutic approach for alleviating ALI. Macrophages play an important role in the inflammatory response, and this role is proinflammatory in the early stages of inflammation and anti-inflammatory in the late stages. Oxypeucedanin is a natural product with a wide range of pharmacological functions. This study aimed to determine the effect of oxypeucedanin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the following experiments were performed based on LPS-induced models &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Using myeloperoxidase activity measurement, ELISA, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting, we found that oxypeucedanin modulated the activity of myeloperoxidase and decreased the expression levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, MPO, COX-2 and iNOS in LPS-induced inflammation models. Meanwhile, oxypeucedanin inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT and its downstream NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, oxypeucedanin significantly decreased the pulmonary vascular permeability, which was induced by LPSs, and the enhanced expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin and Claudin 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of oxypeucedanin is associated with the inhibition of the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways and the maintenance of the integrity of the lung air-blood barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-192-5p/RB1/NF-κBp65 signaling axis promotes IL-10 secretion during gastric cancer EMT to induce Treg cell differentiation in the tumour microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35969010/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35969010/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Regulatory T (Treg) cells are important components of the tumour microenvironment (TME) that play roles in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. Although tumour cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulate Treg cell function, their regulatory mechanism in GC remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The miR-192-5p was identified by examining three Gene Expression Omnibus GC miRNA expression datasets. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted to identify interactions between miR-192-5p and RB1. The role of miR-192-5p/RB1 in GC progression was evaluated based on EdU incorporation, wound healing and Transwell assays. An in vitro co-culture assay was performed to measure the effect of miR-192-5p/RB1 on Treg cell differentiation. In vivo experiments were conducted to explore the role of miR-192-5p in GC progression and Treg cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MiR-192-5p was overexpressed in tumour and was associated with poor prognosis in GC. MiR-192-5p bound to the RB1 3&amp;rsquo;-untranslated region, resulting in GC EMT, proliferation, migration and invasion. MiR-192-5p/RB1 mediated interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion by regulating nuclear factor-kappaBp65 (NF-κBp65), affecting Treg cell differentiation. NF-κBp65, in turn, promoted miR-192-5p expression and formed a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that miR-192-5p/RB1 promotes GC growth and Treg cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, our studies indicate that miR-192-5p/RB1 promotes EMT of tumour cells, and the miR-192-5p/RB1/NF-κBp65 signaling axis induces Treg cell differentiation by regulating IL-10 secretion in GC. Our results suggest that targeting miR-192-5p/RB1/NF-κBp65 /IL-10 may pave the way for the development of new immune treatments for GC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zanubrutinib ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via regulating macrophage polarization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zanubrutinib could relieve LPS induced lung injuries in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway is involved in Zanubrutinib -mediated M1 macrophage polarization in RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zanubrutinib promotes M2 macrophage activation through regulating JAK/STAT6 and PI3K/AKT pathway in RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a disease characterized by pulmonary diffusion dysfunction and its exacerbation stage is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may develop to multiple organ failure and seriously threatens human health. ALI has high mortality rates and few effective treatments, thus effective protection measures for ALI are becoming increasingly important. Macrophages play a key regulatory role in the pathogenesis of ALI, and the degree of macrophage polarization is closely related to the severity and prognosis of ALI. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Zanubrutinib (ZB), a BTK small molecule inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of cell lymphoma, on macrophage polarization and acute lung injury. In the in vivo study, we constructed a mouse model of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury and found that ZB could improve the acute injury of mouse lungs by inhibiting the secretion of proinflammatory factors and promoting the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, reduce the number of inflammatory cells in alveolar lavage fluid, and then alleviate the inflammatory response. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that ZB could inhibit the M1 macrophage polarization and promote the M2 macrophage polarization. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that ZB could inhibit the macrophage M1 polarization via targeting BTK activation and inhibiting JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways, and promote the macrophage M2 polarization by promoting the activation of STAT6 and PI3K / Akt signaling pathways. In summary, ZB has shown therapeutic effect in LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, which provides a potential candidate drug to treat acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CircSV2b participates in oxidative stress regulation through miR-5107-5p-Foxk1-Akt1 axis in Parkinson&#39;s disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35973363/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircSV2b in serum exosomes can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircSV2b participates in the progress of PD through the ceRNA-Akt1 axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircSV2b overexpression is neuroprotective by resisting oxidative stress injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foxk1 can regulate Akt1 transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a novel type of non-coding RNAs, covalently closed circular RNAs (circRNAs) are ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes. Emerging studies have indicated that dysregulation of circRNAs was related to neurological diseases. However, the biogenesis, regulation, function, and mechanism of circRNAs in Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) remain largely unclear. In this study, thirty-three differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) were detected by RNA-sequencing between the MPTP-induced PD mice model and the wild-type mice. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the RNA level of DECs in the striatum (STR), substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and serum exosomes, and it was found that circSV2b was downregulated in PD mice. Then, functional experiments in vivo were employed to explore the effect of circSV2b in PD. For the mechanism study, dual-luciferase reporter, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull-down, gene editing, and CUT &amp;amp; Tag were performed in vitro to confirm that circSV2b directly sponged miR-5107-5p and alleviated the suppression of the expression of the target gene Foxk1, and then positively regulated Akt1 transcription. In vivo, the mechanistic analysis demonstrated that circSV2b overexpression resisted oxidative stress damage through the ceRNA-Akt1 axis in PD models. Taken together, these findings suggested that the miR-5107-5p-Foxk1-Akt1 axis might serve as a key target of circSV2b overexpression in PD treatment, and highlighted the significant change of circSV2b in serum exosomes. Therefore, circSV2b might be a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperuricemia is an independent hazard factor of renal injury and can induce renal fibrosis, promoting the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to explore the probability of chlorogenic acid (CGA) as a potential substance for preventing hyperuricemia nephropathy (HN). Pretreatment with CGA downregulated SUA, BUN, and CR levels, relieved oxidative stress and inflammatory response, alleviated kidney fibrosis, and contributed to the prevention of HN. In the gut microbiota, &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Faecalibaculum&lt;/em&gt; related to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) synthesis were significantly increased in HN rats. In addition, it showed a significant increase in serum TMAO content in HN rats. However, CGA regulated the cascade response of the microbiota-TMAO signaling to reverse the increase of serum TMAO. CGA also decreased the protein expression of protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by reducing the production of TMAO. CGA delayed kidney fibrosis in HN rats as evidenced by regulating the cascade response of the microbiota-TMAO-PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In summary, CGA can be an excellent candidate for HN prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of the key ferroptosis-related genes involved in sepsis progression and experimental validation in vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36188533/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ferroptosis has a vital role in sepsis, but the mechanism is not known. Understanding the mechanism of ferroptosis during sepsis will aid in developing improved therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used the Gene Expression Omnibus database and FerrDb database to obtain ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between sepsis patients and healthy volunteers (HVs). Analyses of PPI networks, functional enrichment, as well as use of the MCODE algorithm were used to identify key ferroptosis-related DEGs. Expression of key ferroptosis-related DEGs was verified using: GSE57065 and GSE65682 datasets; rats in which ferroptosis was induced with erastin; sepsis-induced acute lung injury (siALI) rats. The effects of acupoint catgut embedding (ACE) on ferroptosis and expression of key ferroptosis-related DEGs in the lungs of siALI rats were also observed. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to verify the effect of key ferroptosis-related DEGs on the survival of sepsis patients. Cytoscape was used to construct ceRNA networks and gene-transcription factor networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Between sepsis patients and HVs, we identified 33 ferroptosis-related DEGs. According to analyses of PPI networks and the MCODE algorithm, we obtained four modules, of which the most significant module contained nine ferroptosis-related DEGs. Functional-enrichment analyses showed that four of the nine DEGs were enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway: &lt;em&gt;MAPK14&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;VEGFA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TGFBR1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DUSP1&lt;/em&gt;. We verified expression of these four genes in GSE57065 and GSE65682 datasets and ferroptosis rats. In addition, expression of these four genes and that of the oxidative-stress indicators GSSG and MDA was upregulated, and glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4) expression was downregulated, in siALI rats, but ACE reversed these changes. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that survival of sepsis patients in the high-risk group was shorter than that in the low-risk group. We found that the XIST-hsa-let-7b-5p-TGFBR1/DUSP1 ceRNA network and transcription factor E2F1 may be important regulators of these four DEGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results suggest that &lt;em&gt;MAPK14&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;VEGFA,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;TGFBR1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DUSP1&lt;/em&gt; may be key regulatory targets of ferroptosis in sepsis, and that ACE pretreatment may be antioxidant treatment for sepsis and alleviate ferroptosis. These findings provide a basis for further ferroptosis-related study in sepsis and provide new targets for its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autoinducer-2 promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36033859/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that causes various acute and chronic lung infections in immunocompromised patients. We previously found that a quorum sensing (QS) signal, namely, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), facilitates the pathogenicity of the wild-type (WT) &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 strain &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. However, the immunological mechanism that leads to pulmonary injury remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of AI-2 on interleukin-17A (IL-17A) production during acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 lung infection using a mouse model, with an emphasis on the underlying immunological mechanism. Compared to infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 alone, infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 combined with AI-2 treatment resulted in significantly increased levels of IL-17A, numbers of Th17 cells and levels of STAT3 in the lung tissues of WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), as well as more serious lung damage. In contrast, the concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and the chemokine keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) were significantly reduced during &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infection in IL-17A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and no effects were observed after AI-2 treatment (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the level of IL-17A in the lungs of WT mice was significantly reduced following infection with a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; strain harboring mutations in the QS genes &lt;em&gt;lasR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rhlR&lt;/em&gt; compared with the level of IL-17A following infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1. Our data suggest that AI-2 promotes &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway by interfering with the QS systems of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. IL-17A may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infections in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Erythropoietin mediates re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages through PI3K/AKT signaling and protects mice against secondary infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016936/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure leads to a hypo-responsive state by macrophages to a secondary stimulation of LPS, known as endotoxin tolerance. However, recent findings show that functions of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages are not completely suppressed, whereas they undergo a functional re-programming process with upregulation of a panel of molecules leading to enhanced protective functions including antimicrobial and tissue-remodeling activities. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), exerts anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective activities. Nevertheless, the potential effects of EPO on functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages have not been investigated yet. Here, we found that initial LPS exposure led to upregulation of HIF-1α/EPO in macrophages and that EPO enhanced tolerance in tolerized macrophages and mice as demonstrated by suppressed proinflammatory genes such as &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; after secondary LPS stimulation. Moreover, we showed that EPO improved host protective genes in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages and mice, such as the anti-bacterial genes coding for cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (&lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;) and macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (&lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;), and the tissue-repairing gene vascular endothelial growth factor C (&lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;). Therefore, our findings indicate that EPO mediates the functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages. Mechanistically, we found that PI3K/AKT signaling contributed to EPO-mediated re-programming through upregulation of &lt;em&gt;Irak3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wdr5&lt;/em&gt; expression. Specifically, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK3) was responsible for inhibiting proinflammatory genes &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; in tolerized macrophages after LPS rechallenge, whereas WDR5 contributed to the upregulation of host beneficial genes including &lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;. In a septic model of mice, EPO pretreatment significantly promoted endotoxin-tolerant re-programming, alleviated lung injury, enhanced bacterial clearance, and decreased mortality in LPS-tolerized mice after secondary infection of &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;. Collectively, our results reveal a novel role for EPO in mediating functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages; thus, targeting EPO appears to be a new therapeutic option in sepsis and other inflammatory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD-L1 maintains neutrophil extracellular traps release by inhibiting neutrophil autophagy in endotoxin-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016930/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is not only an important molecule in mediating tumor immune escape, but also regulates inflammation development. Here we showed that PD-L1 was upregulated on neutrophils in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Neutrophil specific knockout of PD-L1 reduced lung injury in ARDS model induced by intratracheal LPS injection. The level of NET release was reduced and autophagy is elevated by PD-L1 knockout in ARDS neutrophils both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Inhibition of autophagy could reverse the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 knockout on NET release. PD-L1 interacted with p85 subunit of PI3K at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in neutrophils from ARDS patients, activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. An extrinsic neutralizing antibody against PD-L1 showed a protective effect against ARDS. Together, PD-L1 maintains the release of NETs by regulating autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in ARDS. Anti-PD-L1 therapy may be a promising measure in treating ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Allyl methyl trisulfide protected against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice via inhibition of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36003507/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allyl methyl trisulfide (AMTS) is one major lipid-soluble organosulfur compound of garlic. Previous studies have reported the potential therapeutic effect of garlic on acute lung injury (ALI) or its severe condition acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the specific substances that exert the regulatory effects are still unclear. In this study, we investigate the protective effects of AMTS on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice and explored the underlying mechanisms. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments, ICR mice were pretreated with 25-100 mg/kg AMTS for 7 days and followed by intratracheal instillation of LPS (1.5 mg/kg). The results showed that AMTS significantly attenuated LPS-induced deterioration of lung pathology, demonstrated by ameliorative edema and protein leakage, and improved pulmonary histopathological morphology. Meanwhile, the expression of inflammatory mediators and the infiltration of inflammation-regulation cells induced by LPS were also inhibited. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments also revealed that AMTS could alleviate inflammation response and inhibit the exaggeration of macrophage M1 polarization in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, we identified that AMTS treatment could attenuate the LPS-induced elevation of protein expression of p-IκBα, nuclear NF-κB-p65, COX2, iNOS, p-P38, p-ERK1/2, and p-JNK. Collectively, these data suggest that AMTS could attenuate LPS-induced ALI and the molecular mechanisms should be related to the suppression of the NF-κB and MAPKs pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Glycocalyx heparan sulfate cleavage promotes endothelial cell angiopoietin-2 expression by impairing shear stress-related AMPK/FoxO1 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35763350/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a key mediator of vascular disease during sepsis, and elevated plasma levels of Ang-2 are associated with organ injury scores and poor clinical outcomes. We have previously observed that biomarkers of endothelial glycocalyx (EG) damage correlate with plasma Ang-2 levels, suggesting a potential mechanistic linkage between EG injury and Ang-2 expression during states of systemic inflammation. However, the cell signaling mechanisms regulating Ang-2 expression following EG damage are unknown. In the current study, we determined the temporal associations between plasma heparan sulfate (HS) levels as a marker of EG erosion and plasma Ang-2 levels in children with sepsis and in mouse models of sepsis. Second, we evaluated the role of shear stress-mediated 5&amp;rsquo;-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in Ang-2 expression following enzymatic HS cleavage from the surface of human primary lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs). We found that plasma HS levels peaked before plasma Ang-2 levels in children and mice with sepsis. Further, we discovered that impaired AMPK signaling contributed to increased Ang-2 expression following HS cleavage from flow-conditioned HLMVECs, establishing a paradigm by which Ang-2 may be upregulated during sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA MNX1-AS1 sustains inactivation of Hippo pathway through a positive feedback loop with USP16/IGF2BP3 axis in gallbladder cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35953000/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MNX1-AS1 expression is upregulated in GBC and predicts poor prognosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overexpression of MNX1-AS1 facilitates the proliferation and metastasis of GBC cells in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MNX1-AS1 acts as a scaffold for recruiting USP16 to stabilize IGF2BP3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MNX1-AS1/IGF2BP3/Hippo pathway positive feedback loop contributes to GBC progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in multiple human cancers, which may offer great potential as putative targets for cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, the roles of most lncRNAs in gallbladder cancer (GBC) remain poorly understood. The objective of this research involves investigating the clinical implications and underlying mechanism of lncRNA motor neuron and pancreas homeobo×1 antisense RNA 1 (MNX1-AS1) in GBC. This study shows that MNX1-AS1 expression is elevated in the tissues of GBC patients, and is strongly associated with reduced patient survival. Functionally, MNX1-AS1 significantly stimulates the proliferation and metastasis of GBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MNX1-AS1 is transcriptionally activated by TEA domain family member 4 (TEAD4), and suppresses insulin-like growing factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) degradation by recruiting ubiquitin specific peptidase 16 (USP16). Furthermore, MNX1-AS1/IGF2BP3 axis inhibits the Hippo signaling pathway and subsequently activates TEAD4, thereby forming a positive feedback loop. According to our results, MNX1-AS1 facilitates tumorigenesis, progression and metastasis of GBC through a MNX1-AS1/IGF2BP3/Hippo pathway positive feedback loop, which could be both diagnostically and therapeutically helpful in GBC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USP25 Deficiency Exacerbates Acute Pancreatitis via Up-Regulating TBK1-NF-κB Signaling in Macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35934222/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Severe acute pancreatitis can easily lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome and death. Macrophages are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis (AP), and macrophage activation correlates with disease severity. In this study, we examined the role of ubiquitin-specific protease 25, a deubiquitinating enzyme and known regulator of macrophages, in the pathogenesis of AP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used L-arginine, cerulein, and choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet-induced models of AP in &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice and wild-type mice. We also generated bone marrow &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; chimeric mice and initiated L-arginine-mediated AP. Primary acinar cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from wild-type and &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice to dissect molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our results show that Usp25 deficiency exacerbates pancreatic and lung injury, neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, and systemic inflammatory responses in L-arginine, cerulein, and choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet-induced models of AP. Bone marrow &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; chimeric mice challenged with L-arginine show that &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in macrophages exaggerates AP by up-regulating the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Similarly, in vitro data confirm that Usp25 deficiency enhances the TBK1-NF-κB pathway, leading to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow-derived macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in macrophages enhances TBK1-NF-κB signaling, and the induction of inflammatory chemokines and type I interferon-related genes exacerbates pancreatic and lung injury in AP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Piceatannol-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway inhibition contributes to the alleviation of oxidative injury and collagen synthesis during pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35932616/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piceatannol lightened oxidative injury and collagen synthesis in lung tissues during pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piceatannol inhibited the activation and collagen synthesis of TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAK2 activation abolished the effects of piceatannol in TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is characterized by oxidative injury and excessive collagen synthesis in lung fibroblasts, causing impaired pulmonary function and chronic lung injury. Piceatannol, a dietary polyphenol, possesses vital pharmacological effects in metabolic disorders, cancers, cardiovascular disease and infectious disease; however, its role in PF is still not completely elucidated. Mice (8 to 10 weeks old) were administered bleomycin (BLM) intratracheally (2 U/kg) to establish an in vivo PF model. Murine primary lung fibroblasts were isolated and stimulated with TGF-β (10 ng/mL) for 48 h to induce its activation. Meanwhile, mice or primary lung fibroblasts were treated with different doses of piceatannol to observe its protective roles. Pulmonary function and arterial blood gas were detected to assess pulmonary physiological status. Collagen deposition and the mRNA levels of profibrotic genes were determined by H&amp;amp;E staining and RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the protein and mRNA markers, as well as end-product of oxidative stress were detected in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that pulmonary function was significantly impaired in BLM-induced mice, accompanied by elevated oxidative stress and excessive collagen synthesis. Piceatannol significantly improved pulmonary function and decreased oxidative injury as well as collagen synthesis in mice with PF. Mechanically, piceatannol treatment significantly inhibited the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in BLM-induced mice and TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts. Additional findings also demonstrated that coumermycin A1 (C-A1), an agonist of JAK2, could abolish the effects of piceatannol on TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts and reactivated the phosphorylation STAT3. Taken together, our study demonstrated that piceatannol could protect against oxidative injury and collagen synthesis during PF in a JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular histones induce inflammation and senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells by activating the AMPK/FOXO4 signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35913584/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is an abnormal immune-inflammatory response that is mainly caused by infection. It can lead to life-threatening organ dysfunction and death. Severely damaged tissue cells will release intracellular histones into the circulation as damage-related molecular patterns (DAMPs) to accelerate the systemic immune response. Although various histone-related cytotoxicity mechanisms have been explored, those that affect extracellular histones involved in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction are yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were stimulated with different concentrations of histones, and cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay. Cellular senescence was assessed by SA β-gal staining. C57BL/6 mice were treated with histones with or without BML-275 treatment. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 inflammasome proteins. The interaction of NLRP3 and ASC was detected by CoIP and immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we found that extracellular histones induced senescence and inflammatory response in a dose-dependent manner in cultured VSMCs. Histone treatment significantly promoted apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) as well as NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) interaction of inflammasomes in VSMCs. Forkhead box protein O4 (FOXO4), which is a downstream effector molecule of extracellular histones, was found to be involved in histone-regulated VSMC inflammatory response and senescence. Furthermore, the 5&amp;rsquo;-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway was confirmed to mediate extracellular histone-induced FOXO4 expression, and blocking this signaling pathway with an inhibitor can suppress vascular inflammation induced by extracellular histones &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Extracellular histones induce inflammation and senescence in VSMCs, and blocking the AMPK/FOXO4 pathway is a potential target for the treatment of histonemediated organ injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of PP2A /NLRP3 signaling pathway in ambient particulate matter 2.5 induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35926746/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambient particulate matter 2.5 (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) exposure has been linked to pulmonary fibrosis. However, the key signaling pathways remained unclear. In the present study, we applied a mouse model with myeloid-specific deletion of Ppp2r1a gene (encoding protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) A subunit) to identify the key signaling pathways involved in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced pulmonary fibrosis. PP2A Aα-/- homozygote mice and matched wild-type (WT) littermates were exposed to filtered air (FA), unfiltered air (UA), and concentrated PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; (CA) in a real-ambient PM exposure system for 8 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively. The mice exposed to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; displayed a progressive inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, the expressions of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, caspase-1, ASC and IL-1β were increased in mice lung following PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, indicating PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure caused pulmonary inflammation by the NLRP3 pathways activation. Furthermore, the effects of PM exposure on pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, oxidative stress, and pulmonary function damage were significantly enhanced in PP2A-/- mice compared to WT mice, indicating the role of PP2A in the regulation of pulmonary injury induced by PM exposure. In vitro study confirmed that PP2A was involved in the PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced inflammation response and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Importantly, we identified PP2A regulated the activation of NLRP3 pathways by direct dephosphorylating IRE1α in response to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PP2A-IRE1α-NLRP3 signaling pathway played a crucial role in regulating the inflammation response, triggering the lung fibrogenesis upon PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Our findings provide new insights into regulatory role of PP2A in human diseases upon the PM exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metabolic balance in colorectal cancer is maintained by optimal Wnt signaling levels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35904277/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wnt pathways are important for the modulation of tissue homeostasis, and their deregulation is linked to cancer development. Canonical Wnt signaling is hyperactivated in many human colorectal cancers due to genetic alterations of the negative Wnt regulator APC. However, the expression levels of Wnt-dependent targets vary between tumors, and the mechanisms of carcinogenesis concomitant with this Wnt signaling dosage have not been understood. In this study, we integrate whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screens with large-scale multi-omic data to delineate functional subtypes of cancer. We engineer APC loss-of-function mutations and thereby hyperactivate Wnt signaling in cells with low endogenous Wnt activity and find that the resulting engineered cells have an unfavorable metabolic equilibrium compared with cells which naturally acquired Wnt hyperactivation. We show that the dosage level of oncogenic Wnt hyperactivation impacts the metabolic equilibrium and the mitochondrial phenotype of a given cell type in a context-dependent manner. These findings illustrate the impact of context-dependent genetic interactions on cellular phenotypes of a central cancer driver mutation and expand our understanding of quantitative modulation of oncogenic signaling in tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PTPRO knockdown protects against inflammation in hemorrhage shock-induced lung injury involving the NF-κB signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35906634/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Hemorrhage shock (HS) is characterized by decreased tissue oxygenation and organ damage due to severe blood loss. Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) is abnormally up-regulated in the rat lungs after trauma/HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of PTPRO in lung inflammation following HS, we established a rat model of HS via withdrawing blood by a catheter inserted into the femoral artery followed by resuscitation. The rats were infected with lentivirus harboring short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting PTPRO by intratracheal instillation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; PTPRO was significantly up-regulated in rat lungs after HS. PTPRO knockdown enhanced epithelial integrity and reduced capillary leakage by up-regulating tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin (OCC) in the lungs. Besides, HS-induced myeloperoxidase activity and inflammatory cell infiltration was mitigated by PTPRO knockdown. The expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-2, MCP-1, and KC) in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was regressed after PTPRO knockdown. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway was involved in HS-induced lung inflammation. PTPRO down-regulation inhibited the NF-κB pathway activation by suppressing the phosphorylation of NF-κB and its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Taken together, we demonstrated that PTPRO knockdown may contribute to attenuating inflammation in HS-induced lung injury via inhibiting NF-κB pathway activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Glaesserella parasuis induces IL-17 production might through PKC-ERK/MAPK and IκB/NF-κB signaling pathways</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infections upregulated IL-17 production both in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virulent &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; strains could induced higher IL-17 production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-17 expression positively correlated with degree of pathological tissue injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infection induced IL-17 production through PKC-ERK/MAPK and IκB/NF-κB pathways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our previous study, the outer membrane protein P2 of &lt;em&gt;Glaesserella parasuis&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt;) induced the production of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in host cells. However, how the &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infection produces IL-17A in the host is unknown. In this study, at 48 hpi in piglets, the proportion of Th17 cells in the peripheral blood significantly increased as determined by flow cytometry, but the overall proportion was low. IL-17 mRNA and protein levels significantly increased in the lungs and spleens of infected piglets. Histopathological examination staining, immunohistochemistry and viability counts, revealed that IL-17 expression might be positively correlated with bacterial content and the degree of pathological injury in lung and spleen tissues. Furthermore, when infected with the &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; Nagasaki strain compared with avirulent strain C5, the primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) significantly produced IL-17 in a time-dose dependent manner. In addition, we demonstrated that PKC, MEK and NF-κB signaling pathways were essential for &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt;-induced IL-17 production because the addition of corresponding inhibitors dramatically reduced IL-17 mRNA production. The phosphorylation levels of PKC, ERK1/2 and IκB in &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt;-infected primary PAMs also increased significantly as the infection dose increased as assessed by western blotting. Thus, these finding imply that IL-17 induced by &lt;em&gt;G. parasuis&lt;/em&gt; infection is dependent on activation of PKC-ERK/MAPK and IκB/NF-κB signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation promotes alveolar epithelial recovery by activating Hippo/YAP signaling after lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35973885/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The preferred configuration for bridging patients with respiratory failure while awaiting lung transplantation is venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO). However, the protective effect of VV ECMO on the lung, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the role of VV ECMO in preventing lung injury in vivo using a rat model. Additionally, the effects of Hippo/YAP signaling on alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2)-mediated alveolar epithelial recovery in VV ECMO rats were also investigated. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, RNA sequencing, lung injury, edema, and cytokine expression were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; VV ECMO significantly improved severe hypoxemia, reduced lung edema, and inflammatory response, and altered alveolar epithelial function, as indicated by reduced protein concentrations in BALF. This was associated with Hippo/YAP signaling activation, according to RNA sequencing analysis. Furthermore, we discovered that after VV ECMO, AT2 cells proliferated and differentiated, and this increase in AT2 cell activity was correlated to the increased nuclear expression of YAP, which is critical for alveolar epithelial recovery from lung injury. During VV ECMO, verteporfin-induced YAP inhibition and the loss of the oxygenator delayed lung alveolar epithelial recovery and led to a prolonged inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings suggest that VV ECMO protects against lung injury by activating the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. Strategies aimed at increasing YAP activity in AT2 cells could thus aid alveolar epithelial recovery, making VV ECMO easier for lung transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;LINC01085&lt;/em&gt; is deleted in hormone-independent prostate cancer (HIPC) which can predict better outcomes of HIPC patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01085 acts as a tumor suppressor in the tumourigenicity and metastasis of HIPC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01085 exerts its functions by both interacting with TBK1 and GSK3β, accelerated TBK1 phosphorylation at the Ser-172 site, in HIPC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01085 combined with PARP inhibitor and anti-PD-L1 treatment may be pivotal in the treatment of HIPC patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquired docetaxel (doc) resistance, one of the major reasons for unfavorable prognosis in patients with aggressive hormone-independent prostate cancer (HIPC), is a major obstacle for patient treatment. Dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs promotes or suppresses chemoresistance in multiple cancers; however, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying HIPC remain unknown. In this study, we found that the LINC01085, as a tumor-suppressor, which showed significant clinically relevant in HIPC patients with doc-resistance. Mechanistically, in docetaxel-sensitive cells, LINC01085 could specifically bind to both TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and higher LINC01085 RNA levels could inhibit TBK1 dimerization. Whereas, in doc-resistant cells, lower LINC01085 RNA level lost the strong binding with both, meanwhile, the interaction between TBK1 and GSK3β enhanced which accelerated TBK1 phosphorylation at the Ser-172 site, resulting in decreased expression levels of PD-L1 and NF-κB as well as the secretion of type I/III interferons. Thus, Overexpression of LINC01085 combined with immune checkpoint blockade is an effective strategy for the treatment of HIPC patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A comprehensive network map of IL-17A signaling pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is one of the member of IL-17 family consisting of other five members (IL-17B to IL-17F). The Gamma delta (γδ) T cells and T helper 17 (Th17) cells are the major producers of IL-17A. Aberrant signaling by IL-17A has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury, chronic airway diseases, and cancer. Activation of the IL-17A/IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) system regulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT serine/threonine kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) mediated signaling pathways. The IL-17RA activation orchestrates multiple downstream signaling cascades resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, chemokines (C-X-C motif) and promotes neutrophil-mediated immune response. Considering the biomedical importance of IL-17A, we developed a pathway resource of signaling events mediated by IL-17A/IL-17RA in this study. The curation of literature data pertaining to the IL-17A system was performed manually by the NetPath criteria. Using data mined from the published literature, we describe an integrated pathway reaction map of IL-17A/IL-17RA consisting of 114 proteins and 68 reactions. That includes detailed information on IL-17A/IL-17RA mediated signaling events of 9 activation/inhibition events, 17 catalysis events, 3 molecular association events, 68 gene regulation events, 109 protein expression events, and 6 protein translocation events. The IL-17A signaling pathway map data is made freely accessible through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5242&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WikiPathways Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the JAK/STAT Pathway with Baricitinib Reduces the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Caused by Hemorrhagic Shock in Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35837955/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; The aim of this study was to investigate (a) the effects of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway inhibitor (baricitinib) on the MODS in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock (HS) and (b) whether treatment with baricitinib attenuates the activation of JAK/STAT, NF-κB and NLRP3 caused by HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Post-traumatic MODS, which is in part due to excessive systemic inflammation, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The JAK/STAT pathway is a regulator of numerous growth factor and cytokine receptors and, hence, is considered a potential master regulator of many inflammatory signaling processes. However, its role in trauma-hemorrhage is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; An acute HS rat model was performed to determine the effect of baricitinib on MODS. The activation of JAK/STAT, NF-κB and NLRP3 pathways were analyzed by western blotting in the kidney and liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrate here for the first time that treatment with baricitinib (during resuscitation following severe hemorrhage) attenuates the organ injury and dysfunction and the activation of JAK/STAT, NF-κB and NLRP3 pathways caused by HS in the rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results point to a role of the JAK/STAT pathway in the pathophysiology of the organ injury and dysfunction caused by trauma/hemorrhage and indicate that JAK inhibitors, such as baricitinib, may be repurposed for the treatment of the MODS after trauma and/or hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LINC00893 inhibits the progression of prostate cancer through miR-3173-5p/SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35818076/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the male urinary system. In recent years, the morbidity and mortality of PCa have been increasing due to the limited effects of existing treatment strategies. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00893 was reported to inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of papillary thyroid cancer cells, but its role in PCa has not been reported. This study aims to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of LINC00893 in regulating the progression of PCa cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We first compared LINC00893 expression levels between PCa tissues and normal prostate tissues through TCGA database. The relative LINC00893 expression levels were further validated in 66 pairs of PCa tissues and para-cancerous normal tissues, as well as in PCa cell lines. Gain-of-function experiment was performed by transfecting PCa cell with LINC00893 expression vector, and CCK (Cell count kit)-8, 5-Ethynyl-2&amp;rsquo;-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, colony information and transwell assays were conducted to assess the functional phenotypes. Dual-luciferase reporter, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pull-down assays were performed to evaluate the molecular interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; LINC00893 was downregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines, and patients with low expression of LINC00893 were associated with a poorer overall survival rate. LINC00893 overexpression hindered the proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as the migratory ability of PCa cells, and suppressed the tumorigenesis of PCa cells in nude mice. We further demonstrated that LINC00893 acted as a sponge for miR-3173-5p and inhibited its activity, which in turn regulated the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)/Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study demonstrated that LINC00893 suppresses the progression of PCa cells through targeting miR-3173-5p/SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 axis. Our data uncovers a novel tumor-suppressor role of LINC00893 in PCa, which may serve as a potential strategy for targeted therapy in PCa.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>p53/sirtuin 1/NF-κB Signaling Axis in Chronic Inflammation and Maladaptive Kidney Repair After Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35874713/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation contributes to maladaptive kidney repair, but its regulation is unclear. Here, we report that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is downregulated after repeated low-dose cisplatin (RLDC) injury, and this downregulation leads to p65 acetylation and consequent NF-κB activation resulting in a persistent inflammatory response. RLDC induced the down-regulation of SIRT1 and activation of NF-κB, which were accompanied by chronic tubular damage, tubulointerstitial inflammation, and fibrosis in mice. Inhibition of NF-κB suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic phenotypes in RLDC-treated renal tubular cells. SIRT1 activation by its agonists markedly reduced the acetylation of p65 (a key component of NF-κB), resulting in the attenuation of the inflammatory and fibrotic responses. Conversely, knockdown of SIRT1 exacerbated these cellular changes. At the upstream, p53 was activated after RLDC treatment to repress SIRT1, resulting in p65 acetylation, NF-κB activation and transcription of inflammatory cytokines. In mice, SIRT1 agonists attenuated RLDC-induced chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and renal fibrosis. Together, these results unveil the p53/SIRT1/NF-κB signaling axis in maladaptive kidney repair following RLDC treatment, where p53 represses SIRT1 to increase p65 acetylation for NF-κB activation, leading to chronic renal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 Pathway Protects against Ferroptosis in Radiation-Induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35847598/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is one of the most common, serious, and dose-limiting toxicities of thoracic radiotherapy. A primary cause for this is the radiation-induced cell death. Ferroptosis is a recently recognized form of regulated cell death, characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS generated by irradiation might be the original trigger of ferroptosis in RILI. In addition, activation of the P62-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway has been shown to blunt ferroptosis and thus acts as a protective factor. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the protective effect of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway against radiation-induced ferroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells. First, we found that radiation induced ferroptosis in vitro using a RILI cell model, which could be significantly reduced by ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a specific ferroptosis inhibitor. Additionally, overexpression of P62 interacted with Keap1 to facilitate the translocation of NRF2 into the nucleus and promote the expression of its target proteins, including quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1). In summary, our results demonstrated that the activation of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway prevents radiation-induced ferroptosis in RILI cells, providing a theoretical basis of finding a potential therapeutic approach for RILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatiotemporal regulation of insulin signaling by liquid-liquid phase separation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35790738/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insulin signals through its receptor to recruit insulin receptor substrates (IRS) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to the plasma membrane for production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], which consequently activates protein kinase B (PKB). How insulin signals transduce from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm is not clearly understood. Here we show that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) plays a critical role in spatiotemporal control of insulin signaling through regulating multiple components including IRS1. Both protein concentration and insulin stimulation can drive the formation of intracellular IRS1 condensates through LLPS. Components including PI(4,5)P2, p85-PI3K and PDK1 are constitutively present in IRS1 condensates whereas production of PIP3 and recruitment of PKB in them are induced by insulin. Thus, IRS1 condensates function as intracellular signal hubs to mediate insulin signaling, whose formation is impaired in insulin resistant cells. Collectively, these data reveal an important function of LLPS in spatiotemporal control of insulin signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting p65 to inhibit Cas3 transcription by Onjisaponin B for radiation damage therapy in p65&#43;/- mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35816993/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35816993/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In response to radiation injury, p65 becomes activated. The formation of p65 is one target of Onjisaponin B (OB), but it has not been studied in radioprotection. In addition, there is a binding site for p65 in the promoter region of Cas3. This study evaluates the use of OB as an intervention to modulate p65/Cas3 following radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to confirm that OB regulated the transcription of Cas3 via p65 to overcome radiation-induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Cells and mice were exposed to X-rays at a dose of 6 Gy. Immunofluorescence was used to locate intracellular p65. For the protein and mRNA analyses, Western blotting and RT-qPCR-based assays were conducted accordingly. HE staining was used to observe pathological changes in tissues. DNA damage was detected by the comet assay and DNA ladder assay. Next, apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and Hoechst staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with the radiation group, the expression levels of p-p65 and c-Cas3 in the drug group were significantly down-regulated by OB 20 µg/ml. When the expression of p65 was suppressed in V79 and TC cells, OB did not significantly inhibit the activation of p65 or Cas3 in response to irradiation, nor did it significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of p65 and subsequent nuclear translocation. Overexpression of p65 in V79 and MTEC-1 cells resulted in OB significantly inhibiting the activation of p65 and Cas3, and the phosphorylation and translocation of p65 into the nucleus. At 3 d for V79 cells and 24 h for MTEC-1 cells after radiation, compared with the Cas3 over plasmid transfection group, the drug transfection group had no significant effect on reducing apoptosis. In p65+/- mice, expression of the p65 gene was knocked down, leading to increased tissue apoptosis and inflammation, and serious tissue pathological changes. The inhibition of p65 activation by OB after radiation exposure was not apparent in the thymus, although it was observed in the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; OB interfered with radiation injury by targeting and regulating p65/Cas3. Therefore, it has been concluded that p65 is an important target molecule for the treatment of radiation injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insights on the cGAS-STING Signaling Pathway During Herpesvirus Infections</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herpesviruses belong to large double-stranded DNA viruses. They are under a wide range of hosts and establish lifelong infection, which creates a burden on human health and animal health. Innate immunity is the host&amp;rsquo;s innate defense ability. Activating the innate immune signaling pathway and producing type I interferon is the host&amp;rsquo;s first line of defense against infectious pathogens. Emerging evidence indicates that the cGAS-STING signaling pathway plays an important role in the innate immunity in response to herpesvirus infections. In parallel, because of the constant selective pressure imposed by host immunity, herpesvirus also evolves to target the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to inhibit or escape the innate immune responses. In the current review, we insight on the classical cGAS-STING signaling pathway. We describe the activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway during herpesvirus infections and strategies of herpesvirus targeting this pathway to evade host antiviral response. Furthermore, we outline the immunotherapy boosting cGAS-STING signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prediction of the Mechanism of Sodium Butyrate against Radiation-Induced Lung Injury in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Dynamic Simulations and Molecular Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35837112/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a severe side effect of radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ,and one of the major hindrances to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. Previous studies have confirmed that sodium butyrate (NaB) has potential of anti-radiation toxicity. However, the mechanism of the protective effect of NaB against RILI has not yet been clarified. This study aimed to explore the underlying protective mechanisms of NaB against RILI in NSCLC through network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The predictive target genes of NaB were obtained from the PharmMapper database and the literature review. The involved genes of RILI and NSCLC were predicted using OMIM and GeneCards database. The intersectional genes of drug and disease were identified using the Venny tool and uploaded to the Cytoscape software to identify 5 core target genes of NaB associated with RILI. The correlations between the 5 core target genes and EGFR, PD-L1, immune infiltrates, chemokines and chemokine receptors were analyzed using TIMER 2.0, TIMER and TISIDB databases. We constructed the mechanism maps of the 3 key signaling pathways using the KEGG database based on the results of GO and KEGG analyses from Metascape database. The 5 core target genes and drug were docked using the AutoDock Vina tool and visualized using PyMOL software. GROMACS software was used to perform 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation. Irradiation-induced lung injury model in mice were established to assess the therapeutic effects of NaB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 51 intersectional genes involved in NaB against RILI in NSCLC were identified. The 5 core target genes were AKT1, TP53, NOTCH1, SIRT1, and PTEN. The expressions of the 5 core target genes were significantly associated with EGFR, PD-L1, immune infiltrates, chemokines and chemokine receptors, respectively. The results from GO analysis of the 51 intersectional genes revealed that the biological processes were focused on the regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, oxidative stress and cell death, while the three key KEGG pathways were enriched in PI3K-Akt signal pathway, p53 signal pathway, and FOXO signal pathway. The docking of NaB with the 5 core target genes showed affinity and stability, especially AKT1. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments showed that NaB treatment significantly protected mice from RILI, with reduced lung histological damage. In addition, NaB treatment significantly inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; NaB may protect patients from RILI in NSCLC through multiple target genes including AKT1, TP53, NOTCH1, SIRT1 and PTEN, with multiple signaling pathways involving, including PI3K-Akt pathway, p53 pathway, and FOXO pathways. Our findings effectively provide a feasible theoretical basis to further elucidate the mechanism of NaB in the treatment of RILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The protective effects of Mai-Luo-Ning injection against LPS-induced acute lung injury via the TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35793597/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe inflammatory disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Various therapeutic strategies for ALI have been proposed over the last few decades; however, the treatment options remain limited. Mai-Luo-Ning injection (MLN), a traditional Chinese medical formulation, has been extensively used for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Nevertheless, the effects of MLN on ALI remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to investigate the protective and therapeutic effects of MLN on lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI mouse models and RAW 264.7 cells, and further explore the underlying mechanism of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The therapeutic activity of MLN was evaluated using an &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; ALI model and an in vitro model of RAW 264.7 macrophages. UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS was used to investigate the chemical constituents of the MLN. The material basis and potential protective mechanism of MLN were analyzed using network pharmacology. The roles of MLN in inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/ nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signalling pathway were investigated via western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments demonstrated that MLN ameliorated LPS-induced histological changes in lung tissues and reduced lung wet/dry weight ratio, total protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and myeloperoxidase activity. Furthermore, MLN downregulated the &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and in vitro expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that MLN could act synergistically through multiple targets and pathways and exert a protective effect, possibly through inhibiting TLR4/ NF-κB signalling pathways. Western blotting and immunofluorescence experiments further confirmed that MLN could regulate the expression of TLR4, MyD88, phospho-IκB-α, and phospho-NF-κB p65 in the TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway and decrease the translocation of phospho-NF-κB p65 into the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study suggests that MLN has a potential protective effect against LPS-induced ALI, which might be associated with the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway. Therefore, MLN is worthy of further investigation as a potential candidate for the treatment of ALI in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Garcinone C Suppresses Tumorsphere Formation and Invasiveness by Hedgehog/Gli1 Signaling in Colorectal Cancer Stem-like Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35749593/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperactivation of hedgehog signaling occurs in colorectal cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), a rare subpopulation, potentially involved in metastasis, chemotherapy resistance, and cancer relapse. Garcinone C, a xanthone isolated from mangosteen (&lt;em&gt;Garcinia mangostana&lt;/em&gt;), suppresses colorectal cancer &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; by inhibiting Gli1-dependent noncanonical hedgehog signaling. Herein, we investigated the effect of garcinone C on cancer stemness and invasiveness in colorectal cancer; Gli1 was noted as pivotal in maintaining stemness and invasiveness in HCT116 and HT29 CSCs. Garcinone C inhibited the proliferation and self-renewal of HCT116 and HT29 CSCs. Colon cancer stemness markers such as CD44, CD133, ALDH1, and Nanog were significantly decreased by garcinone C. Computational studies showed that garcinone C showed a high affinity with the Gli1 protein ZF domain by forming hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues of ASP244, ARG223, and ASP216. Besides, MG132 blocked the effects of garcinone C on Gli1. Thus, garcinone C suppressed colorectal CSCs by binding to Gli1 and enhancing its degradation. MMP2 and MMP9 levels, invasive-related markers, were increased in HCT116 CSCs but decreased by garcinone C. E-cadherin level was reduced in HCT116 CSCs, while the presence of garcinone C was restored. Garcinone C inhibited the proliferation and invasiveness of colorectal CSCs by targeting Gli1-dependent Hh signaling. Garcinone C may be a potent natural agent against colorectal cancer relapse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01194 was highly expressed in TNBC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01194 recruited NUMA1 to stabilize UBE2C mRNA, thereby promoting RYR2 ubiquitination and degradation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINC01194/NUMA1/UBE2C/RYR2/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway might provide an effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 1194 (LINC01194) has been reported as an oncogene in several cancer types, but its expression and potential role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are still unclear. We found that LINC01194 was significantly highly expressed in TNBC based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Data from in vitro experiments and in vivo assays demonstrated that LINC01194 promoted TNBC progression. Through bioinformatics prediction, mass spectrometry, and mechanical experiments, we found that LINC01194 could recruit nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1 (NUMA1) to bind to the untranslated region (3&amp;rsquo;UTR) of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 C (UBE2C) 3&amp;rsquo; and stabilize UBE2C mRNA. Moreover, we found that UBE2C acted as an ubiquitin ligase to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of ryanodine receptor type 2 (RYR2) that inhibited the progression of TNBC by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In summary, LINC01194 activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and accelerates the malignant progression of TNBC by recruiting NUMA1 to stabilize UBE2C mRNA and thus promotes RYR2 ubiquitination and degradation. These findings might provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 conferred potent protection against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 inhibited M1 macrophage polarization, limiting its pro-inflammatory activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 suppressed NF-κB and STAT1 signaling by targeting IKKβ as well as STAT1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACT001 has been shown to exhibit excellent antitumor and anti-fibrosis activities. However, the role of ACT001 in acute lung injury (ALI) and the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of ACT001 on ALI and explore the potential mechanisms. Herein, we firstly established the ALI mouse model induced by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ACT001 treatment significantly alleviated histopathological changes of lung tissues with lower infiltration of pulmonary M1 macrophages in ALI mice. Then, we performed in vitro experiment and found that ACT001 treatment effectively inhibited the M1 phenotype of RAW264.7 and THP-1.. Next, we performed pull-down and mass spectrometry analysis to screen the interacting proteins of ACT001, identifying IKKβ and STAT1 as the critical target proteins of ACT001. And ACT001 treatment significantly suppressed the NF-κB and STAT1 pathways, thereby inhibiting the M1 polarization against inflammation in vivo and in vitro. Finally, we used IMD 0354 (IMD) and Fludarabine (Flud) to specifically block the activity of IKKβ and STAT1, and stimulated macrophages through IKKβ and STAT1 overexpression. Our data clearly showed that ACT001-induced decrease of the M1 polarization was blocked by IMD and Flud treatment, and reversed by IKKβ and STAT1 overexpression in RAW264.7 cells. In conclusion, we discovered that ACT001 significantly alleviates inflammation and limits M1 phenotype of pulmonary macrophages via suppressing NF-κB and STAT1 signaling pathways, providing new insights for the development of drugs to treat ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High phosphate-induced progressive proximal tubular injury is associated with the activation of Stat3/Kim-1 signaling pathway and macrophage recruitment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35713543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary phosphate intake in the Western population greatly exceeds the recommended dietary allowance and is linked to enhanced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It is unclear whether a chronic high phosphate diet (HPD) causes kidney injury in healthy individuals. Here, we show that feeding a 2% HPD in C57BL/6N mice for one up to six months resulted in hyperphosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia, increased plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) compared to mice on a 0.8% phosphate diet. Kidney injury was already noted after two months of HPD characterized by loss of proximal tubular (PT) cell polarity, flattened epithelia, disruption of brush border membranes, vacuolization, increased PT cell proliferation, marked interstitial mononuclear infiltration, and progressive accumulation of collagen fibers. HPD increased Stat3 activation and Kim-1 expression in PT epithelial cells and enhanced renal synthesis of chemokines recruiting monocytes and macrophages as well as macrophage related factors. Enhanced recruitment of F4/80+ macrophages around injured PT lesions was timely associated with increased Kim-1 synthesis, tubular MCP-1 expression, and degree of PT injury score. Likewise, tubulointerstitial fibrosis was associated with activation of Stat3/Kim-1 signaling pathway. The stimulation of human proximal tubular cells with high phosphate activated Stat3 signaling and induced HAVCR1 and CCL2 expression. We conclude that high phosphate results in progressive proximal tubular injury, indicating that high dietary phosphate intake may affect kidney health and therefore represents an underestimated health problem for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long non-coding RNA SNHG5 mediates periodontal inflammation through the NF-κB signalling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35713268/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the role of long non-coding RNAs and small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; A ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model was established, and gingival tissues were collected from patients with periodontitis and healthy controls. Inflammatory cytokines were detected using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analyses. Direct interactions between SNHG5 and p65 were detected by RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Micro-computed tomography, haematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemical staining were used to measure periodontal bone loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; SNHG5 expression was down-regulated in human and mouse periodontal tissues compared to that in the healthy controls. In vitro experiments demonstrated that SNHG5 significantly ameliorated tumour necrosis factor α-induced inflammation. Mechanistically, SNHG5 directly binds to the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 subunit and inhibits its translocation, thereby suppressing the NF-κB signalling pathway activation and reducing the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing three inflammasome expression. Locally injecting si-SNHG5 aggravated the periodontal destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study revealed that SNHG5 mediates periodontal inflammation through the NF-κB signalling pathway, providing a potential therapeutic target for periodontitis treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut dysbiosis promotes prostate cancer progression and docetaxel resistance via activating NF-κB-IL6-STAT3 axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35710492/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The gut microbiota is reportedly involved in the progression and chemoresistance of various human malignancies. However, the underlying mechanisms behind how it exerts some effect on prostate cancer, as an extra-intestinal tumor, in a contact-independent way remain elusive and deserve exploration. Antibiotic exposure, one of the various factors affecting the gut microbiota community and capable of causing gut dysbiosis, is associated with multiple disorders. This study aims to preliminarily clarify the link between gut dysbiosis and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; First, we discovered that perturbing the gut microbiota by consuming broad-spectrum antibiotics in water promoted the growth of subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors in mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation could transmit the effect of antibiotic exposure on tumor growth. Then, 16S rRNA sequencing for mouse feces indicated that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher after antibiotic exposure. Meanwhile, intratumoral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profoundly increased under the elevation of gut permeability. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that the NF-κB-IL6-STAT3 axis activated by intratumoral LPS facilitated prostate cancer proliferation and docetaxel chemoresistance. Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing of patients&amp;rsquo; fecal samples revealed that Proteobacteria was enriched in patients with metastatic prostate cancer and was positively correlated with plasma IL6 level, regional lymph node metastasis status, and distant metastasis status. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria had better performance than the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in predicting the probability of distant metastasis in prostate cancer (area under the ROC curve, 0.860; p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, this research demonstrated that gut dysbiosis, characterized by the enrichment of Proteobacteria due to antibiotic exposure, resulted in the elevation of gut permeability and intratumoral LPS, promoting the development of prostate cancer via the NF-κB-IL6-STAT3 axis in mice. Considering findings from human patients, Proteobacteria might act as an intestinal biomarker for progressive prostate cancer. Video Abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brevilin A Ameliorates Acute Lung Injury and Inflammation Through Inhibition of NF-κB Signaling via Targeting IKKα/β</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35774606/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is life-threatening disease characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory response. IKKα/β, the key kinases in the activation of NF-κB pathway, are implicated in inflammatory pulmonary injury, and represent attractive targets for ALI therapy. Brevilin A (BVA) is a sesquiterpene lactone from Centipeda minima, a Chinese herb used to treat inflammatory diseases. This study aims to investigate the inhibition of BVA on ALI, with focus on clarifying the molecular mechanisms involved in BVA-mediated anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages. Briefly, BVA significantly inhibited the production of NO and PGE2 by suppressing iNOS and COX2 expression, and suppressed the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα in LPS/IFNγ-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. The anti-inflammatory activity of BVA was further confirmed in LPS/IFNγ-stimulated BMDMs and TNFα/IFNγ-exposed RAW264.7 cells. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, BVA effectively attenuated LPS-induced lung damage, inflammatory infiltration, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including MPO, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and PGE2. Mechanistically, BVA could covalently bind to the cysteine 114 of IKKα/β, and effectively inhibiting the activity and function of IKKα/β, thereby resulting in the suppression of phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and the subsequent activation of NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, pretreatment of DTT, a thiol ligand donor, significantly abolished BVA-mediated effects in LPS/IFNγ-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, suggesting the crucial role of the electrophilic α, β-unsaturated ketone of BVA on its anti-inflammatory activity. These results suggest that BVA ameliorates ALI through inhibition of NF-κB signaling via covalently targeting IKKα/β, raising the possibility that BVA could be effective in the treatment of ALI and other diseases harboring aberrant NF-κB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;RP105 is a member of the TLR family and its expression plays a role in cardiovascular disease but the therapeutic impact on acute kidney injury remained unclear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have uncovered evidence that RP105 expression in proximal tubular cells plays a kidney protective role during ischemic and septic acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RP105 reduces tubular cell death, NF-κB activation and inflammatory response during AKI with a mechanism involving interaction with TLR4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This finding may have clinical translation as kidney protection and inflammation regulation could be achieved through RP105 gene therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical and severe clinical disease caused by a variety of factors. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in pathogenesis of AKI. Radioprotective 105 kDa protein (RP105) is a member of the TLR family, but the role of RP105 in AKI is unknown. In this study, we overexpressed RP105 in renal tissue and cultured proximal tubular cells in which we then induced ischemic and septic AKI. Renal structure injuries were examined by hematoxylin eosin staining, while renal function was assessed by measuring serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (SCr) levels. The TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis induced changes in the expression of RP105, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in renal tissue detected by Western blot. Inflammatory cytokines including iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The inflammatory indicators, F4/80 and MPO, were identified by IHC staining. The results showed that expression of the TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway was enhanced in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and septic renal injury, and that overexpression of RP105 in renal tissue alleviated ischemic and septic AKI. Moreover, RP105 gene delivery was associated with reduced renal inflammatory cells infiltration and inflammatory cytokines after AKI. RP105 overexpression also inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-κB after AKI in both in vitro and in vivo, and blunted the interaction between Myeloid Differentiation factor 2 (MD2) and TLR4. These results indicated that RP105 protected against renal ischemic and septic AKI injury by suppressing inflammatory responses mediated by TLR4 signaling pathways. This study suggests that the anti-inflammatory roles of RP105 have potential for preventing and treating renal ischemic and septic AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CREB1 contributes colorectal cancer cell plasticity by regulating lncRNA CCAT1 and NF-κB pathways</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CREB1 gene encodes an exceptionally pleiotropic transcription factor that frequently dysregulated in human cancers. CREB1 can regulate tumor cell status of proliferation and/or migration; however, the molecular basis for this switch involvement in cell plasticity has not fully been understood yet. Here, we first show that knocking out CREB1 triggers a remarkable effect of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and leads to the occurrence of inhibited proliferation and enhanced motility in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. By monitoring 45 cellular signaling pathway activities, we find that multiple growth-related pathways decline significantly while inflammatory pathways including NF-κB are largely upregulated in comparing between the CREB1 wild-type and knocked out cells. Mechanistically, cells with CREB1 knocked out show downregulation of MYC as a result of impaired CREB1-dependent transcription of the oncogenic lncRNA CCAT1. Interestingly, the unbalanced competition between the coactivator CBP/p300 for CREB1 and p65 leads to the activation of the NF-κB pathway in cells with CREB1 disrupted, which induces an obvious EMT phenotype of the cancer cells. Taken together, these studies identify previously unknown mechanisms of CREB1 in CRC cell plasticity via regulating lncRNA CCAT1 and NF-κB pathways, providing a critical insight into a combined strategy for CREB1-targeted tumor therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New mechanism of nephrotoxicity of triptolide: Oxidative stress promotes cGAS-STING signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35697291/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triptolide activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in kidney tubular cells in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STING inhibitor C176 had protective effects in TPL-induced nephrocyte damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triptolide induced an enhancement in protein levels of BACH1, while the expression of HMOX1 was reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oxidative stress-induced mtDNA damage and DNA leakage were the causes of the activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triptolide (TPL) is a bioactive component extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F., and has multiple pharmacological activities, such as anti-tumor activity. However, severe adverse effects and toxicity, especially nephrotoxicity, limit its clinical application. It has been demonstrated that mitochondrial defect is a major toxic effects of TPL. In this study, we show that triptolide activated the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in kidney tubular cells in vivo and in vitro. Renal injury models were established in BALB/c mice and human tubular epithelial cells using TPL. We found that TPL enhanced the phosphorylation levels of STING, TBK1 and IRF3, and upregulated the expression of IFNβ, which is the production of cGAS-STING signaling pathway. STING inhibitor C176 had protective effects in TPL-induced nephrocyte damage. STING siRNA down regulated the expression level of IFNβ. In addition, triptolide induced an increase in protein levels of the transcription factor BACH1, while transcriptional expression of the antioxidant enzyme HMOX1 was reduced due to the increased expression of BACH1. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced mtDNA damage and DNA leakage caused activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Altogether, cGAS-STING signaling pathway involved in TPL induced nephrotoxicity. Inhibiting cGAS-STING over-activation may be a new strategy for alleviating renal injury of triptolide.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigallocatechin Gallate Relieved PM2.5-Induced Lung Fibrosis by Inhibiting Oxidative Damage and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition through AKT/mTOR Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35707275/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative damage and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are main pathological processes leading to the development of PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis. Epigallocatechin gallate (EG), a natural polyphenol extracted from green tea, possesses the ability to combat oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the potential roles of EG in PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis have not been reported yet. In the present study, we investigated whether EG could relieve PM2.5-induced lung injury and fibrosis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. To mimic PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis, C57/BL6 mice were intranasally instilled with PM2.5 suspension, and MLE-12 lung epithelial cells were stimulated with PM2.5 (100 μg/mL) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. The results showed that intragastric administration of EG (20 mg/kg/d or 80 mg/kg/d for 8 weeks) significantly prevented lung injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress in PM2.5-induced mice, apart from inhibiting collagen deposition. Additionally, EG treatment also suppressed the activation of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in lung tissues challenged with PM2.5. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments further demonstrated that EG treatment could enhance cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner in PM2.5-treated MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. Also, the overexpression of constitutively active AKT could offset the inhibitory effects of EG on EMT and oxidative stress in PM2.5-treated MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. Finally, AKT overexpression also blocked the inhibitory effect of EG on the phosphorylation of mTOR in PM2.5-treated MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. In conclusion, EG could improve PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis by decreasing oxidative damage and EMT through AKT/mTOR pathway, which might be a potential candidate for the treatment of PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ginkgolide C Alleviates Acute Lung Injury Caused by Paraquat Poisoning via Regulating the Nrf2 and NF- κ B Signaling Pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35707280/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paraquat (PQ), a highly toxic herbicide and primary attack for lung, results in severe acute lung injury (ALI) appeared as evident oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Increasing evidence elucidates that nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) exhibit many merits for protection of ALI by coordinating a fine-turned response to oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Ginkgolide C (GC) has been reported to be a safe and potent therapeutic agent against ALI. However, whether GC could protect ALI induced by PQ poisoning and the possible underlining mechanisms have remained not to be fully elucidated. A rat model of ALI and a model of acute type II alveolar epithelial cell (RLE-6TN) injury constructed by exposure to PQ were applied to discuss the protective effect of GC. Furthermore, Nrf2 gene silencing RLE-6TN cells were used to discuss the exact mechanism. We confirmed that GC significantly ameliorated the histopathological damages, ultrastructural changes, lung injury score, W/D ratio, and Hyp activity of lung tissue and inhibited polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration after PQ poisoning. Further results revealed that GC remarkably activated Nrf2-based cytoprotective system and inhibited NF-κB-induced inflammatory injury as well as apoptosis. Taken together, we concluded that GC preserved protection of PQ-induced ALI via the Nrf2-NF-κB dependent signal pathway, which may provide us novel insights into the treatment strategies for PQ poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Angiotensin 1-7 mitigates rhabdomyolysis induced renal injury in rats via modulation of TLR-4/NF-kB/iNOS and Nrf-2/heme‑oxygenase-1 signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35654118/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RM induced kidney injury may be linked to the depletion of the ACE-2 and Ang1–7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ACE-2/Ang1–7/MasR axis may serve as a novel therapeutic option in RM-induced AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TLR-4/NF-kB/iNOS pathway may be involved in the renoprotective effect of Ang1–7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a critical condition with a high mortality rate, but effective management is still deficient. Till date, there are no studies that have addressed the effect of angiotensin 1-7 in this condition, hence, the rationale of this study was to evaluate the potential protective effect of Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7), on rhabdomyolysis (RM) induced kidney injury in rats and detecting the underlying mechanistic insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; Forty adult male albino rats were divided into groups; the control group, RM group, RM+Ang1-7 group, and RM+Ang1-7+ A779 group. Sera and urine samples were collected for analysis of renal and muscle injury markers. Kidney tissues were taken for estimation of oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers as well as angiotensin-II (Ang II) and Ang1-7. Renal histology and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase-1 (iNOS), real-time PCR for angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), nuclear erythroid factor-2 (Nrf-2), Toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and NF-kB in kidney tissues were also measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; Induction of RM caused renal oxidative stress injury, inflammation, apoptosis and marked deterioration in kidney functions as well as reduction of Ang1-7 and raised Angiotensin-II level in kidney tissues. Administration of Ang1-7 to the RM group reversed all the affected parameters which were blocked by A779 administration (Mas receptor blocker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; We concluded that Ang1-7 could be a potential therapeutic agent that could mitigate RM-induced renal injury. The underlying mechanisms may involve Stimulation of the ACE-2/Ang1-7/MasR axis and modulation of TLR-4/NF-kB/iNOS and Nrf-2/heme‑oxygenase -1 pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stat3/IL-6 signaling mediates sustained pneumonia induced by Agiostrongylus cantonensis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35617354/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angiostrongylus cantonensis (AC) is well-documented that parasitizes the host brain and causes eosinophilic meningitis. The migration route of AC in permissive hosts is well demonstrated, while in nonpermissive hosts, it remains to be fully defined. In the present study, we exploited live imaging technology, morphological and pathological configuration analysis, and molecular biological technologies to explore the migration route of AC and the accompanying tissue damage in nonpermissive and permissive hosts. Our data indicated that, in nonpermissive host mouse, AC larvae migrated from intestinal wall to liver at 2 hours post-infection (hpi), from liver to lung at 4 hpi and then from lung to brain at 8 hpi. AC larval migration caused fatal lung injury (pneumonia) during acute and early infection phases, along with significant activation of Stat3/IL-6 signaling. In addition, AC induce sustained interstitial pneumonia in mouse and rat and pulmonary fibrosis only in rat during late infection phase. Moreover, during the early and late infection phases, Th2 cytokine expression and Stat3 and IL-6 signaling were persistently enhanced and myeloid macrophage cells were notably enriched in host lung, and administration of Stat3 and IL-6 inhibitors (C188-9 and LMT-28) attenuated AC infection-induced acute pneumonia in mice. Overall, we are the first to provide direct and systemic laboratory evidence of AC migration route in a nonpermissive host and report that infection with a high dose of AC larvae could result in acute and fatal pneumonia through Stat3/IL-6 signaling in mice. These findings may present a feasible to rational strategy to minimize the pathogenesis induced by AC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of the AMPK-ULK1 pathway mediated protective autophagy by sevoflurane anesthesia restrains LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35605434/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevoflurane alleviates LPS-induced ALI by activating cell protective autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevoflurane triggers protective autophagy by activating AMPK/ULK1/PIKFYVE pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevoflurane restrains LPS-induced ALI via AMPK/ULK1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Sevoflurane anesthesia is deemed as potential therapeutic drug for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI), but the molecular mechanisms have not been fully delineated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim:&lt;/em&gt; The present study explored the specific molecular mechanism of sevoflurane regulating autophagy to reduce LPS induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male C57BL/6J mice and mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (MPVECs) were treated with LPS to construct ALI models, and the levels of inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy were detected after treatment with sevoflurane. Meanwhile, cells were treated with autophagy inhibitor or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) pathway inhibitor in vitro to detect their effects on cell survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Sevoflurane reduced inflammation, recovered cell division so as to suppress cell apoptosis and maintain cell survival, and activated autophagic flux in LPS-induced ALI models in vivo and in vitro. Of note, the suppressing effects of sevoflurane on LPS-induced cell death were abrogated by inhibiting autophagy. Moreover, we evidenced that sevoflurane promoted activation of the AMPK/ULK1 pathway in LPS-induced ALI models. Blockage of this pathway abrogated the promoting effects of sevoflurane on cell autophagy and cell viability in LPS-treated cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, sevoflurane suppresses apoptosis and inflammation via activating protective autophagy, thereby ameliorating LPS-induced ALI, and the AMPK/ULK1/ PIKFYVE pathway is responsible for the process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HCMV-miR-US33-5p promotes apoptosis of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells by targeting EPAS1/SLC3A2 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35596131/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35596131/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD), increased vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis has been found. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-miR-US33-5p was significantly increased in the plasma of patients with AAD. However, the roles of miR-US33-5p in human aortic VSMC (HA-VSMC) apoptosis remain to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In the current study, cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry, cell proliferation by CCK-8 assay, and differentially expressed genes by RNA sequencing. Luciferase reporter assay was used for binding analysis between miR-US33-5p and endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1), and EPAS1 and amino acid transporter heavy chain, member 2 (SLC3A2). The enrichment degree of SLC3A2 promoter DNA was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting were performed for measuring messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; It was found that HCMV infection inhibited proliferation but promoted HA-VSMC apoptosis by upregulating HCMV-miR-US33-5p. Transfection of HCMV-miR-US33-5p mimics the significant effect on several signaling pathways including integrin signaling as shown in the RNA sequencing data. Western blotting analysis confirmed that HCMV-miR-US33-5p mimics suppression of the activity of key factors of the integrin signal pathway including FAK, AKT, CAS, and Rac. Mechanistic study showed that HCMV-miR-US33-5p bound to the 3&amp;rsquo;-untranslated region of EPAS1 to suppress its expression, leading to suppression of SLC3A2 expression, which ultimately promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation. This was confirmed by the findings that silencing EPAS1 significantly reduced the SLC3A2 expression and inhibited proliferation and key factors of integrin signal pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; HCMV-miR-US33-5p suppressed proliferation, key factors of integrin signal pathway, and EPAS1/SLC3A2 expression, but promoted HA-VSMC apoptosis. These findings highlighted the importance of HCMV-miR-US33-5p/EPAS1/SCL3A2 signaling and may provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for AAD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study intends to investigate the effects of miR-142-5p encapsulated by serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) on septic acute lung injury (ALI) following remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) through a PTEN-involved mechanism. ALI was induced in rats by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, 24 h before which RIPC was performed via the left lower limb. Next, the binding affinity between miR-142-5p and PTEN was identified. EVs were isolated from serum and injected into rats. The morphology of lung tissues, pulmonary edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration into lung tissues were then assessed, and TNF-α and IL-6 levels in serum and lung tissues were measured. The results indicated that RIPC could attenuate ALI in sepsis. miR-142-5p expression was increased in serum, lung tissues, and serum-derived EVs of ALI rats following RIPC. miR-142-5p could target PTEN to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. miR-142-5p shuttled by serum-derived EVs reduced pulmonary edema, neutrophil infiltration, and TNF-α and IL-6 levels, thus alleviating ALI in LPS-induced septic rats upon RIPC. Collectively, serum-derived EVs-loaded miR-142-5p downregulated PTEN and activated PI3K/Akt to inhibit ALI in sepsis following RIPC, thus highlighting potential therapeutic molecular targets against ALI in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Relationship between impaired BMP signalling and clinical risk factors at early-stage vascular injury in the preterm infant</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35580897/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic lung disease, that is, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication in preterm infants and develops as a consequence of the misguided formation of the gas-exchange area undergoing prenatal and postnatal injury. Subsequent vascular disease and its progression into pulmonary arterial hypertension critically determines long-term outcome in the BPD infant but lacks identification of early, disease-defining changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We link impaired bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling to the earliest onset of vascular pathology in the human preterm lung and delineate the specific effects of the most prevalent prenatal and postnatal clinical risk factors for lung injury mimicking clinically relevant conditions in a multilayered animal model using wild-type and transgenic neonatal mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrate (1) the significant reduction in BMP receptor 2 (BMPR2) expression at the onset of vascular pathology in the lung of preterm infants, later mirrored by reduced plasma BMP protein levels in infants with developing BPD, (2) the rapid impairment (and persistent change) of BMPR2 signalling on postnatal exposure to hyperoxia and mechanical ventilation, aggravated by prenatal cigarette smoke in a preclinical mouse model and (3) a link to defective alveolar septation and matrix remodelling through platelet derived growth factor-receptor alpha deficiency. In a treatment approach, we partially reversed vascular pathology by BMPR2-targeted treatment with FK506 in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We identified impaired BMP signalling as a hallmark of early vascular disease in the injured neonatal lung while outlining its promising potential as a future biomarker or therapeutic target in this growing, high-risk patient population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting SNORA38B attenuates tumorigenesis and sensitizes immune checkpoint blockade in non-small cell lung cancer by remodeling the tumor microenvironment via regulation of GAB2/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35577506/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), are widely involved in the physiological and pathological processes of human beings. While up to date, although considerable progress has been achieved in ncRNA-related pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the underlying mechanisms and biological significance of snoRNAs in NSCLC still need to be further clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or RNAscope was performed to verify the expression of Small Nucleolar RNA, H/ACA Box 38B (SNORA38B) in NSCLC cell lines or clinical samples. BALB/c nude mice xenograft model or C57BL/6J mice syngeneic tumor model were estimated to detect the effects of SNORA38B in tumor growth or tumor immune microenvironment in vivo. Cytometry by time of flight, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry assay were conducted to clarify the effects and mechanisms of SNORA38B-mediated tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The binding activity between SNORA38B and E2F transcription factor 1(E2F1) was detected by RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays. Then, bioinformatics analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation were utilized to demonstrate the regulation of GRB2-associated-binding protein 2 (GAB2) by E2F1. Moreover, the combinatorial treatment of SNORA38B locked nucleic acid (LNA) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) was used to treat murine Lewis lung carcinoma-derived tumor burden C57BL/6J mice to clarify the effectiveness of targeting SNORA38B in NSCLC immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; SNORA38B was found highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and associated with worse prognosis. Further results showed that SNORA38B functioned as an oncogene via facilitating cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and inhibiting cell apoptosis in vitro and promoting tumorigenesis of NSCLC cells in vivo. SNORA38B could also recruit the CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells by triggering tumor cells to secrete interleukin 10, which in turn reduced the infiltration of CD3+CD8+ T cells in NSCLC tumor microenvironment (TME), favoring tumor progression and poorer immune efficacy. Mechanistically, SNORA38B mainly distributed in the nucleus, and promoted NSCLC progression by regulating GAB2 transcription to activate protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway through directly binding with E2F1. Moreover, we found that SNORA38B LNAs were able to ameliorate CD3+CD8+ T cell infiltration in TME, which sensitized NSCLC to the treatment of ICB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In conclusion, our data demonstrated that SNORA38B functioned as an oncogene in NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo at least in part by regulating the GAB2/AKT/mTOR pathway via directly binding to E2F1. SNORA38B could also sensitize NSCLC to immunotherapy, which may be a critical therapeutic target for NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comparative whole-genome transcriptome analysis in renal cell populations reveals high tissue specificity of MAPK/ERK targets in embryonic kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35550069/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; MAPK/ERK signaling is a well-known mediator of extracellular stimuli controlling intracellular responses to growth factors and mechanical cues. The critical requirement of MAPK/ERK signaling for embryonic stem cell maintenance is demonstrated, but specific functions in progenitor regulation during embryonic development, and in particular kidney development remain largely unexplored. We previously demonstrated MAPK/ERK signaling as a key regulator of kidney growth through branching morphogenesis and normal nephrogenesis where it also regulates progenitor expansion. Here, we performed RNA sequencing-based whole-genome expression analysis to identify transcriptional MAPK/ERK targets in two distinct renal populations: the ureteric bud epithelium and the nephron progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our analysis revealed a large number (5053) of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in nephron progenitors and significantly less (1004) in ureteric bud epithelium, reflecting likely heterogenicity of cell types. The data analysis identified high tissue-specificity, as only a fraction (362) of MAPK/ERK targets are shared between the two tissues. Tissue-specific MAPK/ERK targets participate in the regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism in nephron progenitors, which fail to maintain normal mitochondria numbers in the MAPK/ERK-deficient tissue. In the ureteric bud epithelium, a dramatic decline in progenitor-specific gene expression was detected with a simultaneous increase in differentiation-associated genes, which was not observed in nephron progenitors. Our experiments in the genetic model of MAPK/ERK deficiency provide evidence that MAPK/ERK signaling in the ureteric bud maintains epithelial cells in an undifferentiated state. Interestingly, the transcriptional targets shared between the two tissues studied are over-represented by histone genes, suggesting that MAPK/ERK signaling regulates cell cycle progression and stem cell maintenance through chromosome condensation and nucleosome assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Using tissue-specific MAPK/ERK inactivation and RNA sequencing in combination with experimentation in embryonic kidneys, we demonstrate here that MAPK/ERK signaling maintains ureteric bud tip cells, suggesting a regulatory role in collecting duct progenitors. We additionally deliver new mechanistic information on how MAPK/ERK signaling regulates progenitor maintenance through its effects on chromatin accessibility and energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sipeimine ameliorates PM2.5-induced lung injury by inhibiting ferroptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway: A network pharmacology approach</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35567927/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 exposure can cause lung injury and a large number of respiratory disorders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sipeimine ameliorated lung injury caused by PM2.5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sipeimine decreased ferroptosis in type II alveolar epithelial cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effects of sipeimine were mediated through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure can cause lung injury and a large number of respiratory diseases. Sipeimine is a steroidal alkaloid isolated from Fritillaria roylei which has been associated with anti-inflammatory, antitussive and antiasthmatic properties. In this study, we explored the potential effects of sipeimine against PM2.5-induced lung injury in Sprague Dawley rats. Sipeimine alleviated lung injury caused by PM2.5 and decreased pulmonary edema, inflammation and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In addition, sipeimine upregulated the glutathione (GSH) expression and downregulated the expression of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), tissue iron and malondialdehyde (MDA). The downregulation of proteins involved in ferroptosis, including nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) was reversed by sipeimine. The administration of RSL3, a potent ferroptosis-triggering agent, blocked the effects of sipeimine. Using network pharmacology, we found that the effects of sipeimine were presumably mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway. A PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) blocked the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and reversed the effects of sipeimine. Overall, this study suggested that the protective effect of sipeimine against PM2.5-induced lung injury was mainly mediated through the PI3K/Akt pathway, ultimately leading to a reduction in ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DEAD/H-Box Helicases in Immunity, Inflammation, Cell Differentiation, and Cell Death and Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35626643/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEAD/H-box proteins are the largest family of RNA helicases in mammalian genomes, and they are present in all kingdoms of life. Since their discovery in the late 1980s, DEAD/H-box family proteins have been a major focus of study. They have been found to play central roles in RNA metabolism, gene expression, signal transduction, programmed cell death, and the immune response to bacterial and viral infections. Aberrant functions of DEAD/H-box proteins have been implicated in a wide range of human diseases that include cancer, neurodegeneration, and inherited genetic disorders. In this review, we provide a historical context and discuss the molecular functions of DEAD/H-box proteins, highlighting the recent discoveries linking their dysregulation to human diseases. We will also discuss the state of knowledge regarding two specific DEAD/H-box proteins that have critical roles in immune responses and programmed cell death, DDX3X and DDX58, also known as RIG-I. Given their importance in homeostasis and disease, an improved understanding of DEAD/H-box protein biology and protein-protein interactions will be critical for informing strategies to counteract the pathogenesis associated with several human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The gut microbiota prime systemic antiviral immunity via the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35545033/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppression of gut microbiota renders mice susceptible to systemic viral infections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gut microbiota drive systemic antiviral immunity via IFN-I priming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbiota-driven IFN-I priming involves the cGAS-STING axis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbiota mediate systemic IFN-I priming via DNA-containing membrane vesicles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbiota are vital for immune homeostasis and provide a competitive barrier to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Here, we investigated how gut commensals modulate systemic immunity and response to viral infection. Antibiotic suppression of the gut microbiota reduced systemic tonic type I interferon (IFN-I) and antiviral priming. The microbiota-driven tonic IFN-I-response was dependent on cGAS-STING but not on TLR signaling or direct host-bacteria interactions. Instead, membrane vesicles (MVs) from extracellular bacteria activated the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis by delivering bacterial DNA into distal host cells. DNA-containing MVs from the gut microbiota were found in circulation and promoted the clearance of both DNA (herpes simplex virus type 1) and RNA (vesicular stomatitis virus) viruses in a cGAS-dependent manner. In summary, this study establishes an important role for the microbiota in peripheral cGAS-STING activation, which promotes host resistance to systemic viral infections. Moreover, it uncovers an underappreciated risk of antibiotic use during viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting DCLK1 overcomes 5-fluorouracil resistance in colorectal cancer through inhibiting CCAR1/β-catenin pathway-mediated cancer stemness</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35522902/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35522902/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; To date, 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is very important for locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). However, chemotherapy resistance results in tumor recurrence and metastasis, which is a major obstacle for treatment of CRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In the current research, we establish 5-fluorouracil resistant cell lines and explore the potential targets associated with 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC. Moreover, we perform clinical specimen research, in vitro and in vivo experiments and molecular mechanism research, to reveal the biological effects and the mechanism of DCLK1 promoting 5-fluorouracil resistance, and to clarify the potential clinical value of DCLK1 as a target of 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We discover that doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), a cancer stem cell maker, is correlated with 5-fluorouracil resistance, and functionally promotes cancer stemness and 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC. Mechanistically, we elucidate that DCLK1 interacts with cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) through the C-terminal domain, and phosphorylates CCAR1 at the Ser343 site, which is essential for CCAR1 stabilisation. Moreover, we find that DCLK1 positively regulates β-catenin signalling via CCAR1, which is responsible for maintaining cancer stemness. Subsequently, we prove that blocking β-catenin inhibits DCLK1-mediated 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that DCLK1 inhibitor could block CCAR1/β-catenin pathway-mediated cancer stemness and consequently suppresses 5-fluorouracil resistant CRC cells in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, our findings reveal that DCLK1 promotes 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC by CCAR1/β-catenin pathway-mediated cancer stemness, and suggest that targeting DCLK1 might be a promising method to eliminate cancer stem cells for overcoming 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follistatin (FS)-like 1 (FSTL1) is a member of the FS-SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) family of secreted and extracellular matrix proteins. The functions of FSTL1 have been studied in heart and lung injury as well as in wound healing; however, the role of FSTL1 in the kidney is largely unknown. Here, we show using single-cell RNA-Seq that Fstl1 was enriched in stromal cells in obstructed mouse kidneys. In addition, immunofluorescence demonstrated that FSTL1 expression was induced in fibroblasts during kidney fibrogenesis in mice and human patients. We demonstrate that FSTL1 overexpression increased renal fibrosis and activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, known to promote kidney fibrosis, but not the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), Notch, Hedgehog, or Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathways in obstructed mouse kidneys, whereas inhibition of FSTL1 lowered Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Importantly, we show that FSTL1 interacted with Wnt ligands and the Frizzled (FZD) receptors but not the coreceptor lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). Specifically, we found FSTL1 interacted with Wnt3a through its extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain and von Willebrand factor type C-like (VWC) domain, and with FZD4 through its EC domain. Furthermore, we show that FSTL1 increased the association of Wnt3a with FZD4 and promoted Wnt/β-catenin signaling and fibrogenesis. The EC domain interacting with both Wnt3a and FZD4 also enhanced Wnt3a signaling. Therefore, we conclude that FSTL1 is a novel extracellular enhancer of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Few studies reported the therapeutic effect of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) in lung inflammatory diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory role and underlying molecular in cadmium-induced lung injury have been poorly understood, directly linked to chronic lung diseases (CLDs): chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer etc. Therefore, in this study we aim to investigate the therapeutic activities of water extract of KRG (KRG-WE) in mouse cadmium-induced lung injury model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Method:&lt;/em&gt; The anti-inflammatory roles and underlying mechanisms of KRG-WE were evaluated in vitro under cadmium-stimulated lung epithelial cells (A549) and HEK293T cell line and in vivo in cadmium-induced lung injury mouse model using semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), luciferase assay, immunoblotting, and FACS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; KRG-WE strongly ameliorated the symptoms of CdSO4-induced lung injury in mice according to total cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and severity scores as well as cytokine levels. KRG-WE significantly suppressed the upregulation of inflammatory signaling comprising mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and their upstream enzymes. In in vitro study, KRG-WE suppressed expression of interleukin (IL)-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and IL-8 while promoting recovery in CdSO4-treated A549 cells. Similarly, KRG-WE reduced phosphorylation of MAPK and c-Jun/c-Fos in cadmium-exposed A549 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; KRG-WE was found to attenuate symptoms of cadmium-induced lung injury and reduce the expression of inflammatory genes by suppression of MAPK/AP-1-mediated pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hydnocarpin D attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via MAPK/NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35537248/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a complex pulmonary destructive disease with limited therapeutic approaches. Hydnocarpin D (HD) is a flavonolignan isolated from Hydnocarpus wightiana which possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether HD has beneficial effects on ALI as well as its underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study evaluated the protective effect of HD in ALI and the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, the role of HD on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice was tested by determination of neutrophil infiltration, levels of inflammatory cytokines, lung histology and edema, vascular and alveolar barrier disruption. In vitro, murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms RESULTS: Administration of HD protected mice against LPS-induced ALI, including ameliorating the histological alterations in the lung tissues, and decreasing lung edema, protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, infiltration of inflammatory cell and secretion of cytokines. Moreover, HD blocked the phosphorylation of TLR-4, NF-κB, and ERK in LPS-induced lung injury. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, HD inhibited LPS-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells, which largely depend upon the upregulation of antioxidant defensive Nrf2 pathway, thereby suppressing LPS-activated proinflammatory mediator secretion, NLRP3 inflammasome, and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; HD attenuates oxidative stress and inflammation against LPS-induced ALI via MAPK/NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, and is a promising novel therapeutic candidate for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influenza A virus NS1 protein hijacks YAP/TAZ to suppress TLR3-mediated innate immune response</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35503798/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hippo signaling pathway, which is historically considered as a dominator of organ development and homeostasis has recently been implicated as an immune regulator. However, its role in host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) has not been widely investigated. Here, we found that IAV could activate the Hippo effectors Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) through physical binding of the IAV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) with C-terminal domain of YAP/TAZ, facilitating their nuclear location. Meanwhile, YAP/TAZ downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral cytokines against IAV infection, therefore benefiting virus replication and host cell apoptosis. A mouse model of IAV infection further demonstrated Yap deficiency protected mice against IAV infection, relieving lung injury. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ blocked anti-viral innate immune signaling via downregulation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) expression. YAP directly bound to the putative TEADs binding site on the promoter region of TLR3. The elimination of acetylated histone H3 occupancy in the TLR3 promoter resulted in its transcriptional silence. Moreover, treatment of Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor or disruption of HDAC4/6 reversed the inhibition of TLR3 expression by YAP/TAZ, suggesting HDAC4/6 mediated the suppression function of YAP/TAZ. Taken together, we uncovered a novel immunomodulatory mechanism employed by IAV, where YAP/TAZ antagonize TLR3-mediated innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel β-catenin/BCL9 complex inhibitor blocks oncogenic Wnt signaling and disrupts cholesterol homeostasis in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35486727/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of many human cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), making it an attractive clinical target. With the aim of inhibiting oncogenic Wnt activity, we developed a high-throughput screening AlphaScreen assay to identify selective small-molecule inhibitors of the interaction between β-catenin and its coactivator BCL9. We identified a compound that consistently bound to β-catenin and specifically inhibited in vivo native β-catenin/BCL9 complex formation in CRC cell lines. This compound inhibited Wnt activity, down-regulated expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signature in gene expression studies, disrupted cholesterol homeostasis, and significantly reduced the proliferation of CRC cell lines and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of CRC. This study has therefore identified a specific small-molecule inhibitor of oncogenic Wnt signaling, which may have value as a probe for functional studies and has important implications for the development of novel therapies in patients with CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional genetic screen identifies ITPR3/calcium/RELB axis as a driver of colorectal cancer metastatic liver colonization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of ITPR3 in colorectal cancer cells inhibits metastatic liver colonization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RELB acts downstream of ITPR3/calcium to promote colorectal cancer liver metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITPR3 and RELB regulate survival in response to hypoxia and substratum detachment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure of colorectal cancer cells to ITPR3 inhibitor caffeine reduces liver metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metastatic colonization is the primary cause of death from colorectal cancer (CRC). We employed genome-scale in vivo short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening and validation to identify 26 promoters of CRC liver colonization. Among these genes, we identified a cluster that contains multiple targetable genes, including ITPR3, which promoted liver-metastatic colonization and elicited similar downstream gene expression programs. ITPR3 is a caffeine-sensitive inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor that releases calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and enhanced metastatic colonization by inducing expression of RELB, a transcription factor that is associated with non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Genetic, cell biological, pharmacologic, and clinical association studies revealed that ITPR3 and RELB drive CRC colony formation by promoting cell survival upon substratum detachment or hypoxic exposure. RELB was sufficient to drive colonization downstream of ITPR3. Our findings implicate the ITPR3/calcium/RELB axis in CRC metastatic colony formation and uncover multiple clinico-pathologically associated targetable proteins as drivers of CRC metastatic colonization.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TLR2/caspase-5/Panx1 pathway mediates necrosis-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages during acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35473933/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by necroinflammation formed by necrotic tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and interstitial inflammation. In necroinflammation, macrophages are key inflammatory cells and can be activated and polarized into proinflammatory macrophages. Membranous Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can cooperate with intracellular NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) to recognize danger signals from necrotic TECs and activate proinflammatory macrophages by assembling NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the cooperation between TLRs and NLRP3 is still unclear. Using conditioned medium from necrotic TECs, we confirmed that necrotic TECs could release danger signals to activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. We further identified that necrotic TECs-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation was dependent on ATP secretion via Pannexin-1 (Panx1) channel in macrophages. Next, we verified that TLR2 was required for the activation of Panx1 and NLRP3 in macrophages. Mechanistically, we indicated that caspase-5 mediated TLR2-induced Panx1 activation. In addition, we showed that necrotic TECs-induced activation of TLR2/caspase-5/Panx1 axis could be decreased in macrophages when TECs was protected by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Overall, we demonstrate that danger signals from necrotic TECs could activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages via TLR2/caspase-5/Panx1 axis during AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cineole alleviates the BPA-inhibited NETs formation by regulating the p38 pathway-mediated programmed cell death</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35483150/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPA inhibited the release of NETs by inducing necroptosis and apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CIN can alleviate the oxidative stress and programmed cell death induced by BPA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CIN via p38 pathway alleviates BPA-induced neutrophil injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enriched the research on toxicology of BPA and detoxification mechanism of CIN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor, that can cause immune dysfunction. Cineole (CIN) has that effect of regulating immune function and resist oxidation. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are one of the ways to resist pathogen invasion. In order to explore the effects of BPA and CIN on the release of chicken NETs and the antagonistic effect of CIN, take chicken peripheral blood neutrophils as object of study, grouping as NC, CIN, BPA + CIN and BPA. SEM, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, Western-blot and other methods were used to detect related indicators. The results showed that BPA inhibited the activities of GPX, SOD and CAT, increased the contents of MDA and NO, increased the activity of iNOS. BPA exposure inhibited the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE) and histone, and inhibited the release of NETs. BPA activated downstream apoptosis and necroptosis through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) pathway, which increased the expression of cytochrome C (CytC), bcl-2 associated K protein gene (bak), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3 (caspase-3), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 9 (caspase-9), receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), decreased the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2). However, the co-exposure of CIN and BPA partially recovered the release of NETs, alleviated BPA-induced oxidative stress, and inhibited the activation of p38-MAPK pathway, necroptosis, and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. These results indicated that CIN modulated p38 pathway alleviated BPA-induced neutrophil necroptosis and apoptosis, and increased NETs formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin alleviates LPS-induced lung injury and edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin prolongs the survival rates of mice suffered from lethal doses of LPS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin attenuates NLRP3/GADMD pathway-driven pyroptosis via inhibiting oxidative stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin inhibits LPS-induced ALI through regulating the feasible interactions between Nrf2 signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/ acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is featured by intensive inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, which lead to cytokine storms and pyroptosis. Here, we aimed to investigate whether melatonin was capable of alleviating LPS-induced ALI via activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 (Nrf2/HO-1) signaling axis and inhibiting pyroptosis. Mice were injected with melatonin (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for consecutive five days before LPS instillation intratracheally, and human alveolar epithelial cell (AECⅡ) A549 cell lines and murine macrophages Raw264.7 cell lines were pretreated with melatonin (400 μM) before LPS (10 μg/ml) stimulation. The result demonstrated that LPS induced obvious lung injury characterized by alveolar damage, neutrophil infiltration and lung edema as well as the reduction of the survival rate of mice, which were totally reversed by melatonin pretreatment. Mechanistically, melatonin pretreatment activated nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor (Nrf) 2 signaling, subsequently, drove antioxidant pathways including significant increases in the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, Mn-SOD and Catalase in vivo and in vitro. Simultaneously, melatonin inhibited ROS and MDA overproduction, iNOS expression as well as TNF-α and IL-1β expression and release. Furthermore, melatonin inhibited LPS-induced pyroptosis by reversing the overexpression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18 and GSDMD-N, as well as LDH release and TUNEL-positive cells in A549 cells and Raw264.7 cells. Overall, the current study suggests that melatonin exerts protective roles on LPS-induced ALI and pyroptosis by inhibiting NLRP3-GSDMD pathway via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein fatty acylation regulates numerous cell signaling pathways. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) exert a plethora of physiological effects, including cell signaling regulation, with underlying mechanisms to be fully understood. Herein, we report that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) regulate PI3K-AKT signaling by modifying PDK1 and AKT2. DHA-administered mice exhibit altered phosphorylation of proteins in signaling pathways. Methylene bridge-containing DHA/EPA acylate δ1 carbon of tryptophan 448/543 in PDK1 and tryptophan 414 in AKT2 via free radical pathway, recruit both the proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane, and activate PI3K signaling and glucose uptake in a tryptophan acylation-dependent but insulin-independent manner in cultured cells and in mice. DHA/EPA deplete cytosolic PDK1 and AKT2 and induce insulin resistance. Akt2 knockout in mice abrogates DHA/EPA-induced PI3K-AKT signaling. Our results identify PUFA’s methylene bridge tryptophan acylation, a protein fatty acylation that regulates cell signaling and may underlie multifaceted effects of methylene-bridge-containing PUFAs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Molecular Mechanism of Long Non-Coding RNA (LncRNA) Regulation of Notch Signaling in Glucose-Induced Apoptosis of Human Retinal Vascular Endothelial Cell</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35715905/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetes, a global health concern, affects the health of more than 500 million adults. The absence of Notch protein can cause an imbalance in the retinal vascular environment and cause retinal vascular disease. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is known to be involved in the regulation of many signaling pathways. We hope to understand the specific mechanism of apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells (RVECs) by exploring the regulatory effect of lncRNA on the Notch pathway. In this study, we found that RVECs treated with glucose showed increased levels of Notch transcript and protein expression. The lentiviral interference with Notch RNAi reversed this response. When Notch activity decreased, oxidative stress also decreased, accompanied by increased levels of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 and an increased rate of apoptosis. Therefore, we believe that Notch is involved in the development of diabetic retinopathy and loss of expression promotes apoptosis of human RVECs. By inhibiting the Notch pathway, lncRNA promotes apoptosis of human RVECs in a high-glucose environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Low-dose metformin targets the lysosomal AMPK pathway through PEN2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35197629/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metformin, the most prescribed antidiabetic medicine, has shown other benefits such as anti-ageing and anticancer effects. For clinical doses of metformin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a major role in its mechanism of action; however, the direct molecular target of metformin remains unknown. Here we show that clinically relevant concentrations of metformin inhibit the lysosomal proton pump v-ATPase, which is a central node for AMPK activation following glucose starvation. We synthesize a photoactive metformin probe and identify PEN2, a subunit of γ-secretase, as a binding partner of metformin with a dissociation constant at micromolar levels. Metformin-bound PEN2 forms a complex with ATP6AP1, a subunit of the v-ATPase, which leads to the inhibition of v-ATPase and the activation of AMPK without effects on cellular AMP levels. Knockout of PEN2 or re-introduction of a PEN2 mutant that does not bind ATP6AP1 blunts AMPK activation. In vivo, liver-specific knockout of Pen2 abolishes metformin-mediated reduction of hepatic fat content, whereas intestine-specific knockout of Pen2 impairs its glucose-lowering effects. Furthermore, knockdown of pen-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans abrogates metformin-induced extension of lifespan. Together, these findings reveal that metformin binds PEN2 and initiates a signalling route that intersects, through ATP6AP1, the lysosomal glucose-sensing pathway for AMPK activation. This ensures that metformin exerts its therapeutic benefits in patients without substantial adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of Klotho, an anti-aging protein, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney diseases. As Klotho is a large transmembrane protein, it is challenging to harness it as a therapeutic remedy. Here we report the discovery of a Klotho-derived peptide 1 (KP1) protecting kidneys by targeting TGF-β signaling. By screening a series of peptides derived from human Klotho protein, we identified KP1 that repressed fibroblast activation by binding to TGF-β receptor 2 (TβR2) and disrupting the TGF-β/TβR2 engagement. As such, KP1 blocked TGF-β-induced activation of Smad2/3 and mitogen-activated protein kinases. In mouse models of renal fibrosis, intravenous injection of KP1 resulted in its preferential accumulation in injured kidneys. KP1 preserved kidney function, repressed TGF-β signaling, ameliorated renal fibrosis and restored endogenous Klotho expression. Together, our findings suggest that KP1 recapitulates the anti-fibrotic action of Klotho and offers a potential remedy in the fight against fibrotic kidney diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The deubiquitinase OTUD1 inhibits colonic inflammation by suppressing RIPK1-mediated NF-κB signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34876703/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3)-mediated ubiquitination and deubiquitinase (DUB)-mediated deubiquitination processes are closely associated with the occurrence and development of colonic inflammation. Ovarian tumor deubiquitinase 1 (OTUD1) is involved in immunoregulatory functions linked to infectious diseases. However, the effect of OTUD1 on intestinal immune responses during colonic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unclear. Here, we show that loss of OTUD1 in mice contributes to the pathogenesis of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis via excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that OTUD1 in hematopoietic cells plays a dominant role in protection against colitis. Mechanistically, OTUD1 physically interacts with receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and selectively cleaves K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIPK1 to inhibit the recruitment of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO). Moreover, the expression of OTUD1 in mucosa samples from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients was lower than that in mucosa samples from healthy controls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the UC-associated OTUD1 G430V mutation abolishes the ability of OTUD1 to inhibit RIPK1-mediated NF-κB activation and intestinal inflammation. Taken together, our study unveils a previously unexplored role of OTUD1 in moderating intestinal inflammation by inhibiting RIPK1-mediated NF-κB activation, suggesting that the OTUD1-RIPK1 axis could be a potential target for the treatment of IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of clinical pulmonary edema and contributes to the development of acute lung injury (ALI). Here we reported that ruscogenin (RUS), an effective steroidal sapogenin of Radix Ophiopogon japonicus, attenuated lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced pulmonary endothelial barrier disruption through mediating non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMMHC IIA)‒Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) interactions. By in vivo and in vitro experiments, we observed that RUS administration significantly ameliorated LPS-triggered pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction and ALI. Moreover, we identified that RUS directly targeted NMMHC IIA on its N-terminal and head domain by serial affinity chromatography, molecular docking, biolayer interferometry, and microscale thermophoresis analyses. Downregulation of endothelial NMMHC IIA expression in vivo and in vitro abolished the protective effect of RUS. It was also observed that NMMHC IIA was dissociated from TLR4 and then activating TLR4 downstream Src/vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) signaling in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells after LPS treatment, which could be restored by RUS. Collectively, these findings provide pharmacological evidence showing that RUS attenuates LPS-induced pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction by inhibiting TLR4/Src/VE-cadherin pathway through targeting NMMHC IIA and mediating NMMHC IIA‒TLR4 interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Artemether confers neuroprotection on cerebral ischemic injury through stimulation of the Erk1/2-P90rsk-CREB signaling pathway</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artemether conferred neuroprotection in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artemether conferred neuroprotection on oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion-induced cell injury model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artemether promoted the activation of Erk1/2-P90&lt;sup&gt;rsk&lt;/sup&gt;-CREB signaling pathway &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability among adults. Despite the economic burden of the disease, available treatment options are still very limited. With the exception of anti-thrombolytics and hypothermia, current therapies fail to reduce neuronal injury, neurological deficits and mortality rates, suggesting that the development of novel and more effective therapies against ischemic stroke is urgent. In the present study, we found that artemether, which has been used in the clinic as an anti-malarial drug, was able to improve the neurological deficits, attenuate the infarction volume and the brain water content in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal model. Furthermore, artemether treatment significantly suppressed cell apoptosis, stimulated cell proliferation and promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), P90&lt;sup&gt;rsk&lt;/sup&gt; and cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB). Artemether protective effect was attenuated by PD98059, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, administration. Similarly, in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/RP) cell models, artemether pre-treatment induced the suppression of the intracellular ROS, the down-regulation of LDH activity, the reduction of caspase 3 activity and of the apoptosis cell rate and reversed the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. As with MCAO animal model, artemether promoted the activation of Erk1/2-P90&lt;sup&gt;rsk&lt;/sup&gt;-CREB signaling pathway. This effect was blocked by the inhibition or knock-down of ERK1/2. The present study provides evidences of the neuroprotective effect of artemether unravelling its potential as a new therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refractory diabetic wounds can cause persistent inflammation and delayed healing due to hypoxia. Currently, no optimal solution is available. Exosomes of adipose stem cells (ADSCs-exo) may promote skin wound healing, however, molecular mechanisms remains mysterious. We found significantly enhanced survival and proliferation of adipose stem cells after hypoxia induction compared to normoxia. Here, we aimed to investigate if hypoxic adipose stem cells exosomes (HypADSCs-exo) participate in hypoxia adaptability and accelerate diabetic wound healing. Based on high-throughput sequencing, 215 microRNAs (miRNAs) were upregulated and 369 miRNAs downregulated in HypADSCs-exo compared to ADSCs-exo. Up-regulated miR-21-3p, miR-126-5p, miR-31-5p whereas down-regulated gene miR-99b and miR-146-a correlated with wound healing. According to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), miRNAs might regulate cell metabolism, differentiation and Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) function. Consistently, HpyADSCs-exo could promote diabetic wounds healing and inhibit inflammation through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Collectively, HpyADSCs-exo can promote diabetic wound healing as an alternative strategy to improve wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 9 (PARP9) as a noncanonical sensor for RNA virus in dendritic cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33976210/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate immune cells are critical in protective immunity against viral infections, involved in sensing foreign viral nucleic acids. Here we report that the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 9 (PARP9), a member of PARP family, serves as a non-canonical sensor for RNA virus to initiate and amplify type I interferon (IFN) production. We find knockdown or deletion of PARP9 in human or mouse dendritic cells and macrophages inhibits type I IFN production in response to double strand RNA stimulation or RNA virus infection. Furthermore, mice deficient for PARP9 show enhanced susceptibility to infections with RNA viruses because of the impaired type I IFN production. Mechanistically, we show that PARP9 recognizes and binds viral RNA, with resultant recruitment and activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT3 pathway, independent of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS). PI3K/AKT3 then activates the IRF3 and IRF7 by phosphorylating IRF3 at Ser385 and IRF7 at Ser437/438 mediating type I IFN production. Together, we reveal a critical role for PARP9 as a non-canonical RNA sensor that depends on the PI3K/AKT3 pathway to produce type I IFN. These findings may have important clinical implications in controlling viral infections and viral-induced diseases by targeting PARP9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered the roots of cancer metastasis and recurrence (CSCs), due in part to their self-renewal and therapy resistance properties. However, the underlying mechanisms for the regulation of CSC stemness are poorly understood. Recently, increasing evidence shows that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators for cancer cell function in various malignancies including breast cancer, but how lncRNAs regulate the function of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) remains to be determined. Herein, using lncRNA/mRNA microarray assays, a novel lncRNA (named lnc030) is identified, which is highly expressed in BCSCs in vitro and in vivo, as a pivotal regulator in maintaining BCSC stemness and promoting tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, lnc030 cooperates with poly(rC) binding protein 2(PCBP2) to stabilize squalene epoxidase (SQLE) mRNA, resulting in an increase of cholesterol synthesis. The increased cholesterol in turn actives PI3K/Akt signaling, which governs BCSC stemness. In summary, these findings demonstrate that a new, lnc030-based mechanism for regulating cholesterol synthesis and stemness properties of BCSCs. The lnc030-SQLE-cholesterol synthesis pathway may serve as an effective therapeutic target for BCSC elimination and breast cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corrigendum to Zhao Y, Wang C, Hong X, et al. &lt;a href=&#34;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0085253822006226&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wnt/β-catenin signaling mediates both heart and kidney injury in type 2 cardiorenal syndrome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In type 2 cardiorenal syndrome, chronic heart failure is thought to cause or promote chronic kidney disease; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the role of Wnt signaling in heart and kidney injury in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). At 8 weeks after TAC, cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis were prominent, and echocardiography confirmed impaired cardiac function. The cardiac lesions were accompanied by upregulation of multiple Wnt ligands and activation of β-catenin, as well as activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Wnt3a induced multiple components of the RAS in primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. TAC also caused proteinuria and kidney fibrosis, accompanied by klotho depletion and β-catenin activation in the kidney. Pharmacologic blockade of β-catenin with a small molecule inhibitor or the RAS with losartan ameliorated cardiac injury, restored heart function, and mitigated the renal lesions. Serum from TAC mice was sufficient to activate β-catenin and trigger tubular cell injury in vitro, indicating a role for circulating factors. Multiple inflammatory cytokines were upregulated in the circulation of TAC mice, and tumor necrosis factor-α was able to inhibit klotho, induce β-catenin activation, and cause tubular cell injury in vitro. These studies identify Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a common pathogenic mediator of heart and kidney injury in type 2 cardiorenal syndrome after TAC. Targeting this pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy to protect both organs in cardiorenal syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rapid evolution and conserved function of the piRNA pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transposons are major genome constituents that can mobilize and trigger mutations, DNA breaks and chromosome rearrangements. Transposon silencing is particularly important in the germline, which is dedicated to transmission of the inherited genome. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) guide a host defence system that transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally silences transposons during germline development. While germline control of transposons by the piRNA pathway is conserved, many piRNA pathway genes are evolving rapidly under positive selection, and the piRNA biogenesis machinery shows remarkable phylogenetic diversity. Conservation of core function combined with rapid gene evolution is characteristic of a host-pathogen arms race, suggesting that transposons and the piRNA pathway are engaged in an evolutionary tug of war that is driving divergence of the biogenesis machinery. Recent studies suggest that this process may produce biochemical incompatibilities that contribute to reproductive isolation and species divergence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transcriptional regulator STAT3 has key roles in vertebrate development and mature tissue function including control of inflammation and immunity. Mutations in human STAT3 associate with diseases such as immunodeficiency, autoimmunity and cancer. Strikingly, however, either hyperactivation or inactivation of STAT3 results in human disease, indicating tightly regulated STAT3 function is central to health. Here, we attempt to summarize information on the numerous and distinct biological actions of STAT3, and highlight recent discoveries, with a specific focus on STAT3 function in the immune and hematopoietic systems. Our goal is to spur investigation on mechanisms by which aberrant STAT3 function drives human disease and novel approaches that might be used to modulate disease outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of STAT3 in autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/25951043/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process in eukaryotes that eliminates harmful components and maintains cellular homeostasis in response to a series of extracellular insults. However, these insults may trigger the downstream signaling of another prominent stress responsive pathway, the STAT3 signaling pathway, which has been implicated in multiple aspects of the autophagic process. Recent reports further indicate that different subcellular localization patterns of STAT3 affect autophagy in various ways. For example, nuclear STAT3 fine-tunes autophagy via the transcriptional regulation of several autophagy-related genes such as BCL2 family members, BECN1, PIK3C3, CTSB, CTSL, PIK3R1, HIF1A, BNIP3, and microRNAs with targets of autophagy modulators. Cytoplasmic STAT3 constitutively inhibits autophagy by sequestering EIF2AK2 as well as by interacting with other autophagy-related signaling molecules such as FOXO1 and FOXO3. Additionally, the mitochondrial translocation of STAT3 suppresses autophagy induced by oxidative stress and may effectively preserve mitochondria from being degraded by mitophagy. Understanding the role of STAT3 signaling in the regulation of autophagy may provide insight into the classic autophagy model and also into cancer therapy, especially for the emerging targeted therapy, because a series of targeted agents execute antitumor activities via blocking STAT3 signaling, which inevitably affects the autophagy pathway. Here, we review several of the representative studies and the current understanding in this particular field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a point of convergence for numerous oncogenic signaling pathways, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is central in regulating the anti-tumor immune response. STAT3 is broadly hyperactivated both in cancer and non-cancerous cells within the tumor ecosystem and plays important roles in inhibiting the expression of crucial immune activation regulators and promoting the production of immunosuppressive factors. Therefore, targeting the STAT3 signaling pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for numerous cancers. In this review, we outline the importance of STAT3 signaling pathway in tumorigenesis and its immune regulation, and highlight the current status for the development of STAT3-targeting therapeutic approaches. We also summarize and discuss recent advances in STAT3-based combination immunotherapy in detail. These endeavors provide new insights into the translational application of STAT3 in cancer and may contribute to the promotion of more effective treatments toward malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pirfenidone ameliorates early pulmonary fibrosis in LPS-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome by inhibiting endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition via the Hedgehog signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35504205/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pirfenidone(PFD) treatment can inhibit the progress of pulmonary fibrosis and notably reduce the mortality of ARDS mice in early stage of ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PFD reduces early pulmonary fibrosis stimulated by LPS, which is related to the inhibition of EndMT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PFD may ameliorate LPS-induced ARDS by regulating the HH signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary vascular endothelial dysfunction is a key pathogenic mechanism in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in fibrosis in lung tissues, including in the context of COVID-19. Pirfenidone (PFD) has become a novel therapeutic agent for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and can improve lung function, inhibit fibrosis and inhibit inflammation. Recently, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) was shown to play a crucial role in various respiratory diseases. However, the role of PFD in the course of EndMT in LPS-induced ARDS remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the anti-EndMT effects of PFD on pulmonary fibrosis after LPS-induced ARDS. First, we determined that PFD significantly reduced LPS-induced ARDS, as shown by significant pathological alterations, and alleviated the oxidative stress and inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, PFD decreased pulmonary fibrosis in LPS-induced ARDS by inhibiting EndMT and reduced the expression levels of Hedgehog (HH) pathway target genes, such as Gli1 and α-SMA, after LPS induction. In summary, this study confirmed that inhibiting the HH pathway by PFD could decrease pulmonary fibrosis by downregulating EndMT in LPS-induced ARDS. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PFD is a promising agent to attenuate pulmonary fibrosis following ARDS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
