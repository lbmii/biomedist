      <title>Pseudouridine-modified tRNA fragments repress aberrant protein synthesis and predict leukaemic progression in myelodysplastic syndrome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are emerging small noncoding RNAs that, although commonly altered in cancer, have poorly defined roles in tumorigenesis1. Here we show that pseudouridylation (Ψ) of a stem cell-enriched tRF subtype2, mini tRFs containing a 5&amp;rsquo; terminal oligoguanine (mTOG), selectively inhibits aberrant protein synthesis programmes, thereby promoting engraftment and differentiation of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Building on evidence that mTOG-Ψ targets polyadenylate-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), we employed isotope exchange proteomics to reveal critical interactions between mTOG and functional RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domains of PABPC1. Mechanistically, this hinders the recruitment of translational co-activator PABPC1-interacting protein 1 (PAIP1)3 and strongly represses the translation of transcripts sharing pyrimidine-enriched sequences (PES) at the 5&amp;rsquo; untranslated region (UTR), including 5&amp;rsquo; terminal oligopyrimidine tracts (TOP) that encode protein machinery components and are frequently altered in cancer4. Significantly, mTOG dysregulation leads to aberrantly increased translation of 5&amp;rsquo; PES messenger RNA (mRNA) in malignant MDS-HSPCs and is clinically associated with leukaemic transformation and reduced patient survival. These findings define a critical role for tRFs and Ψ in difficult-to-treat subsets of MDS characterized by high risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histologically resolved small RNA maps in primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis indicate progressive changes within glomerular and tubulointerstitial regions</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35114200/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathological heterogeneity is common in clinical tissue specimens and complicates the interpretation of molecular data obtained from the specimen. As a typical example, a kidney biopsy specimen often contains glomeruli and tubulointerstitial regions with different levels of histological injury, including some that are histologically normal. We reasoned that the molecular profiles of kidney tissue regions with specific histological injury scores could provide new insights into kidney injury progression. Therefore, we developed a strategy to perform small RNA deep sequencing analysis for individually scored glomerular and tubulointerstitial regions in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded kidney needle biopsies. This approach was applied to study focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), the leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Large numbers of small RNAs, including microRNAs, 3&amp;rsquo;-tRFs, 5&amp;rsquo;-tRFs, and mitochondrial tRFs, were differentially expressed between histologically indistinguishable tissue regions from patients with FSGS and matched healthy controls. A majority of tRFs were upregulated in FSGS. Several small RNAs were differentially expressed between tissue regions with different histological scores in FSGS. Notably, with increasing levels of histological damage, miR-21-5p was upregulated progressively and miR-192-5p was downregulated progressively in glomerular and tubulointerstitial regions, respectively. This study marks the first genome scale molecular profiling conducted in histologically characterized glomerular and tubulointerstitial regions. Thus, substantial molecular changes in histologically normal kidney regions in FSGS might contribute to initiating tissue injury or represent compensatory mechanisms. In addition, several small RNAs might contribute to subsequent progression of glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury, and histologically mapping small RNA profiles may be applied to analyze tissue specimens in any disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dicer dependent tRNA derived small RNAs promote nascent RNA silencing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35048990/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mammalian cells, small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) negatively regulate gene expression in a pathway known as RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi can be categorized into post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), which involves the cleavage of target messenger RNA (mRNA) or inhibition of translation in the cytoplasm, and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), which is mediated by the establishment of repressive epigenetic marks at target loci. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which are essential for translation, can be processed into small ncRNAs, termed tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). The biogenesis of tsRNAs and their role in gene expression regulation has not yet been fully understood. Here, we show that Dicer dependent tsRNAs promote gene silencing through a mechanism distinct from PTGS and TGS. tsRNAs can lead to downregulation of target genes by targeting introns via nascent RNA silencing (NRS) in nuclei. Furthermore, we show that Ago2 slicer activity is required for this mechanism. Synthetic tsRNAs can significantly reduce expression of a target gene at both RNA and protein levels. Target genes regulated by NRS are associated with various diseases, which further underpins its biological significance. Finally, we show that NRS is evolutionarily conserved and has the potential to be explored as a novel synthetic sRNA based therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;
