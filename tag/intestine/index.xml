      <title>Candida albicans can foster gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation during HIV infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt;) is a ubiquitous fungal commensal component of the human microbiota, and under certain circumstances, such as during an immunocompromised state, it may initiate different types of infection. Moreover, &lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt; continuously and reciprocally interacts with the host immune system as well as with other elements of the gut microbiota, thus contributing significantly to both gut homeostasis and host immunity. People living with HIV (PLWH), including those receiving antiretroviral therapy, are characterized by a depletion of CD4+ T-cells and dysbiosis in their gut. &lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt; colonization is frequent in PLWH, causing both a high prevalence and high morbidity. Gut barrier damage and elevated levels of microbial translocation are also fairly common in this population. Herein, we take a closer look at the reciprocity among &lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt;, gut microbiota, HIV, and the host immune system, thus throwing some light on this complex interplay.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NPY methylated ctDNA is a promising biomarker for treatment response monitoring in metastatic colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36716292/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purpose Analysis of methylation markers in liquid biopsies is a promising technique for the follow-up of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients, since they can be used in all patients, regardless of their mutational status. Therefore, we studied the value of NPY methylation analysis in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for accurate response monitoring in mCRC patients in the PANIB trial. Experimental design The PANIB trial was a randomized phase two trial designed to compare FOLFOX plus panitumumab and FOLFOX plus bevacizumab in patients with RAS wild-type unresectable mCRC. The results of sequential liquid biopsies were correlated with results of imaging. Results Forty patients were included from six Belgian hospitals. Analysis of the liquid biopsies revealed that higher baseline levels of methylated ctDNA was associated with a significantly shorter overall survival (HR, 1.015; 95% CI 1.005 -1.025 and p=0.002). Furthermore, thirty-seven patients provided at least two liquid biopsies. Thirty-one of them showed a decrease in the methylation ratio after the start of therapy, which corresponded with stable disease or response on imaging at the first evaluation. When comparing the panitumumab and bevacizumab arm, significantly higher objective response and early tumor shrinkage rates were observed in the panitumumab arm (p=0.048 and p=0.015, respectively). However, due to a small study population, the trial was underpowered to detect a significant difference in survival. Conclusions The results of this study confirm that baseline methylated ctDNA is a prognostic marker and indicate that NPY methylation is a promising marker for response monitoring in patients with mCRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mapping lesion-specific response and progression dynamics and inter-organ variability in metastatic colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36697416/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving systemic tumor control across metastases is vital for long-term patient survival but remains intractable in many patients. High lesion-level response heterogeneity persists, conferring many dissociated responses across metastatic lesions. Most studies of metastatic disease focus on tumor molecular and cellular features, which are crucial to elucidating the mechanisms underlying lesion-level variability. However, our understanding of lesion-specific heterogeneity on the macroscopic level, such as lesion dynamics in growth, response, and progression during treatment, remains rudimentary. This study investigates lesion-specific response heterogeneity through analyzing 116,542 observations of 40,612 lesions in 4,308 metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. Despite significant differences in their response and progression dynamics, metastatic lesions converge on four phenotypes that vary with anatomical site. Importantly, we find that organ-level progression sequence is closely associated with patient long-term survival, and that patients with the first lesion progression in the liver often have worse survival. In conclusion, our study provides insights into lesion-specific response and progression heterogeneity in mCRC and creates impetus for metastasis-specific therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PLZF restricts intestinal ILC3 function in gut defense</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36693920/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) play important roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis by protecting the host from pathogen infections and tissue inflammation. The transcription factor PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger), encoded by zinc finger BTB domain containing 16 (Zbtb16), is highly and transiently expressed in ILC precursors (ILCPs). However, the role of PLZF in regulating ILC3 development and function remains unknown. Here, we show that PLZF was specifically expressed in mature intestinal ILC3s compared with other ILC subsets. PLZF was dispensable for ILC3 development. However, PLZF deficiency in ILC3s resulted in increased innate interleukin-22 (IL-22) secretion and protection against gut infection and inflammation. Mechanistically, PLZF negatively regulated IL-22 expression by ILC3s in a cell-intrinsic manner by binding to the IL-22 promoter region for transcriptional repression. Together, our data suggest that PLZF restricts intestinal ILC3 function to regulate gut immune homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The temporal characteristics of the disruption of gut microbiota, serum metabolome, and cytokines by silica exposure in wistar rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36706523/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silica exposure causes impaired lung function and lung tissue damage in wistar rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At different stages, the changes of intestinal microflora in rats were different after silica exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serum metabolites and disrupted multiple metabolic pathways differed after varied silica exposure exposure duration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The inflammation-metabolite-gut microbiota interaction axis varies at different stages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicosis is one of the most frequent, rapidly developing, and lethal types of pneumoconiosis. However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of its pathogenesis and progress remains unclear. We investigated the fundamental processes of silicosis incidence and progression using a combination of lung function testing, histopathology, 16 S rRNA, untargeted metabolomics, and cytokine chips at different exposure times (4 or 8 weeks). The results show that silica exposure damages lung tissue reduces lung function, and increases with time. Cytokines with time-specific properties were found in lung lavage fluid: IFN-γ (4 weeks; _P_＜0.05), TNF-α, M-CSF, GM-CSF (8 weeks; _P_＜0.01). In addition, silica exposure for different periods interferes to varying degrees with the metabolism of lipids. The composition of the intestinal microbiota changed with increasing exposure time and there were time-specific: &lt;em&gt;Allobaculum&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/em&gt;、 &lt;em&gt;Jeotgalicoccu&lt;/em&gt;、 &lt;em&gt;Coprococcus 1&lt;/em&gt; (4 weeks; _P_＜0.05), &lt;em&gt;Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group&lt;/em&gt;、 &lt;em&gt;Ruminiclostridium 5&lt;/em&gt; (8 weeks; _P_＜0.05). We found strong associations between cytokines, gut microbiota changes, and metabolic disturbances at different exposure times. These results suggest that time-specific changes in crosstalk among cytokines, the gut microbiota, and metabolites may be a potential mechanism for silica-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Faecal haemoglobin concentrations are associated with all-cause mortality and cause of death in colorectal cancer screening</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36691009/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36691009/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces all-cause and CRC-related mortality. New research demonstrates that the faecal haemoglobin concentration (f-Hb) may indicate the presence of other serious diseases not related to CRC. We investigated the association between f-Hb, measured by a faecal immunochemical test (FIT), and both all-cause mortality and cause of death in a population-wide cohort of screening participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Between 2014 and 2018, 1,262,165 participants submitted a FIT for the Danish CRC screening programme. We followed these participants, using the Danish CRC Screening Database and several other national registers on health and population, until December 31, 2018. We stratified participants by f-Hb and compared them using a Cox proportional hazards regression on all-cause mortality and cause of death reported as adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). We adjusted for several covariates, including comorbidity, socioeconomic factors, demography and prescription medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We observed 21,847 deaths in the study period. Our multivariate analyses indicated an association relationship between increasing f-Hb and the risk of dying in the study period. This risk increased steadily from aHR 1.38 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.44) in those with a f-Hb of 7.1-11.9 μg Hb/g faeces to 2.20 (95% CI: 2.10, 2.30) in those with a f-Hb ≥60.0 μg Hb/g faeces, when compared to those with a f-Hb ≤7.0 μg Hb/g faeces. The pattern remained when excluding CRC from the analysis. Similar patterns were observed between incrementally increasing f-Hb and the risk of dying from respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease and cancers other than CRC. Furthermore, we observed an increased risk of dying from CRC with increasing f-Hb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings support the hypothesis that f-Hb may indicate an elevated risk of having chronic conditions if causes for the bleeding have not been identified. The mechanisms still need to be established, but f-Hb may be a potential biomarker for several non-CRC diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAPK/JNK signaling is pivotal in carcinogenesis. However, ubiquitin-mediated homeostasis of JNK remains to be verified. Here, with results from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and luciferase reporter pathway identification, we show that USP14 orchestrates MAPK/JNK signaling and identify USP14 as a deubiquitinase that interacts and stabilizes JNK. USP14 is elevated in colorectal cancer patients and is positively associated with JNK protein and downstream gene expression. USP14 ablation reduces cancer cell proliferation in vitro and colorectal tumorigenesis in vivo by downregulating MAPK/JNK pathway activation. Moreover, USP14 expression is induced by TNF-α, forming a feedback loop with JNK and leading to tumor amplification. Our study suggests that elevated expression of USP14 promotes MAPK/JNK signaling by stabilizing JNK, which in turn augments colorectal carcinogenesis, indicating a potential therapeutic target for colorectal cancer patients with increased USP14 expression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular differences of angiogenic versus vessel co-opting colorectal cancer liver metastases at single-cell resolution</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36691028/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) are associated with a poor prognosis, reflected by a five-year survival rate of 14%. Anti-angiogenic therapy through anti-VEGF antibody administration is one of the limited therapies available. However, only a subgroup of metastases uses sprouting angiogenesis to secure their nutrients and oxygen supply, while others rely on vessel co-option (VCO). The distinct mode of vascularization is reflected by specific histopathological growth patterns (HGPs), which have proven prognostic and predictive significance. Nevertheless, their molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We evaluated CRCLM from 225 patients regarding their HGP and clinical data. Moreover, we performed spatial (21,804 spots) and single-cell (22,419 cells) RNA sequencing analyses to explore molecular differences in detail, further validated in vitro through immunohistochemical analysis and patient-derived organoid cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We detected specific metabolic alterations and a signature of WNT signalling activation in metastatic cancer cells related to the VCO phenotype. Importantly, in the corresponding healthy liver of CRCLM displaying sprouting angiogenesis, we identified a predominantly expressed capillary subtype of endothelial cells, which could be further explored as a possible predictor for HGP relying on sprouting angiogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These findings may prove to be novel therapeutic targets to the treatment of CRCLM, in special the ones relying on VCO.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comprehensive analysis of long noncoding RNAs and lncRNA-mRNA networks in snakehead (Channa argus) response to Nocardia seriolae infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36690266/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence has been demonstrated that lncRNAs were involved in a variety of immune responses in vertebrate. It has been demonstrated that immune-related lncRNAs play functions in immune regulation against pathogenic bacterial infections in teleost. Nocardia seriolae, as one of the Gram-positive bacteria, can cause chronic systemic granulomatous disease for snakehead (Channa argus). However, how lncRNAs function in the immune regulation process once snakehead was infected with N. seriolae infection has not been studied so far. Accordingly, transcription landscapes of lncRNAs and mRNAs in snakehead were investigated. A total of 1991 lncRNA were obtained. Co-localization and co-expression analyses predicted 57,584 co-expression and 16,047 co-location lncRNA-mRNA pairs. To further analyze the potential function of lncRNAs in these pairs, GO enrichment analysis and KEGG signal pathway were performed on the target mRNAs of the differently expressed lncRNAs, which suggested that lncRNAs may play essential roles in modulating mRNA expression levels and subsequently trigger downstream immune signaling pathways to regulate the immune response to pathogen infections in fish. In addition, 9 DEmRNA and 3 lncRNAs were randomly selected for qRT-PCR analyzed, which confirmed the accuracy of transcriptome data analysis. These results can provide novel knowledge about lncRNAs in immune responses process in snakehead, and could serve as important resources for further investigating the roles of lncRNAs during pathogen infections in teleost.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GATA6-AS1 regulates intestinal epithelial mitochondrial functions, and its reduced expression is linked to intestinal inflammation and less favorable disease course in ulcerative colitis (UC)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36655602/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Widespread dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) including a reduction in GATA6-AS1 was noted in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We previously reported a prominent inhibition of epithelial mitochondrial functions in UC. However, the connection between reduction of GATA6-AS1 expression and attenuated epithelial mitochondrial functions was not yet defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mucosal transcriptomics was used to conform GATA6-AS1 reduction in several treatment naïve independent human cohorts (n=673). RNA pull-down followed by mass-spectrometry was used to determine GATA6-AS1 interactome. Metabolomics and mitochondrial respiration following GATA6-AS1 silencing in Caco-2, were used to elaborate on GATA6-AS1 functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; GATA6-AS1 showed predominant expression in gut epithelia using single cell datasets. GATA6-AS1 levels were reduced in Crohn disease (CD) ileum and in ulcerative colitis (UC) rectum in independent cohorts. Reduced GATA6-AS1 lncRNA was further linked to more severe UC form, and to less favorable UC course. GATA6-AS1 interactome showed robust enrichment for mitochondrial proteins, and included TGM2, an autoantigen in celiac disease that is induced in UC, CD, and celiac, in contrast GATA6-AS1 reduction in these cohorts. GATA6-AS1 silencing resulted in induction of TGM2, and this was coupled with reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial respiration, as well as in reduction of metabolites linked with aerobic respiration relevant to mucosal inflammation. TGM2 knockdown in GATA6-AS1 deficient cells rescued mitochondrial respiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; GATA6-AS1 levels are reduced in UC, CD, and celiac, and in more severe UC forms. We highlight GATA6-AS1 as a target regulating epithelial mitochondrial functions, potentially through controlling TGM2 levels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiplexed 3D atlas of state transitions and immune interaction in colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiplexed analysis shows intermixed tumor morphologies and molecular gradients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various cancer characteristic cellular features are large, interconnected structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D TLS networks show intra-TLS patterning variation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PD1-PDL1 interactions are primarily between T and myeloid cells in this CRC cohort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced solid cancers are complex assemblies of tumor, immune, and stromal cells characterized by high intratumoral variation. We use highly multiplexed tissue imaging, 3D reconstruction, spatial statistics, and machine learning to identify cell types and states underlying morphological features of known diagnostic and prognostic significance in colorectal cancer. Quantitation of these features in high-plex marker space reveals recurrent transitions from one tumor morphology to the next, some of which are coincident with long-range gradients in the expression of oncogenes and epigenetic regulators. At the tumor invasive margin, where tumor, normal, and immune cells compete, T cell suppression involves multiple cell types and 3D imaging shows that seemingly localized 2D features such as tertiary lymphoid structures are commonly interconnected and have graded molecular properties. Thus, while cancer genetics emphasizes the importance of discrete changes in tumor state, whole-specimen imaging reveals large-scale morphological and molecular gradients analogous to those in developing tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High-resolution analysis of mononuclear phagocytes reveals GPNMB as a prognostic marker in human colorectal liver metastasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36652202/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) present with heterogenous clinical outcomes and improved classification is needed to ameliorate the therapeutic output. Macrophages (MΦ) hold promise as prognostic classifiers and therapeutic targets. Here, stemming from a single-cell analysis of mononuclear phagocytes infiltrating human CLM, we identified two M markers associated with distinct populations with opposite clinical relevance. The invasive margin of CLM was enriched in pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived MΦ (MoMΦ) expressing the monocytic marker SERPINB2, and a more differentiated population, TAMs, expressing GPNMB. SERPINB2+ MoMΦ had an early inflammatory profile, whereas GPNMB+ TAMs were enriched in pathways of matrix degradation, angiogenesis and lipid metabolism and were found closer to the tumor margin, as confirmed by spatial transcriptomics on CLM specimens. In a cohort of patients, a high infiltration of SERPINB2+ cells independently associated with longer disease-free survival (DFS) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.033), whereas a high density of GPNMB+ cells correlated with shorter DFS (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.012) and overall survival (OS) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.002). Cell-cell interaction analysis defined opposing roles for MoMΦ and TAMs, suggesting that SERPINB2+ and GPNMB+ cells are discrete populations of MΦ and may be exploited for further translation to an immune-based stratification tool. This study provides evidence of how multi-omics approaches can identify non-redundant, clinically relevant markers for further translation to immune-based patient stratification tools and therapeutic targets. GPNMB has been shown to set macrophages in an immunosuppressive mode. Our high dimensional analyses provide further evidence that GPNMB is a negative prognostic indicator and a potential player in the pro-tumor function of macrophage populations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 dephosphorylates IκBα and suppresses colorectal tumorigenesis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36646759/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence demonstrates that some metabolic enzymes that phosphorylate soluble metabolites can also phosphorylate a variety of protein substrates as protein kinases to regulate cell cycle, apoptosis and many other fundamental cellular processes. However, whether a metabolic enzyme dephosphorylates protein as a protein phosphatase remains unknown. Here we reveal the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose 1,6-biphosphatase 1 (FBP1) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP) to fructose 6-phosphate (F-6-P) as a protein phosphatase by performing a high-throughput screening of metabolic phosphatases with molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Moreover, we identify IκBα as the substrate of FBP1-mediated dephosphorylation by performing phosphoproteomic analysis. Mechanistically, FBP1 directly interacts with and dephosphorylates the serine (S) 32/36 of IκBα upon TNFα stimulation, thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation. MD simulations indicate that the catalytic mechanism of FBP1-mediated IκBα dephosphorylation is similar to F-1,6-BP dephosphorylation, except for higher energetic barriers for IκBα dephosphorylation. Functionally, FBP1-dependent NF-κB inactivation suppresses colorectal tumorigenesis by sensitizing tumor cells to inflammatory stresses and preventing the mobilization of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Our finding reveals a previously unrecognized role of FBP1 as a protein phosphatase and establishes the critical role of FBP1-mediated IκBα dephosphorylation in colorectal tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular residual disease and efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36646802/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite standard-of-care treatment, more than 30% of patients with resectable colorectal cancer (CRC) relapse. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis may enable postsurgical risk stratification and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) treatment decision-making. We report results from GALAXY, which is an observational arm of the ongoing CIRCULATE-Japan study (UMIN000039205) that analyzed presurgical and postsurgical ctDNA in patients with stage II-IV resectable CRC (n = 1,039). In this cohort, with a median follow-up of 16.74 months (range 0.49-24.83 months), postsurgical ctDNA positivity (at 4 weeks after surgery) was associated with higher recurrence risk (hazard ratio (HR) 10.0, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and was the most significant prognostic factor associated with recurrence risk in patients with stage II or III CRC (HR 10.82, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Furthermore, postsurgical ctDNA positivity identified patients with stage II or III CRC who derived benefit from ACT (HR 6.59, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). The results of our study, a large and comprehensive prospective analysis of ctDNA in resectable CRC, support the use of ctDNA testing to identify patients who are at increased risk of recurrence and are likely to benefit from ACT.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting KRAS-mutant stomach/colorectal tumors by disrupting the ERK2-p53 complex</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36641751/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;p53 associates with phosphorylated ERK2 through a hydrophobic interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutant KRAS enables ERK2 to interact with p53 based on conformation change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trametinib disrupts the ERK2-p53 complex by blocking ERK2 phosphorylation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trametinib promotes PUMA transcription by recruiting p300/CBP to p53 protein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KRAS is widely mutated in human cancers, resulting in unchecked tumor proliferation and metastasis, which makes identifying KRAS-targeting therapies a priority. Herein, we observe that mutant KRAS specifically promotes the formation of the ERK2-p53 complex in stomach/colorectal tumor cells. Disruption of this complex by applying MEK1/2 and ERK2 inhibitors elicits strong apoptotic responses in a p53-dependent manner, validated by genome-wide knockout screening. Mechanistically, p53 physically associates with phosphorylated ERK2 through a hydrophobic interaction in the presence of mutant KRAS, which suppresses p53 activation by preventing the recruitment of p300/CBP; trametinib disrupts the ERK2-p53 complex by reducing ERK2 phosphorylation, allowing the acetylation of p53 protein by recruiting p300/CBP; acetylated p53 activates PUMA transcription and thereby kills KRAS-mutant tumors. Our study shows an important role for the ERK2-p53 complex and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for treating KRAS-mutant cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of mechanism of cancer-cell-specific reactivation of hTERT offers therapeutic opportunities for blocking telomerase specifically in human colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35697349/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcriptional reactivation of hTERT is the limiting step in tumorigenesis. While mutations in hTERT promoter present in 19% of cancers are recognized as key drivers of hTERT reactivation, mechanisms by which wildtype hTERT (WT-hTERT) promoter is reactivated, in majority of human cancers, remain unknown. Using primary colorectal cancers (CRC) we identified Tert INTeracting region 2 (T-INT2), the critical chromatin region essential for reactivating WT-hTERT promoter in CRCs. Elevated β-catenin and JunD level in CRC facilitates chromatin interaction between hTERT promoter and T-INT2 that is necessary to turn on hTERTexpression. Pharmacological screens uncovered salinomycin, which inhibits JunD mediated hTERT-T-INT2 interaction that is required for the formation of a stable transcription complex on the hTERT promoter. Our results showed for the first time how known CRC alterations, such as APC, lead to WT-hTERT promoter reactivation during stepwise-tumorigenesis and provide a new perspective for developing cancer-specific drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sesamolin Attenuates Kidney Injury, Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction, and Gut Microbiota Imbalance in High-Fat and High-Fructose Diet-Fed Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36630317/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the effects of sesamolin on kidney injury, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and gut microbiota imbalance in high-fat and high-fructose (HF-HF) diet-fed mice and explored the underlying correlations among them. The results indicated that sesamolin suppressed metabolic disorders and increased renal function parameters. Histological evaluation showed that sesamolin mitigated renal epithelial cell degeneration and brush border damage. Meanwhile, sesamolin inhibited the endotoxin-mediated induction of the Toll-like receptor 4-related IKKα/NF-κB p65 pathway activation. Additionally, sesamolin mitigated intestinal barrier dysfunction and improved the composition of gut microbiota. The correlation results further indicated that changes in the dominant phyla, including &lt;em&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deferribacterota&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Desulfobacterota&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroidota&lt;/em&gt;, were more highly correlated with a reduction in endotoxemia and metabolic disorders, as well as decreases in intestinal proinflammatory response and related renal risk biomarkers. The results of this study suggest that sesamolin attenuates kidney injuries, which might be associated with its effects on the reduction of endotoxemia and related metabolic disorders through the restoration of the intestinal barrier and the modulation of gut microbiota. Thus, sesamolin may be a potential dietary supplement for protection against obesity-associated kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updated epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36631716/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/36631716/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, gastrointestinal cancers represent more than one-fourth of all cancer incidence and one-third of cancer-related mortality. Although there has been much progress in screening colorectal cancer, the prognosis of other gastrointestinal cancers tends to be poor. The highest burden of gastrointestinal cancers, including stomach, liver, oesophageal and gallbladder cancers, was observed in regions in East Asia. The increasing burden of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asian regions is related to population growth, ageing and the westernization of lifestyle habits in this region. Furthermore, the rising incidence of young-onset colorectal cancer is an emerging trend in East Asia. This Review provides a comprehensive and updated summary of the epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia, with emphasis on comparing their epidemiology in East Asia with that in Western regions, and highlights the major risk factors and implications for prevention. Overall, to optimally reduce the disease burden incurred by gastrointestinal cancers in East Asian regions, a concerted effort will be needed to modify unhealthy lifestyles, promote vaccination against the hepatitis virus, control Helicobacter pylori, liver fluke and hepatitis virus infections, increase the uptake rate of colorectal cancer screening, enhance detection of early cancers and their precursors, and improve cancer survivorship through an organized rehabilitation programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a substantial burden of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia, with the highest incidence observed in colorectal and stomach cancer and the highest mortality in liver and stomach cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared with Western regions, East Asia has a higher burden of stomach, liver, oesophageal and gallbladder cancer, but the burden of colorectal and pancreatic cancer is increasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an increasing trend in young-onset colorectal, pancreatic and gallbladder cancer in East Asia attributed to the bigger increase in risk factors among the younger population.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common modifiable risk factors for gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia include smoking, alcohol intake, diet, sedentary lifestyle, obesity and metabolic diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;East Asian regions have a higher prevalence of &lt;em&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt;, liver fluke, and hepatitis B and C virus infections, hot beverage consumption and biliary cyst development, which might have increased the risk of gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key preventive strategies for gastrointestinal cancers in the East Asian population include lifestyle modifications, hepatitis vaccination, &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; infection control, cancer screening, early diagnosis and improving cancer survivorship.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>GATA4 controls regionalization of tissue immunity and commensal-driven immunopathology</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36630917/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GATA4 prevents small intestinal inflammation by restricting bacterial colonization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GATA4 regulates bacterial colonization in part by regulating IgA and retinol metabolism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GATA4 deficiency, SFB, and &lt;em&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/em&gt; synergize to drive immunopathology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Th17 immunity is found in celiac patients with GATA4 deficiency and &lt;em&gt;Actinobacillus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is growing recognition that regionalization of bacterial colonization and immunity along the intestinal tract has an important role in health and disease. Yet, the mechanisms underlying intestinal regionalization and its dysregulation in disease are not well understood. This study found that regional epithelial expression of the transcription factor GATA4 controls bacterial colonization and inflammatory tissue immunity in the proximal small intestine by regulating retinol metabolism and luminal IgA. Furthermore, in mice without jejunal GATA4 expression, the commensal segmented filamentous bacteria promoted pathogenic inflammatory immune responses that disrupted barrier function and increased mortality upon &lt;em&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/em&gt; infection. In celiac disease patients, low GATA4 expression was associated with metabolic alterations, mucosal Actinobacillus, and increased IL-17 immunity. Taken together, these results reveal broad impacts of GATA4-regulated intestinal regionalization on bacterial colonization and tissue immunity, highlighting an elaborate interdependence of intestinal metabolism, immunity, and microbiota in homeostasis and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition in which women without diabetes are diagnosed with glucose intolerance during pregnancy, typically in the second or third trimester. Early diagnosis, along with a better understanding of its pathophysiology during the first trimester of pregnancy, may be effective in reducing incidence and associated short-term and long-term morbidities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design:&lt;/em&gt; We comprehensively profiled the gut microbiome, metabolome, inflammatory cytokines, nutrition and clinical records of 394 women during the first trimester of pregnancy, before GDM diagnosis. We then built a model that can predict GDM onset weeks before it is typically diagnosed. Further, we demonstrated the role of the microbiome in disease using faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) of first trimester samples from pregnant women across three unique cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in women who later developed GDM, decreased faecal short-chain fatty acids and altered microbiome. We next confirmed that differences in GDM-associated microbial composition during the first trimester drove inflammation and insulin resistance more than 10 weeks prior to GDM diagnosis using FMT experiments. Following these observations, we used a machine learning approach to predict GDM based on first trimester clinical, microbial and inflammatory markers with high accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; GDM onset can be identified in the first trimester of pregnancy, earlier than currently accepted. Furthermore, the gut microbiome appears to play a role in inflammation-induced GDM pathogenesis, with interleukin-6 as a potential contributor to pathogenesis. Potential GDM markers, including microbiota, can serve as targets for early diagnostics and therapeutic intervention leading to prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SHP2 deneddylation mediates tumor immunosuppression in colon cancer via the CD47/SIRPα axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36626230/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIPRα on macrophages binds with CD47 to resist pro-engulfment signals, but how the downstream signal of SIPRα controls tumor-infiltrating macrophages (TIMs) is still poorly clarified. Here we reported that the CD47/SIRPα axis requires the deneddylation of tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. Mechanistically, SHP2 is constitutively neddylated on K358 and K364 sites, thus its auto-inhibited conformation is maintained. In response to CD47-liganded SIRPα, SHP2 is deneddylated by SENP8, which leads to the dephosphorylation of relevant substrates at the phagocytic cup and subsequent inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis. Furthermore, neddylation inactivated myeloid-SHP2 and greatly boosted the efficacy of colorectal cancer (CRC) immunotherapy. Importantly, we observed that the supplementation with SHP2 allosteric inhibitors sensitized the immune treatment-resistant CRC to immunotherapy. Our results emphasized that the CRC subtype which is unresponsive to immunotherapy relies on SIRPαhiSHP2hiNEDD8lo TIMs, and highlighted the need to further combine the strategy of SHP2 targeting in colorectal cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>F4/80&#43;Ly6Chigh macrophages lead to cell plasticity and cancer initiation in colitis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death with a major risk factor being chronic inflammation. Despite the link between colitis and cancer, the mechanism by which inflammation leads to CRC is not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate whether different forms of inflammation pose the same risk of cancer, we compared several murine models of colitis (dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), 4-ethoxylmethylene-2-phenyloxazol-5-one (oxazolone), &lt;em&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/em&gt;, and doxorubicin) with respect to their ability to lead to colonic tumorigenesis. We attempted to correlate the severity of colitis and inflammatory profile with the risk of tumorigenesis in both azoxymethane (AOM)-dependent and &lt;em&gt;Dclk1/APC&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; murine models of colitis-associated cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; DSS colitis reproducibly led to colonic tumors in both mouse models of colitis-associated cancer. In contrast, all the other forms of colitis did not lead to cancer. When compared to the colitis not associated with tumorigenesis, DSS-colitis was characterized by significantly increased CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages and CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6G&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neutrophils. Interestingly, depletion of the CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages inhibited tumorigenesis, whereas depletion of CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6G&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neutrophils had no effect on tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the macrophage-derived cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were significantly increased in DSS-colitis and promoted stemness of Dclk1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tuft cells that serve as the cellular origin of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We have identified CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages as key mediators of cancer initiation in colitis-associated cancer. Development of new therapies that target these cells may provide an effective preventative strategy for colitis-associated cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multistain deep learning for prediction of prognosis and therapy response in colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it has long been known that the immune cell composition has a strong prognostic and predictive value in colorectal cancer (CRC), scoring systems such as the immunoscore (IS) or quantification of intraepithelial lymphocytes are only slowly being adopted into clinical routine use and have their limitations. To address this we established and evaluated a multistain deep learning model (MSDLM) utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to determine the AImmunoscore (AIS) in more than 1,000 patients with CRC. Our model had high prognostic capabilities and outperformed other clinical, molecular and immune cell-based parameters. It could also be used to predict the response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with rectal cancer. Using an explainable AI approach, we confirmed that the MSDLM&amp;rsquo;s decisions were based on established cellular patterns of anti-tumor immunity. Hence, the AIS could provide clinicians with a valuable decision-making tool based on the tumor immune microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Promote Metastases of Colorectal Cancers through Activation of ERK Signaling by Releasing Neutrophil Elastase</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36674635/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play important roles in host immunity, as there is increasing evidence of their contribution to the progression of several types of cancers even though their role in colorectal cancers (CRCs) remains unclear. To investigate the clinical relevance of NETs in CRCs, we examined the expression of citrullinated histone H3 using immunohistochemistry and preoperative serum myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes in CRC patients using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High expression of intratumoral or systemic NETs was found to correlate with poor relapse-free survival (RFS), for which it is an independent prognostic factor. In vitro investigations of CRC cells (HCT116, HT29) revealed that NETs did not affect their proliferation but did promote the migration of CRC cells mediated by neutrophil elastase (NE) released during NETosis to increase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. In vivo experiments using nude mice (KSN/slc) revealed that NE inhibition suppressed liver metastases in CRC cells, although it did not affect the growth of subcutaneously implanted tumors. Taken together, these results suggest that NET formation correlates with poor prognoses of patients with CRC and that the inhibition of NE could be a potential therapy for CRC metastases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A DLG1-ARHGAP31-CDC42 axis is essential for the intestinal stem cell response to fluctuating niche Wnt signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36640764/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polarity of the mammalian intestinal epithelium is independent of &lt;em&gt;Dlg1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of &lt;em&gt;Dlg1&lt;/em&gt; in ISCs results in cell death under high Wnt conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISCs lacking &lt;em&gt;Dlg1&lt;/em&gt; have impaired cell division and migration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canonical WNT ligands activate non-canonical Wnt signaling via DLG1-ARHGAP31-CDC42&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central factor in the maintenance of tissue integrity is the response of stem cells to variations in the levels of niche signals. In the gut, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) depend on Wnt ligands for self-renewal and proliferation. Transient increases in Wnt signaling promote regeneration after injury or in inflammatory bowel diseases, whereas constitutive activation of this pathway leads to colorectal cancer. Here, we report that Discs large 1 (&lt;em&gt;Dlg1&lt;/em&gt;), although dispensable for polarity and cellular turnover during intestinal homeostasis, is required for ISC survival in the context of increased Wnt signaling. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and genetic mouse models demonstrated that DLG1 regulates the cellular response to increased canonical Wnt ligands. This occurs via the transcriptional regulation of &lt;em&gt;Arhgap31&lt;/em&gt;, a GTPase-activating protein that deactivates CDC42, an effector of the non-canonical Wnt pathway. These findings reveal a DLG1-ARHGAP31-CDC42 axis that is essential for the ISC response to increased niche Wnt signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metagenome-based resources have revealed the diversity and function of the human gut microbiome, but further understanding is limited by insufficient genome quality and a lack of samples from typically understudied populations. Here we used hybrid long-read PromethION and short-read HiSeq sequencing to characterize the faecal microbiota of 60 Inner Mongolian individuals (n = 180 samples over three time points) who were part of a probiotic yogurt intervention trial. We present the Inner Mongolian Gut Genome catalogue, comprising 802 closed and 5,927 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes. This approach achieved high genome continuity and substantially increased the resolution of genomic elements, including ribosomal RNA operons, metabolic gene clusters, prophages and insertion sequences. Particularly, we report the ribosomal RNA operon copy numbers for uncultured species, over 12,000 previously undescribed gut prophages and the distribution of insertion sequence elements across gut bacteria. Overall, these data provide a high-quality, large-scale resource for studying the human gut microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Numerous genes are implicated in the etiology of IBD, but the diagnosis of IBD is challenging. Here, XGBoost, a machine learning prediction model, has been used to distinguish IBD from healthy cases following elaborative feature selection. Using combined unsupervised clustering analysis and the XGBoost feature selection method, we successfully identified a 32-gene signature that can predict IBD occurrence in new cohorts with 0.8651 accuracy. The signature shows enrichment in neutrophil extracellular trap formation and cytokine signaling in the immune system. The probability threshold of the XGBoost-based classification model can be adjusted to fit personalized lifestyle and health status. Therefore, this study reveals potential IBD-related biomarkers that facilitate an effective personalized diagnosis of IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of faecal extracellular vesicles as novel biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36604402/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies that is usually detected late in the clinic. The currently available diagnostic tools for CRC are either invasive or insensitive to early lesions due to the dearth of reliable biomarkers. In this study, we discovered that the extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the faeces of CRC patients can act as a potent biomarker for the non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of CRC. This finding is based on the identification of two transmembrane proteins-CD147 and A33-on faeces-derived EVs (fEVs) that are intrinsically associated with CRC. The detection results show that the levels of CD147 and A33 on fEVs were upregulated in the CRC patients (n = 48), dramatically distinguishing them from the healthy donors (n = 16). The CD147/A33-enriched EVs offer a clinical sensitivity of 89%, much higher than that (40%) of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a clinically-established serum biomarker for CRC diagnosis. In addition, the analysis of longitudinal faeces samples (n = 29) demonstrated that the CD147/A33-enriched fEVs can be utilized to track the prognosis of CRC. Due to the high compliance of faeces-based detection, the CD147/A33-enriched fEVs could serve as new-generation CRC biomarkers for large-scale, non-invasive CRC screening as well as real-time monitoring of patient outcomes during clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While several artificial nanodrugs have been approved for clinical treatment of breast tumor, their long-term applications are restricted by unsatisfactory therapeutic outcomes, side reactions and high costs. Conversely, edible plant-derived natural nanotherapeutics (NTs) are source-widespread and cost-effective, which have been shown remarkably effective in disease treatment. Herein, we extracted and purified exosome-like NTs from tea leaves (TLNTs), which had an average diameter of 166.9 nm and a negative-charged surface of - 28.8 mV. These TLNTs contained an adequate slew of functional components such as lipids, proteins and pharmacologically active molecules. In vitro studies indicated that TLNTs were effectively internalized by breast tumor cells (4T1 cells) and caused a 2.5-fold increase in the amount of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) after incubation for 8 h. The high levels of ROS triggered mitochondrial damages and arrested cell cycles, resulting in the apoptosis of tumor cells. The mouse experiments revealed that TLNTs achieved good therapeutic effects against breast tumors regardless of intravenous injection and oral administration through direct pro-apoptosis and microbiota modulation. Strikingly, the intravenous injection of TLNTs, not oral administration, yielded obvious hepatorenal toxicity and immune activation. These findings collectively demonstrate that TLNTs can be developed as a promising oral therapeutic platform for the treatment of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of gut homeostasis is associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder affecting approximately 11.2% of the global population. The poorly understood pathogenesis of IBS has impeded its treatment. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing 27 (TRIM27) is weakly expressed in IBS but highly expressed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a frequent chronic organic gastrointestinal disorder. Accordingly, knockout of &lt;em&gt;Trim27&lt;/em&gt; in mice causes spontaneously occurring IBS-like symptoms, including increased visceral hyperalgesia and abnormal stool features, as observed in IBS patients. Mechanistically, TRIM27 stabilizes β-catenin and thus activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote intestinal stem cell (ISC) self-renewal. Consistent with these findings, &lt;em&gt;Trim27&lt;/em&gt; deficiency disrupts organoid formation, which is rescued by reintroducing TRIM27 or β-catenin. Furthermore, Wnt/β-catenin signaling activator treatment ameliorates IBS symptoms by promoting ISC self-renewal. Taken together, these data indicate that TRIM27 is critical for maintaining gut homeostasis, suggesting that targeting the TRIM27/Wnt/β-catenin axis could be a potential treatment strategy for IBS. Our study also indicates that TRIM27 might serve as a potential biomarker for differentiating IBS from IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL-99 ameliorates colitis-related lung injury in mice by modulating short-chain fatty acid production and inflammatory monocytes/macrophages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary inflammation as one of the extraintestinal manifestations of ulcerative colitis (UC) has attracted extensive attention, and its pathogenesis is closely related to gut dysbiosis. &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis&lt;/em&gt; subsp. lactis BL-99 (BL-99) can alleviate osteoporosis caused by UC, but less research has been done on other extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) caused by UC. This study aimed to explore the role and potential mechanisms of BL-99 on DSS-induced pulmonary complications in colitis mice. The results showed that BL-99 decreased weight loss, disease activity index score, colonic pathology score, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in colitis mice. BL-99 also alleviated DSS-induced lung pathological damage by suppressing the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory monocytes, and macrophages. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed lower abundances of several potentially pathogenic bacteria (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Burkholderia, Shigella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/em&gt;) and enrichment in specific beneficial bacteria (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Adlercreutzia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis&lt;/em&gt;) in colitis mice with BL-99 treatment. Targeted metabolomics suggested that BL-99 intervention promoted the production of intestinal acetate and butyrate. Finally, we observed that the pulmonary expression of primary acetate and butyrate receptors, including FFAR2, FFAR3, and, GPR109a, was up-regulated in BL-99-treated mice, which negatively correlated with inflammatory monocytes and macrophages. Altogether, these results suggest that BL-99 might be utilized as a probiotic intervention to prevent the incidence of colitis-related lung injury owing to its ability to shape the intestinal microbiota and suppress inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiome dysregulation drives bone damage in broiler tibial dyschondroplasia by disrupting glucose homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36596826/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) with multiple incentives is a metabolic skeletal disease that occurs in fast-growing broilers. Perturbations in the gut microbiota (GM) have been shown to affect bone homoeostasis, but the mechanisms by which GM modulates bone metabolism in TD broilers remain unknown. Here, using a broiler model of TD, we noted elevated blood glucose (GLU) levels in TD broilers, accompanied by alterations in the pancreatic structure and secretory function and damaged intestinal barrier function. Importantly, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of gut microbes from normal donors rehabilitated the GM and decreased the elevated GLU levels in TD broilers. A high GLU level is a predisposing factor to bone disease, suggesting that GM dysbiosis-mediated hyperglycaemia might be involved in bone regulation. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and short-chain fatty acid analysis revealed that the significantly increased level of the metabolite butyric acid derived from the genera &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Coprococcus&lt;/em&gt; regulated GLU levels in TD broilers by binding to GPR109A in the pancreas. Tibial studies showed reduced expression of vascular regulatory factors (including PI3K, AKT and VEFGA) based on transcriptomics analysis and reduced vascular distribution, contributing to nonvascularization of cartilage in the proximal tibial growth plate of TD broilers with elevated GLU levels. Additionally, treatment with the total flavonoids from Rhizoma drynariae further validated the improvement in bone homoeostasis in TD broilers by regulating GLU levels through the regulation of GM to subsequently improve intestinal and pancreatic function. These findings clarify the critical role of GM-mediated changes in GLU levels via the gut–pancreas axis in bone homoeostasis in TD chickens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colonic macrophages are critical for maintenance of CD4+ T cell homeostasis in intestinal lamina propria. However, the mechanisms by which this process is regulated at the transcriptional level remain unknown. Here, we found that the transcriptional corepressors TLE3 and TLE4, but not TLE1 or TLE2, in colonic macrophages controlled homeostasis of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell pool in colonic lamina propria. Mice lacking TLE3 or TLE4 in myeloid cells exhibited markedly increased numbers of T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells under homeostatic conditions, rendering mice more resistant to experimental colitis. Mechanistically, TLE3 and TLE4 negatively regulated Mmp9 transcription in colonic macrophages. &lt;em&gt;Tle3&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Tle4&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in colonic macrophages resulted in upregulated MMP9 production and thus enhanced latent TGF-β activation, which subsequently led to T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cell expansion. These results advanced our knowledge regarding the intricate crosstalk between the intestinal innate and adaptive immune compartments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i-ROBOT converts IBD information into trackable and heritable DNA alterations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i-ROBOT contains a self-tunable, thiosulfate-regulated drug release system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i-ROBOT has a replaceable biomarker-sensing element, creating a broad platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid advances in synthetic biology have fueled interest in engineered microorganisms that can diagnose and treat disease. However, designing bacteria that detect dynamic disease-associated biomarkers that then drive treatment remains difficult. Here, we have developed an engineered probiotic that noninvasively monitors and records inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) occurrence and progression in real time and can release treatments via a self-tunable mechanism in response to these biomarkers. These intelligent responsive bacteria for diagnosis and therapy (i-ROBOT) consists of E. coli Nissle 1917 that responds to levels of the inflammatory marker thiosulfate by activating a base-editing system to generate a heritable genomic DNA sequence as well as producing a colorimetric signal. Fluctuations in thiosulfate also drive the tunable release of the immunomodulator AvCystatin. Orally administering i-ROBOT to mice with colitis generated molecular recording signals in processed fecal and colon samples and effectively ameliorated disease. i-ROBOT provides a promising paradigm for gastrointestinal and other metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UBE2J1 inhibits colorectal cancer progression by promoting ubiquitination and degradation of RPS3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J1 (UBE2J1) has been proven to participate in the ubiquitination of multiple substrate proteins. However, the underlying mechanisms of UBE2J1 as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme participating in cancer development and progression remain largely unknown. Here, we identified that UBE2J1 is downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and cell lines which are mediated by DNA hypermethylation of its promoter, and decreased UBE2J1 is associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, UBE2J1 serving as a suppressor gene inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells. Mechanistically, UBE2J1-TRIM25, forming an E2-E3 complex, physically interacts with and targets RPS3 for ubiquitination and degradation at the K214 residue. The downregulated RPS3 caused by UBE2J1 overexpression restrains NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and therefore inactivates the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our study revealed a novel role of UBE2J1-mediated RPS3 poly-ubiquitination and degradation in disrupting the NF-κB signaling pathway, which may serve as a novel and promising biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The sodium channel subunit SCNN1B suppresses colorectal cancer via suppression of active c-Raf and MAPK signaling cascade</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36564468/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rising worldwide. Here, we identified SCNN1B as an outlier down-regulated in CRC and it functions as a tumor suppressor. SCNN1B mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated in primary CRC and CRC cells. In a tissue microarray cohort (N = 153), SCNN1B protein was an independent prognostic factor for favorable outcomes in CRC. Ectopic expression of SCNN1B in CRC cell lines suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, and suppressed cell migration in vitro. Xenograft models validated tumor suppressive function of SCNN1B in vivo. Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that SCNN1B correlates with KRAS signaling. Consistently, MAPK qPCR and kinase arrays revealed that SCNN1B suppressed MAPK signaling. In particular, SCNN1B overexpression suppressed p-MEK/p-ERK expression and SRE-mediated transcription activities, confirming blockade of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. Mechanistically, SCNN1B did not affect KRAS activation, instead impairing activation of c-Raf by inducing its inhibitory phosphorylation and targeting active c-Raf for degradation. The ectopic expression of c-Raf fully rescued cell proliferation and colony formation in SCNN1B-overexpressing CRC cells, confirming c-Raf as the principal molecular target of SCNN1B. In summary, we identified SCNN1B as a tumor suppressor by functioning as a c-Raf antagonist, which in turn suppressed oncogenic MEK-ERK signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiota modulates lung fibrosis severity following acute lung injury in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent studies demonstrate the significance of gut microbiota on the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases; yet little is known regarding the role of the gut microbiota in lung fibrosis progression. Here we show, using the bleomycin murine model to quantify lung fibrosis in C57BL/6 J mice housed in germ-free, animal biosafety level 1 (ABSL-1), or animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL-2) environments, that germ-free mice are protected from lung fibrosis, while ABSL-1 and ABSL-2 mice develop mild and severe lung fibrosis, respectively. Metagenomic analysis reveals no notable distinctions between ABSL-1 and ABSL-2 lung microbiota, whereas greater microbial diversity, with increased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacilli, is present in ABSL-1 compared to ABSL-2 gut microbiota. Flow cytometric analysis reveals enhanced IL-6/STAT3/IL-17A signaling in pulmonary CD4 + T cells of ABSL-2 mice. Fecal transplantation of ABSL-2 stool into germ-free mice recapitulated more severe fibrosis than transplantation of ABSL-1 stool. Lactobacilli supernatant reduces collagen 1 A production in IL-17A- and TGFβ1-stimulated human lung fibroblasts. These findings support a functional role of the gut microbiota in augmenting lung fibrosis severity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chronic exposure to synthetic food colorant Allura Red AC promotes susceptibility to experimental colitis via intestinal serotonin in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36539404/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemicals in food are widely used leading to significant human exposure. Allura Red AC (AR) is a highly common synthetic colorant; however, little is known about its impact on colitis. Here, we show chronic exposure of AR at a dose found in commonly consumed dietary products exacerbates experimental models of colitis in mice. While intermittent exposure is more akin to a typical human exposure, intermittent exposure to AR in mice for 12 weeks, does not influence susceptibility to colitis. However, exposure to AR during early life primes mice to heightened susceptibility to colitis. In addition, chronic exposure to AR induces mild colitis, which is associated with elevated colonic serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) levels and impairment of the epithelial barrier function via myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Importantly, chronic exposure to AR does not influence colitis susceptibility in mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), the rate limiting enzyme for 5-HT biosynthesis. Cecal transfer of the perturbed gut microbiota by AR exposure worsens colitis severity in the recipient germ-free (GF) mice. Furthermore, chronic AR exposure elevates colonic 5-HT levels in naïve GF mice. Though it remains unknown whether AR has similar effects in humans, our study reveals that chronic long-term exposure to a common synthetic colorant promotes experimental colitis via colonic 5-HT in gut microbiota-dependent and -independent pathway in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. We conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of 100,204 CRC cases and 154,587 controls of European and east Asian ancestry, identifying 205 independent risk associations, of which 50 were unreported. We performed integrative genomic, transcriptomic and methylomic analyses across large bowel mucosa and other tissues. Transcriptome- and methylome-wide association studies revealed an additional 53 risk associations. We identified 155 high-confidence effector genes functionally linked to CRC risk, many of which had no previously established role in CRC. These have multiple different functions and specifically indicate that variation in normal colorectal homeostasis, proliferation, cell adhesion, migration, immunity and microbial interactions determines CRC risk. Crosstissue analyses indicated that over a third of effector genes most probably act outside the colonic mucosa. Our findings provide insights into colorectal oncogenesis and highlight potential targets across tissues for new CRC treatment and chemoprevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Study on the protective effect of berberine treatment on sepsis based on gut microbiota and metabolomic analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis, an infection with multiorgan dysfunction, is a serious burden on human health. Berberine (BBR), a bioactive component, has a protective effect on sepsis and the effect may be related to gut microbiota. However, studies on the role of BBR with gut microbiota in sepsis are lacking. Therefore, this study investigated the ameliorative effects and the underlying mechanisms of BBR on cecal ligature and puncture (CLP) rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; This study has observed the effect of BBR on pathological injury, Inflammation, intestinal barrier function, gut microbiota, and metabolite change in CLP rats by Hematoxylin-eosin staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, flow cytometry, 16S rDNA, and metabolomics analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The inhibition effects of BBR treatment on the histological damage of the lung, kidney, and ileum, the interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-17A, and monocyte chemokine-1 levels in serum in CLP rats were proved. Also, the BBR inhibited the diamine-oxidase and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 40 levels, suggesting it can improve intestinal barrier function disorders. The cluster of differentiation (CD) 4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and CD25&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3) &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T lymphocytes in splenocytes were up-regulated by BBR, while the IL-17A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell level was decreased. The abundance of gut microbiota in CLP rats was significantly different from that of the sham and BBR treatment rats. The significantly changed metabolites in the serum mainly included carbohydrates, phenols, benzoic acids, alcohols, vitamins et al. Additionally, this study predicted that the biological mechanism of BBR to ameliorate sepsis involves glycolysis-, nucleotide-, and amino acid-related metabolic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion: This study proved the strong correlation between the improvement effect of BBR on sepsis and gut microbiota and analyzed by metabolomics that gut microbiota may improve CLP rats through metabolites, providing a scientific basis for BBR to improve sepsis and a new direction for the study of the biological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microenvironmental ammonia enhances T cell exhaustion in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36528023/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autochthonous metastatic mouse model of colon cancer is refractory to immunotherapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ammonia accumulates in tumors and reduces T cell function &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ammonia decreases T cell transsulfuration leading to altered redox status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearance of ammonia reactivates T cells and decreases colorectal cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective therapies are lacking for patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). The CRC tumor microenvironment has elevated metabolic waste products due to altered metabolism and proximity to the microbiota. The role of metabolite waste in tumor development, progression, and treatment resistance is unclear. We generated an autochthonous metastatic mouse model of CRC and used unbiased multi-omic analyses to reveal a robust accumulation of tumoral ammonia. The high ammonia levels induce T cell metabolic reprogramming, increase exhaustion, and decrease proliferation. CRC patients have increased serum ammonia, and the ammonia-related gene signature correlates with altered T cell response, adverse patient outcomes, and lack of response to immune checkpoint blockade. We demonstrate that enhancing ammonia clearance reactivates T cells, decreases tumor growth, and extends survival. Moreover, decreasing tumor-associated ammonia enhances anti-PD-L1 efficacy. These findings indicate that enhancing ammonia detoxification can reactivate T cells, highlighting a new approach to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A microbiome-dependent gut–brain pathway regulates motivation for exercise</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise exerts a wide range of beneficial effects for healthy physiology. However, the mechanisms regulating an individual’s motivation to engage in physical activity remain incompletely understood. An important factor stimulating the engagement in both competitive and recreational exercise is the motivating pleasure derived from prolonged physical activity, which is triggered by exercise-induced neurochemical changes in the brain. Here, we report on the discovery of a gut–brain connection in mice that enhances exercise performance by augmenting dopamine signalling during physical activity. We find that microbiome-dependent production of endocannabinoid metabolites in the gut stimulates the activity of TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons and thereby elevates dopamine levels in the ventral striatum during exercise. Stimulation of this pathway improves running performance, whereas microbiome depletion, peripheral endocannabinoid receptor inhibition, ablation of spinal afferent neurons or dopamine blockade abrogate exercise capacity. These findings indicate that the rewarding properties of exercise are influenced by gut-derived interoceptive circuits and provide a microbiome-dependent explanation for interindividual variability in exercise performance. Our study also suggests that interoceptomimetic molecules that stimulate the transmission of gut-derived signals to the brain may enhance the motivation for exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that bile acids play important roles in lipid metabolism. In recent decades, bile acids have also been shown to function as signaling molecules via interacting with various receptors. Bile acids circulate continuously through the enterohepatic circulation and go through microbial transformation by gut microbes, and thus bile acids metabolism has profound effects on the liver and intestinal tissues as well as the gut microbiota. Farnesoid X receptor and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 are two pivotal bile acid receptors that highly expressed in the intestinal tissues, and they have emerged as pivotal regulators in bile acids metabolism, innate immunity and inflammatory responses. There is considerable interest in manipulating the metabolism of bile acids and the expression of bile acid receptors as this may be a promising strategy to regulate intestinal health and disease. This review aims to summarize the roles of bile acids and their receptors in regulation of gut health and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immune mechanism of gut microbiota and its metabolites in the occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with unusual changes in the human gut microbiota, most commonly coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, hypertension, and heart failure. Immune mechanisms maintain a dynamic balance between the gut microbiota and the host immune system. When one side changes and the balance is disrupted, different degrees of damage are inflicted on the host and a diseased state gradually develops over time. This review summarizes the immune mechanism of the gut microbiota and its metabolites in the occurrence of common CVDs, discusses the relationship between gut-heart axis dysfunction and the progression of CVD, and lists the currently effective methods of regulating the gut microbiota for the treatment of CVDs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; The clinical efficacy of Yiqi Sanjie (YQSJ) formula in the treatment of stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) has been demonstrated. However, the underlying antitumor mechanisms remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; The aim of the present study was to comprehensively characterize the molecular and microbiota changes in colon tissues and fecal samples from CRC mice and in CRC cell lines treated with YQSJ or its main active component, peiminine. Integrative tandem mass tag-based proteomics and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics were used to analyze azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced CRC mouse colon tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that 0.8% (57/7568) of all detected tissue proteins and 3.2% (37/1141) of all detected tissue metabolites were significantly changed by YQSJ treatment, with enrichment in ten and six pathways associated with colon proteins and metabolites, respectively. The enriched pathways were related to inflammation, sphingolipid metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism. Metabolomics analysis of fecal samples from YQSJ-treated mice identified 121 altered fecal metabolites and seven enriched pathways including protein digestion and absorption pathway. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis of fecal samples indicated that YQSJ restored the CRC mouse microbiota structure by increasing the levels of beneficial bacteria such as Ruminococcus_1 and Prevotellaceae_UCG_001. In HCT-116 cells treated with peiminine, data-independent acquisition-based proteomics analysis showed that 1073 of the 7152 identified proteins were significantly altered and involved in 33 pathways including DNA damage repair, ferroptosis, and TGF-β signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The present study identified key regulatory elements (proteins/metabolites/bacteria) and pathways involved in the antitumor mechanisms of YQSJ, suggesting new potential therapeutic targets in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maturation and specialization of group 2 innate lymphoid cells through the lung-gut axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are abundant in mucosal tissues. They serve critical functions in anti-pathogen response and tissue homeostasis. However, the heterogenous composition of ILCs in mucosal sites and their various maturation trajectories are less well known. In this study, we characterize ILC types and functions from both the lung and the small intestine, and identify their tissue-specific markers. We find that ILC2s residing in the lung express CCR2, whereas intestinal ILC2s express CCR4. Through the use of CCR2 and CCR4 reporter mice, we show that ILC2s undergo translocation via the lung-gut axis upon IL-33 treatment. This trajectory of ILC2s is also observed at the postnatal stage. Allergen-induced activation of lung ILC2s affects the homeostasis of gut ILC2s. Together, our findings implicate that ILCs display tissue-specific features in both the lung and gut, and ILC2s mature along the lung-gut axis in particular homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ruminococcus gnavus plays a pathogenic role in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome by increasing serotonin biosynthesis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), a globally prevalent functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, is associated with elevated serotonin that increases gut motility. While anecdotal evidence suggests that the gut microbiota contributes to serotonin biosynthesis, mechanistic insights are limited. We determined that the bacterium Ruminococcus gnavus plays a pathogenic role in IBS-D. Monocolonization of germ-free mice with R. gnavus induced IBS-D-like symptoms, including increased GI transit and colonic secretion, by stimulating the production of peripheral serotonin. R. gnavus-mediated catabolism of dietary phenylalanine and tryptophan generated phenethylamine and tryptamine that directly stimulated serotonin biosynthesis in intestinal enterochromaffin cells via a mechanism involving activation of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). This R. gnavus-driven increase in serotonin levels elevated GI transit and colonic secretion but was abrogated upon TAAR1 inhibition. Collectively, our study provides molecular and pathogenetic insights into how gut microbial metabolites derived from dietary essential amino acids affect serotonin-dependent control of gut motility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mannose metabolism normalizes gut homeostasis by blocking the TNF-α-mediated proinflammatory circuit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mannose is a naturally occurring sugar widely consumed in the daily diet; however, mechanistic insights into how mannose metabolism affects intestinal inflammation remain lacking. Herein, we reported that mannose supplementation ameliorated colitis development and promoted colitis recovery. Macrophage-secreted inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-α, induced pathological endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), which was prevented by mannose via normalization of protein N-glycosylation. By preserving epithelial integrity, mannose reduced the inflammatory activation of colonic macrophages. On the other hand, mannose directly suppressed macrophage TNF-α production translationally by reducing the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate level, thus promoting GAPDH binding to TNF-α mRNA. Additionally, we found dysregulated mannose metabolism in the colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, we revealed that activating PMM2 activity with epalrestat, a clinically approved drug for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, elicited further sensitization to the therapeutic effect of mannose. Therefore, mannose metabolism prevents TNF-α-mediated pathogenic crosstalk between IECs and intestinal macrophages, thereby normalizing aberrant immunometabolism in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treg cells acquire distinct transcriptional properties to suppress specific inflammatory responses. Transcription characteristics of Treg cells are regulated by epigenetic modifications, the mechanism of which remains obscure. Here, we report that Setd2, a histone H3K36 methyltransferase, is important for the survival and suppressive function of Treg cells, especially those from the intestine. Setd2 supports GATA3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;ST2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intestinal thymic-derived Treg (tTreg) cells by facilitating the expression and reciprocal relationship of GATA3 and ST2 in tTreg cells. IL-33 preferentially boosts Th2 cells rather than GATA3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Treg cells in Foxp3&lt;sup&gt;Cre-YFP&lt;/sup&gt;Setd2&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt; mice, corroborating the constraint of Th2 responses by Setd2 expression in Treg cells. SETD2 sustains GATA3 expression in human Treg cells, and SETD2 expression is increased in Treg cells from human colorectal cancer tissues. Epigenetically, Setd2 regulates the transcription of target genes (including &lt;em&gt;Il1rl1&lt;/em&gt;) by modulating the activity of promoters and intragenic enhancers where H3K36me3 is typically deposited. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of Treg cells and intestinal immunity by Setd2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis has emerged as a promising target for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. Although disrupting glutathione metabolism is the primary strategy for ferroptosis induction, additional key pathways link ferroptosis to CRC pathogenesis. Here, we discuss arachidonic acid (AA), energy metabolism, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and Hippo signaling, summarize key findings, and propose new conceptual avenues for CRC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Mounting experimental evidence has shown that the gut microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of mastitis, and clinical investigations have found that the occurrence of mastitis is correlated with ruminal dysbiosis. However, the underlying mechanism by which the ruminal microbiota participates in the development of mastitis remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In the present study, we found that cows with clinical mastitis had marked systemic inflammation, which was associated with significant ruminal dysbiosis, especially enriched Proteobacteria in the rumen. Ruminal microbiota transplantation from mastitis cows (M-RMT) to mice induced mastitis symptoms in recipient mice along with increased mammary proinflammatory signature activation of the TLR4-cGAS-STING-NF-κB/NLRP3 pathways. M-RMT also induced mucosal inflammation and impaired intestinal barrier integrity, leading to increased endotoxemia and systemic inflammation. Moreover, we showed that M-RMT mirrored ruminal microbiota disruption in the gut of recipient mice, as evidenced by enriched Proteobacteria and similar bacterial functions, which were correlated with most proinflammatory parameters and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in mice. Recurrent low-grade LPS treatment mirrored gut dysbiosis-induced endotoxemia and caused severe mastitis in mice. Furthermore, we found that gut dysbiosis-derived LPS reduced host alkaline phosphatase activity by activating neuraminidase (Neu), which facilitates low-grade LPS exposure and E. coli-induced mastitis in mice. Conversely, treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase or the Neu inhibitor zanamivir alleviated low-grade LPS exposure and E. coli-induced mastitis in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results suggest that ruminal dysbiosis-derived low-grade endotoxemia can cause mastitis and aggravate pathogen-induced mastitis by impairing host anti-inflammatory enzymes, which implies that regulating the ruminal or gut microbiota to prevent low-grade systemic inflammation is a potential strategy for mastitis intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cancer microenvironment, aberrant glycosylation events of ECM proteins and cell surface receptors occur. We developed a protocol to generate 3D bioprinted models of colorectal cancer (CRC) crosslinking hyaluronic acid and gelatin functionalized with three signalling glycans characterized in CRC, 3&amp;rsquo;-Sialylgalactose, 6&amp;rsquo;-Sialylgalactose and 2&amp;rsquo;-Fucosylgalactose. The crosslinking, performed exploiting azide functionalized gelatin and hyaluronic acid and 4arm-PEG-dibenzocyclooctyne, resulted in biocompatible hydrogels that were 3D bioprinted with commercial CRC cells HT-29 and patient derived CRC tumoroids. The glycosylated hydrogels showed good 3D printability, biocompatibility and stability over the time. SEM and synchrotron radiation SAXS/WAXS analysis revealed the influence of glycosylation in the construct morphology, whereas MALDI-MS imaging showed that protein profiles of tumoroid cells vary with glycosylation, indicating that sialylation and fucosylation of ECM proteins induce diverse alterations to the proteome of the tumoroid and surrounding cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal dysbiosis mediates cognitive impairment via the intestine and brain NLRP3 inflammasome activation in chronic sleep deprivation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence suggests the involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in cognitive impairment induced by sleep deprivation (SD), however how the microbiota-gut-brain axis work remains elusive. Here, we discovered that chronic SD induced intestinal dysbiosis, activated NLRP3 inflammasome in the colon and brain, destructed intestinal/blood-brain barrier, and impaired cognitive function in mice. Transplantation of &amp;ldquo;SD microbiota&amp;rdquo; could almost mimic the pathological and behavioral changes caused by chronic SD. Furthermore, all the behavioral and pathological abnormalities were practically reversed in chronic sleep-deprived NLRP3-/- mice. Regional knockdown NLRP3 expression in the gut and hippocampus, respectively. We observed that down-regulation of NLRP3 in the hippocampus inhibited neuroinflammation, and ameliorated synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment induced by chronic SD. More intriguingly, the down-regulation of NLRP3 in the gut protected the intestinal barrier, attenuated the levels of peripheral inflammatory factors, down-regulated the expression of NLRP3 in the brain, and improved cognitive function in chronic SD mice. Our results identified gut microbiota as a driver in chronic SD and highlighted the NLRP3 inflammasome as a key regulator within the microbiota-gut-brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mutant RIG-I enhances cancer-related inflammation through activation of circRIG-I signaling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIG-I/DDX58 plays a key role in host innate immunity. However, its therapeutic potential for inflammation-related cancers remains to be explored. Here we identify frameshift germline mutations of RIG-I occurring in patients with colon cancer. Accordingly, Rig-ifs/fs mice bearing a frameshift mutant Rig-i exhibit increased susceptibility to colitis-related colon cancer as well as enhanced inflammatory response to chemical, virus or bacteria. In addition to interruption of Rig-i mRNA translation, the Rig-i mutation changes the secondary structure of Rig-i pre-mRNA and impairs its association with DHX9, consequently inducing a circular RNA generation from Rig-i transcript, thereby, designated as circRIG-I. CircRIG-I is frequently upregulated in colon cancers and its upregulation predicts poor outcome of colon cancer. Mechanistically, circRIG-I interacts with DDX3X, which in turn stimulates MAVS/TRAF5/TBK1 signaling cascade, eventually activating IRF3-mediated type I IFN transcription and aggravating inflammatory damage. Reciprocally, all-trans retinoic acid acts as a DHX9 agonist, ameliorates immunopathology through suppression of circRIG-I biogenesis. Collectively, our results provide insight into mutant RIG-I action and propose a potential strategy for the treatment of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thiram-induced hyperglycemia causes tibial dyschondroplasia by triggering aberrant ECM remodeling via the gut-pancreas axis in broiler chickens</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pesticide thiram is widely used in agriculture and has been demonstrated to cause tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) in birds. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This work used multi-omics analysis to evaluate the molecular pathways of TD in broilers that were exposed to low level of thiram. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic revealed thiram activity in enhancing pathological ECM remodeling via attenuating the glycolysis pathway and activating the hexosamine and glucuronic acid pathways. Intriguingly, we found hyperglycemia as a crucial factor for ECM overproduction, which resulted in the development of TD. We further demonstrated that high glucose levels are caused by islet secretion dysfunction in thiram-treated broilers. A combination of factors, including lipid disorder, low-grade inflammation, and gut flora disturbance, might contribute to the dysregulation of insulin secretion. The current work revealed the underlying toxicological mechanisms of thiram-induced tibial dyschondroplasia through blood glucose disorder via the gut-pancreas axis in chickens for the first time, which makes it easier to figure out the health risks of pesticides for worldwide policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interrogation of the mammalian gut-brain axis using LC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics with in vitro bacterial and organoid cultures and in vivo gnotobiotic mouse models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in the communication between the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system, known as the gut-brain axis, has prompted the development of quantitative analytical platforms to analyze microbe- and host-derived signals. This protocol enables investigations into connections between microbial colonization and intestinal and brain neurotransmitters and contains strategies for the comprehensive evaluation of metabolites in in vitro (organoids) and in vivo mouse model systems. Here we present an optimized workflow that includes procedures for preparing these gut-brain axis model systems: (stage 1) growth of microbes in defined media; (stage 2) microinjection of intestinal organoids; and (stage 3) generation of animal models including germ-free (no microbes), specific-pathogen-free (complete gut microbiota) and specific-pathogen-free re-conventionalized (germ-free mice associated with a complete gut microbiota from a specific-pathogen-free mouse), and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium dentium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides ovatus&lt;/em&gt; mono-associated mice (germ-free mice colonized with a single gut microbe). We describe targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomics methods for analyzing microbially derived short-chain fatty acids and neurotransmitters from these samples. Unlike other protocols that commonly examine only stool samples, this protocol includes bacterial cultures, organoid cultures and in vivo samples, in addition to monitoring the metabolite content of stool samples. The incorporation of three experimental models (microbes, organoids and animals) enhances the impact of this protocol. The protocol requires 3 weeks of murine colonization with microbes and ~1-2 weeks for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based instrumental and quantitative analysis, and sample post-processing and normalization.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metastatic recurrence in colorectal cancer arises from residual EMP1&#43; cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36352230/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 30-40% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) undergoing curative resection of the primary tumour will develop metastases in the subsequent years. Therapies to prevent disease relapse remain an unmet medical need. Here we uncover the identity and features of the residual tumour cells responsible for CRC relapse. An analysis of single-cell transcriptomes of samples from patients with CRC revealed that the majority of genes associated with a poor prognosis are expressed by a unique tumour cell population that we named high-relapse cells (HRCs). We established a human-like mouse model of microsatellite-stable CRC that undergoes metastatic relapse after surgical resection of the primary tumour. Residual HRCs occult in mouse livers after primary CRC surgery gave rise to multiple cell types over time, including LGR5&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stem-like tumour cells, and caused overt metastatic disease. Using Emp1 (encoding epithelial membrane protein 1) as a marker gene for HRCs, we tracked and selectively eliminated this cell population. Genetic ablation of EMP1&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cells prevented metastatic recurrence and mice remained disease-free after surgery. We also found that HRC-rich micrometastases were infiltrated with T cells, yet became progressively immune-excluded during outgrowth. Treatment with neoadjuvant immunotherapy eliminated residual metastatic cells and prevented mice from relapsing after surgery. Together, our findings reveal the cell-state dynamics of residual disease in CRC and anticipate that therapies targeting HRCs may help to avoid metastatic relapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) offers unique opportunities to explore the gut-liver axis owing to the close association between liver disease and colonic inflammation. It is well established that the gut microbiota in people with PSC differs from that of healthy individuals, but details of the microbial factors that demarcate PSC from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) without PSC are poorly understood. In this Review, we aim to provide an overview of the latest literature on the gut microbiome in PSC and PSC with IBD, critically examining hypotheses on how microorganisms could contribute to the pathogenesis of PSC. A particular emphasis will be put on pathogenic features of the gut microbiota that might explain the occurrence of bile duct inflammation and liver disease in the context of IBD, and we postulate the potential existence of a specific yet unknown factor related to the gut-liver axis as causative in PSC. Available data are scrutinized in the perspective of therapeutic approaches related to the gut-liver axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The intestinal barrier in disorders of the central nervous system</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intestinal barrier, which primarily consists of a mucus layer, an epithelial barrier, and a gut vascular barrier, has a crucial role in health and disease by facilitating nutrient absorption and preventing the entry of pathogens. The intestinal barrier is in close contact with gut microbiota on its luminal side and with enteric neurons and glial cells on its tissue side. Mounting evidence now suggests that the intestinal barrier is compromised not only in digestive disorders, but also in disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), such as Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease, autism spectrum disorder, depression, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease. After providing an overview of the structure and functions of the intestinal barrier, we review existing preclinical and clinical studies supporting the notion that intestinal barrier dysfunction is present in neurological, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. On the basis of this evidence, we discuss the mechanisms that possibly link gut barrier dysfunction and CNS disorders and the potential impact that evaluating enteric barriers in brain disorders could have on clinical practice, in terms of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Commensal microbiota from patients with inflammatory bowel disease produce genotoxic metabolites</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36302024/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gut microbiota can potentially contribute to the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) by producing small-molecule genotoxins. For example, select commensal &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; strains produce the canonical microbiota-derived genotoxin colibactin, which engenders the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in intestinal epithelial cells and exacerbates CRC in mouse models. Furthermore, human CRCs harbor colibactin-associated mutational signatures, implying a direct role for microbiota-induced DNA damage in CRC. However, the impacts of microbiota-derived genotoxins beyond colibactin remain largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the extensive diversity of small-molecule metabolites produced by bacteria, we hypothesized that additional taxa from the human gut microbiome might produce previously undiscovered small molecules that cause DNA damage in host cells. Identifying and characterizing such genotoxins and their respective biosynthetic pathways may reveal causal roles of gut microbes in shaping host biology and disease susceptibility. Thus, we designed a large-scale electrophoresis-based DNA damage screening pipeline to evaluate the genotoxicity of a collection of more than 100 gut commensals isolated from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified diverse bacteria from the human microbiota whose small-molecule metabolites caused genotoxicity in both cell-free and cell-based DNA damage assays. For example, small-molecule metabolites from gram-positive bacteria (including &lt;em&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Clostridium ramosum&lt;/em&gt; strains) and gram-negative bacteria (including multiple &lt;em&gt;Morganella morganii&lt;/em&gt; strains) directly damaged DNA in cell-free assays and induced the expression of the DSB marker γ-H2AX and cell-cycle arrest in epithelial cells. However, the DNA damage patterns caused by these metabolites were distinct from colibactin-induced cross-links, and these isolates lacked the biosynthetic machinery to produce colibactin or other known genotoxins. These data thus implied the existence of previously unrecognized microbiota-derived genotoxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; is enriched in the gut microbiota of both IBD and CRC patients. Using a combination of comparative metabolomics and bioactivity-guided natural product-discovery techniques, we discovered a family of &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt;-derived small-molecule genotoxins—termed the indolimines—that elicited DNA damage in cell-based and cell-free assays. Furthermore, we identified a previously uncharacterized bacterial decarboxylase (annotated as an aspartate aminotransferase encoded by the &lt;em&gt;aat&lt;/em&gt; gene) that was essential for indolimine synthesis and constructed an isogenic aat mutant &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; that lacked genotoxicity in both cell-free and cell-based DNA damage assays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with the non–indolimine-producing mutant, wild-type &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; caused increased intestinal permeability and induced transcriptional signatures associated with abnormal DNA replication and intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in gnotobiotic mice. Furthermore, indolimine-producing &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; induced increased colonic tumor burden in the context of a mock microbial community in a mouse model of CRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging function-based assessments of the microbiome, we uncovered the existence of a broader universe of microbiota-derived small-molecule genotoxins. We found that diverse bacterial strains isolated from IBD patients exhibited DNA-damaging activities and discovered a previously undescribed family of genotoxins, termed the indolimines, produced by the IBD- and CRC-associated species &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt;. Indolimine-producing &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; caused increased intestinal permeability and exacerbated colon tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic mice. Overall, these studies imply an expanded role for microbiota-derived genotoxins in shaping host biology and disease susceptibility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Novel Protein Encoded by Exosomal CircATG4B Induces Oxaliplatin Resistance in Colorectal Cancer by Promoting Autophagy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxaliplatin is commonly used in chemotherapeutic regimens for colorectal cancer (CRC) after surgical resection. However, acquired chemoresistance seriously affects the curative effect in CRC patients, and the mechanism is still unclear. Here, a circular RNA, circATG4B is identified, which plays an important role in oxaliplatin resistance in CRC. circATG4B expression is found to be increased in exosomes secreted by oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells. In addition, the results suggest that circATG4B induces oxaliplatin resistance by promoting autophagy. Further in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the effect of circATG4B is attributed to its potential to encode a novel protein, circATG4B-222aa. Next, circATG4B-222aa is found to function as a decoy to competitively interact with TMED10 and prevent TMED10 from binding to ATG4B, which leads to increased autophagy followed by induction of chemoresistance. Therefore, this study reveals that exosomal circATG4B participates in the decreased chemosensitivity of CRC cells, providing a new rationale for a potential therapeutic target for oxaliplatin resistance in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DCLK1 Suppresses Tumor-Specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Function Through Recruitment of MDSCs via the CXCL1-CXCR2 Axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36309200/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36309200/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; Aims&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gastrointestinal cancer stem cell marker doublecortin-like kinase (DCLK1) is strongly associated with poor outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although DCLK1’s regulatory effect on the tumor immune microenvironment has been hypothesized, its mode of action has not been shown previously in vivo, which hampers the potential intervention based on this molecule for clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To define the immunomodulatory mechanisms of DCLK1 in vivo, we generated DCLK1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; tumor cells by Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) and developed subcutaneous and intestinal orthotopic transplantation tumor models. Tumor tissues were harvested and subjected to immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations, tumor myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) sorting by isolation kit and then co-culture with spleen T cells, and RNA sequencing for transcriptomic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that DCLK1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; tumor cells lose their tumorigenicity under immune surveillance. Failed tumor establishment of DCLK1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; was associated with an increase in infiltration of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and effector CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, and reduced numbers of MDSCs in the tumor tissue. Furthermore, DCLK1 promoted the up-regulation of C-X-C motif ligand 1, which recruits MDSCs in CRC through chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 2. The ability of in vivo tumor growth of DCLK1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; tumor cells was rescued by C-X-C motif ligand 1 overexpression. Collectively, we validated that DCLK1 promotes tumor growth in CRC through recruitment of T-cell–suppressive MDSCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DCLK1-mediated immune suppression in tumor models allows escaping from the host’s antitumor response. Because DCLK1 is one of the most common markers in gastrointestinal tumors, these results identify a precise therapeutic target for related clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestine-specific removal of DAF-2 nearly doubles lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans with little fitness cost</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36284093/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine years following the breakthrough discovery that a single-gene mutation of daf-2 doubles Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan, it remains unclear where this insulin/IGF-1 receptor gene is expressed and where it acts to regulate ageing. Using knock-in fluorescent reporters, we determined that daf-2 and its downstream transcription factor daf-16 are expressed ubiquitously. Using tissue-specific targeted protein degradation, we determined that intracellular DAF-2-to-DAF-16 signaling in the intestine plays a major role in lifespan regulation, while that in the hypodermis, neurons, and germline plays a minor role. Notably, intestine-specific loss of DAF-2 activates DAF-16 in and outside the intestine, causes almost no adverse effects on development and reproduction, and extends lifespan by 94% in a way that partly requires non-intestinal DAF-16. Consistent with intestine supplying nutrients to the entire body, evidence from this and other studies suggests that altered metabolism, particularly down-regulation of protein and RNA synthesis, mediates longevity by reduction of insulin/IGF-1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of environmental factors that promote intestinal inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36266581/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide association studies have identified risk loci linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-a complex chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. The increasing prevalence of IBD in industrialized countries and the augmented disease risk observed in migrants who move into areas of higher disease prevalence suggest that environmental factors are also important determinants of IBD susceptibility and severity. However, the identification of environmental factors relevant to IBD and the mechanisms by which they influence disease has been hampered by the lack of platforms for their systematic investigation. Here we describe an integrated systems approach, combining publicly available databases, zebrafish chemical screens, machine learning and mouse preclinical models to identify environmental factors that control intestinal inflammation. This approach established that the herbicide propyzamide increases inflammation in the small and large intestine. Moreover, we show that an AHR-NF-κB-C/EBPβ signalling axis operates in T cells and dendritic cells to promote intestinal inflammation, and is targeted by propyzamide. In conclusion, we developed a pipeline for the identification of environmental factors and mechanisms of pathogenesis in IBD and, potentially, other inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut bacteria alleviate smoking-related NASH by degrading gut nicotine</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36261549/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tobacco smoking is positively correlated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the underlying mechanism for this association is unclear. Here we report that nicotine accumulates in the intestine during tobacco smoking and activates intestinal AMPKα. We identify the gut bacterium Bacteroides xylanisolvens as an effective nicotine degrader. Colonization of B.xylanisolvens reduces intestinal nicotine concentrations in nicotine-exposed mice, and it improves nicotine-exacerbated NAFLD progression. Mechanistically, AMPKα promotes the phosphorylation of sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3), stabilizing the latter and therefore increasing intestinal ceramide formation, which contributes to NAFLD progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Our results establish a role for intestinal nicotine accumulation in NAFLD progression and reveal an endogenous bacterium in the human intestine with the ability to metabolize nicotine. These findings suggest a possible route to reduce tobacco smoking-exacerbated NAFLD progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiota-derived succinate aggravates acute lung injury after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36229053/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36229053/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Gut microbiota and their metabolic byproducts act as important modulators of the gut-lung axis. This study aimed to define the role of succinate, a key microbiota metabolite, in intestinal I/R-induced ALI progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Gut and lung microbiota of mice subjected to intestinal I/R were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Succinate level alterations were measured in Germ-free (GF) mice or conventional mice treated with antibiotics. Succinate-induced alveolar macrophage polarisation and its effects on alveolar epithelial apoptosis were evaluated in succinate receptor1 (&lt;em&gt;Sucnr1&lt;/em&gt;)-deficient mice and in murine alveolar macrophages transfected with &lt;em&gt;Sucnr1&lt;/em&gt;-siRNA. Succinate levels were measured in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, including intestinal I/R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Succinate accumulated in lungs after intestinal I/R, and this was associated with an imbalance of succinate-producing and succinate-consuming bacteria in the gut, but not the lungs. Succinate accumulation was absent in GF mice and was reversed by gut microbiota depletion with antibiotics, indicating that gut microbiota are a source of lung succinate. Moreover, succinate promoted alveolar macrophage polarisation, alveolar epithelial apoptosis, and lung injury during intestinal I/R. Conversely, knockdown of &lt;em&gt;Sucnr1&lt;/em&gt; or blockage of SUCNR1 &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; reversed the effects of succinate by modulating PI3K-AKT/HIF-1α pathway. Plasma succinate levels significantly correlated with intestinal I/R-related lung injury after cardiopulmonary bypass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Gut microbiota-derived succinate exacerbates intestinal I/R-induced ALI through SUCNR1-dependent alveolar macrophage polarisation, identifying succinate as a novel target for gut-derived ALI in critically ill patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>gutMDisorder v2.0: a comprehensive database for dysbiosis of gut microbiota in phenotypes and interventions</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36215029/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gut microbiota plays a significant role in maintaining host health, and conversely, disorders potentially lead to dysbiosis, an imbalance in the composition of the gut microbial community. Intervention approaches, such as medications, diets, and several others, also alter the gut microbiota in either a beneficial or harmful direction. In 2020, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bio-annotation.cn/gutMDisorder/home.dhtml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gutMDisorder&lt;/a&gt; was developed to facilitate researchers in the investigation of dysbiosis of gut microbes as occurs in various disorders as well as with therapeutic interventions. The database has been updated this year, following revision of previous publications and newly published reports to manually integrate confirmed associations under multitudinous conditions. Additionally, the microbial contents of downloaded gut microbial raw sequencing data were annotated, the metadata of the corresponding hosts were manually curated, and the interactive charts were developed to enhance visualization. The improvements have assembled into &lt;a href=&#34;http://bio-annotation.cn/gutMDisorder/home.dhtml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gutMDisorder&lt;/a&gt; v2.0, a more advanced search engine and an upgraded web interface.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell Transcriptomics Reveals Early Molecular and Immune Alterations Underlying the Serrated Neoplasia Pathway Toward Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36216310/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Approximately one-third of colorectal cancers develop from serrated lesions (SLs), including hyperplastic polyp (HP), sessile serrated lesion (SSL), traditional serrated adenoma (TSA), and SSL with dysplasia (SSLD) through the serrated neoplasia pathway, which progresses faster than the conventional adenoma-carcinoma pathway. We sought to depict the currently unclarified molecular and immune alterations by the single-cell landscape in SLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 16 SLs (including 4 proximal HPs, 5 SSLs, 2 SSLDs, and 5 TSAs) vs 3 normal colonic tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 60,568 high-quality cells were obtained. Two distinct epithelial clusters with redox imbalance in SLs were observed, along with upregulation of tumor-promoting SerpinB6 that regulated ROS level. Epithelial clusters of SSL and TSA showed distinct molecular features: SSL-specific epithelium manifested overexpressed proliferative markers with Notch pathway activation, whereas TSA-specific epithelium showed Paneth cell metaplasia with aberrant lysozyme expression. As for immune contexture, enhanced cytotoxic activity of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells was observed in SLs; it was mainly attributable to increased proportion of CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tissue-resident memory T cells, which might be regulated by retinoic acid metabolism. Microenvironment of SLs was generally immune-activated, whereas some immunosuppressive cells (regulatory T cells, anti-inflammatory macrophages, MDK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;IgA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; plasma cells, MMP11-secreting PDGFRA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts) also emerged at early stage and further accumulated in SSLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Epithelial, immune, and stromal components in the serrated pathway undergo fundamental alterations. Future molecular subtypes of SLs and potential immune therapy might be developed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mucus protects the epithelial cells of the digestive and respiratory tracts from pathogens and other hazards. Progress in determining the molecular mechanisms of mucus barrier function has been limited by the lack of high-resolution structural information on mucins, the giant, secreted, gel-forming glycoproteins that are the major constituents of mucus. Here, we report how mucin structures we determined enabled the discovery of an unanticipated protective role of mucus: managing the toxic transition metal copper. Using two juxtaposed copper binding sites, one for Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the other for Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;, the intestinal mucin, MUC2, prevents copper toxicity by blocking futile redox cycling and the squandering of dietary antioxidants, while nevertheless permitting uptake of this important trace metal into cells. These findings emphasize the value of molecular structure in advancing mucosal biology, while introducing mucins, produced in massive quantities to guard extensive mucosal surfaces, as extracellular copper chaperones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiota-stem cell niche crosstalk: A new territory for maintaining intestinal homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/imt2.54/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are protected by their niche and are regulated by Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, and Notch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISCs and their relationship with intestinal microbiota provide a feasible pathway to alleviate intestinal diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diverse bacteria-related postbiotics regulate ISCs and maintain their homeostasis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intestinal epithelium undergoes rapid cellular turnover, relying on the local niche, to support intestinal stem cells (ISCs) function and self-renewal. Research into the association between ISCs and disease continues to expand at a rapid rate. However, the detailed interaction of ISCs and gut microbes remains to be elucidated. Thus, this review witnessed major advances in the crosstalk between ISCs and gut microbes, delivering key insights into (1) construction of ISC niche and molecular mechanism of how to jointly govern epithelial homeostasis and protect against intestinal diseases with the participation of Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, and Notch; (2) differentiation fate of ISCs affect the gut microbiota. Meanwhile, the presence of intestinal microbes also regulates ISC function; (3) microbiota regulation on ISCs by Wnt and Notch signals through pattern recognition receptors; (4) how do specific microbiota-related postbiotics influence ISCs to maintain intestinal epithelial regeneration and homeostasis that provide insights into a promising alternative therapeutic method for intestinal diseases. Considering the detailed interaction is still unclear, it is necessary to further explore the regulatory role of gut microbiota on ISCs to utilize microbes to alleviate gut disorders. Furthermore, these major advances collectively drive us ever closer to breakthroughs in regenerative medicine and cancer treatment by microbial transplantation in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Costunolide covalently targets NACHT domain of NLRP3 to inhibit inflammasome activation and alleviate NLRP3-driven inflammatory diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NLRP3 inflammasome’s core and most specific protein, NLRP3, has a variety of functions in inflammation-driven diseases. Costunolide (COS) is the major active ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicinal herb &lt;em&gt;Saussurea lappa&lt;/em&gt; and has anti-inflammatory activity, but the principal mechanism and molecular target of COS remain unclear. Here, we show that COS covalently binds to cysteine 598 in NACHT domain of NLRP3, altering the ATPase activity and assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome. We declare COS’s great anti-inflammasome efficacy in macrophages and disease models of gouty arthritis and ulcerative colitis via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We also reveal that the α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone motif in sesquiterpene lactone is the certain active group in inhibiting NLRP3 activation. Taken together, NLRP3 is identified as a direct target of COS for its anti-inflammasome activity. COS, especially the α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone motif in COS structure, might be used to design and produce novel NLRP3 inhibitors as a lead compound.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal Microbiota-derived Propionic Acid Protects against Zinc Oxide Nanoparticle-induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150095/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of nanotechnology, the risks of accidental and/or occupational exposure to zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) are increasing. Inhalation of ZnONPs induces metal fume fever in humans and acute lung injury (ALI) in animal models. Although the intestinal microbiota is considered an important modulator of various diseases, the role and mechanism of intestinal microbiota in the pathology of ZnONP-induced ALI are unclear. Herein, we established an intratracheal instillation of a ZnONP-induced ALI mouse model and found that the inhalation of ZnONPs caused ALI along with a perturbation of intestinal flora. Antibiotic cocktail treatment-mediated depletion of intestinal microbiota aggravated ZnONP-induced ALI, and in contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation-mediated restoration of intestinal microbiota exerted the opposite effects. A decrease in short-chain fatty acids, the intestinal microbiota-derived metabolites in the plasma-in particular, acetic acid and propionic acid-occurred after exposure to ZnONPs. It is important to note that supplementation with propionic acid, but not acetic acid, ameliorated ZnONP-induced ALI. We also showed that the source of inflammatory cytokines might partially be the infiltration of macrophages. Supplementation with propionic acid was found to act on macrophages through the receptor GPR43, because knockdown of GPR43 sharply reversed the protective effects of propionic acid during the ZnONP-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress in both primary alveolar macrophages and RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines. Altogether, a novel gut-lung axis mechanism is revealed in which intestinal microbiota and their derived metabolite propionic acid play protective roles against ZnONP-induced ALI and suggest that fecal microbiota transplantation and supplementation with propionic acid are potential remedy strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An in situ analysis pipeline for initial host-pathogen interactions reveals signatures of human colorectal HIV transmission</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;In situ&lt;/em&gt; quantification pipeline of early host-pathogen interactions in human tissue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial HIV enrichment in mucosal DCs and submucosal macrophages, but not CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HIV preferentially localizes to lymphoid aggregates, mediating submucosal virus entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HIV rapidly alters cellular spatial organization to maximize uptake and infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial immune response to HIV determines transmission. However, due to technical limitations we still do not have a comparative map of early mucosal transmission events. By combining RNAscope, cyclic immunofluorescence, and image analysis tools, we quantify HIV transmission signatures in intact human colorectal explants within 2 h of topical exposure. We map HIV enrichment to mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) and submucosal macrophages, but not CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, the primary targets of downstream infection. HIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs accumulate near and within lymphoid aggregates, which act as early sanctuaries of high viral titers while facilitating HIV passage to the submucosa. Finally, HIV entry induces recruitment and clustering of target cells, facilitating DC- and macrophage-mediated HIV transfer and enhanced infection of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. These data demonstrate a rapid response to HIV structured to maximize the likelihood of mucosal infection and provide a framework for in situ studies of host-pathogen interactions and immune-mediated pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rectal administration of butyrate ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis in mice through induction of hepatocyte growth factor in the colon via the HDAC-PPARγ pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36116532/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butyrate, given by oral administration or in drinking water, has been shown to improve experimental pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in mice despite of very low bioavailability. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics disconnection attracts us to explore its anti-PF mechanism in view of the intestinal expression of anti-PF factors. In bleomycin-induced PF in mice, rectal administration of butyrate (500 mg/kg) exhibited a significant anti-PF effect, with a maximum plasma concentration largely lower than the minimum effective concentration (1 mM) at which butyrate inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory factors by lung epithelial cells and the production of extracellular matrix by lung fibroblasts. The rectal administration of butyrate significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the colons of PF mice, but showed no significant effect on the mRNA expression of HGF in the small intestines, lungs and livers. In colon epithelial cells, the monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHC) abrogated butyrate-induced expression of HGF, indicating that butyrate functions through entering into cells. Butyrate showed no significant effect on the histone acetylation in the promoter region of HGF, suggesting that it promotes HGF expression not by directly affecting the histone deacetylation of HGF but by other pathways. GW9662, the inhibitor of PPARγ, significantly attenuated the effect of butyrate to promote the mRNA expression of HGF. Butyrate was able to enhance the acetylation of PPARγ, and a targeted mutation of lysine at the position 240 (K240) of PPARγ markedly diminished the induction of butyrate on HGF expression, suggesting that butyrate promoted HGF expression in colon epithelial cells by upregulating PPARγ K240 acetylation. In summary, rectal administration of butyrate promotes the expression of HGF in colonic epithelial cells through upregulating PPARγ acetylation via inhibition of HDAC activity. The findings of the present study provide a reasonable explanation for the anti-PF action mode of butyrate based on the &amp;rsquo;lung-gut axis&amp;rsquo;, and found that intestine-derived butyrate and HGF may be involved in the modulation of the occurrence and progression of PF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 exposure altered gut microbiome and influences the balance of Th17/Treg cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The changes of gut microbiome and the imbalance of Th17/Treg cell are critical mechanism of PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The administration of Probiotics regulating Th17/Treg cell balance and gut microbiome attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imbalance of intestinal microbiota and inflammatory response is crucial in the development of lung injury induced by PM2.5. In recent years, probiotics have attracted great attention for their health benefits in inflammatory diseases and regulating intestinal balance, but their intricate mechanisms need further experiments to elucidate. In our research, a rat lung damage model induced by PM2.5 exposure in real environment was established to explore the protective properties of probiotics on PM2.5 exposure injury and its related mechanism. The results indicated that compared with the AF control group, rats in the PM2.5 group gained weight slowly, ate less and had yellow hair. The results of pathological and immunohistochemical examinations showed that the inflammatory infiltration of lung tissue was alleviated after probiotic treatment. The Lung function results also showed the improvement effects of probiotics administration. In addition, probiotics could promote the balance of Th17 and Treg cells, inhibit cytokines expression (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17A), and increase the concentration of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10, TGF-β). In addition, 16 S rRNA sequence analysis showed that probiotic treatment could reduce microbiota abundance and diversity, increase the abundance of possible beneficial bacteria, and decrease the abundance of bacteria associated with inflammation. In general, probiotic intervention was found to have preventive effects on the occurrence of PM2.5 induced pathological injury, and the mechanism was associate with to the inhibition of inflammatory response, regulation of Th17/Treg balance and maintenance of intestinal internal environment stability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Copper-olsalazine metal-organic frameworks as a nanocatalyst and epigenetic modulator for efficient inhibition of colorectal cancer growth and metastasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36087871/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the extensive explorations of nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (nanoMOFs) in drug delivery, the intrinsic bioactivity of nanoMOFs, such as anticancer activity, is severely underestimated owing to the overlooked integration of the hierarchical components including nanosized MOFs and molecular-level organic ligands and metal-organic complexes. Herein, we propose a de novo design of multifunctional bioactive nanoMOFs ranging from molecular to nanoscale level, and demonstrate this proof-of-concept by a copper-olsalazine (Olsa, a clinically approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease, here as a bioactive linker and DNA hypomethylating agent) nanoMOF displaying a multifaceted anticancer mechanism: (1) Cu-Olsa nanoMOF-mediated redox dyshomeostasis for enhanced catalytic tumor therapy, (2) targeting downregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 by the organic complex of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Olsa, and (3) Olsa-mediated epigenetic regulation. Cu-Olsa nanoMOF displayed an enzyme-like catalytic activity to generate cancericidal species ·OH and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from rich H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in tumors, improved the expression of tumor suppressors TIMP3 and AXIN2 by epigenetic modulation, and fulfilled selective inhibition of colorectal cancer cells over normal cells. The hyaluronic acid-modified nanoMOF further verified the efficient suppression of CT26 colorectal tumor growth and metastasis in murine models. Overall, these results suggest that Olsa-based MOF presents a platform of epigenetic therapy-synergized nanomedicine for efficient cancer treatment and provides a powerful strategy for the design of intrinsically bioactive nanoMOFs. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with intrinsic bioactivities such as anticancer and antibacterial activity are of great interest. Herein, we reported a bioactive copper-olsalazine (Cu-Olsa) nanoMOF as a nanodrug for colorectal cancer treatment. This nanoMOF per se displayed enzyme-like catalytic activity to generate cancericidal species ·OH and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from rich H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in tumors for nanocatalytic tumor therapy. Upon dissociation into small molecular copper-organic complex and olsalazine in cancer cells, COX-2 inhibition and epigenetic modulation were fulfilled for selective inhibition of colorectal cancer growth and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Global burden of colorectal cancer in 2020 and 2040: incidence and mortality estimates from GLOBOCAN</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36604116/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. The geographical and temporal burden of this cancer provides insights into risk factor prevalence and progress in cancer control strategies. We examine the current and future burden of CRC in 185 countries in 2020 and 2040.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Data on CRC cases and deaths were extracted from the GLOBOCAN database for the year 2020. Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates were calculated by sex, country, world region and Human Development Index (HDI) for 185 countries. Age-specific rates were also estimated. The predicted number of cases and deaths in 2040 were calculated based on global demographic projections by HDI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Over 1.9 million new CRC cases and 930 000 deaths were estimated in 2020. Incidence rates were highest in Australia/ New Zealand and European regions (40.6 per 100 000, males) and lowest in several African regions and Southern Asia (4.4 per 100 000, females). Similar patterns were observed for mortality rates, with the highest observed in Eastern Europe (20.2 per 100 000, males) and the lowest in Southern Asia (2.5 per 100 000, females). The burden of CRC is projected to increase to 3.2 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths by 2040 with most cases predicted to occur in high or very high HDI countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; CRC is a highly frequent cancer worldwide, and largely preventable through changes in modifiable risk factors, alongside the detection and removal of precancerous lesions. With increasing rates in transitioning countries and younger adults, there is a pressing need to better understand and act on findings to avert future cases and deaths from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal microbiota metabolizing Houttuynia cordata polysaccharides in H1N1 induced pneumonia mice contributed to Th17/Treg rebalance in gut-lung axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36084869/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus is intricately linked to dysregulation of gut microbiota and host immunity. Previous study revealed that Houttuynia cordata polysaccharides (HCP) exert the therapeutic effect on influenza A virus inducing lung and intestine damage via regulating pulmonary and intestinal mucosal immunity. However, whether this result was due to the regulation of gut microbiota in the gut-lung axis remains unclear. Here, we firstly found that the elimination of gut microbiota using antibiotic cocktails led to both loss of the protective effect of HCP on intestine and lung injury, and reduction of the efficacy on regulating Th17/Treg balance in gut-lung axis. Fecal microbiota transplantation study confirmed that the gut microbiota fermented with HCP under pathological conditions (H1N1 infection) was responsible for reducing pulmonary and intestinal injury. Moreover, the interaction of HCP and gut microbiota under pathological conditions exhibited not only much more abundant gut microbial diversity, but also higher content of the acetate. Our results demonstrated that the underlying mechanism to ameliorate viral pneumonia in mice involving Th17/Treg rebalance via the gut microbiota and HCP metabolite (acetate) metabolized in pneumonia mice. Our results provided a new insight for macromolecular polysaccharides through targeting intestinal microenvironment reducing distant pulmonary infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles from colorectal cancer cells promote metastasis via the NOD1 signalling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36068649/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) have been shown to promote tumour metastasis via sensing tumour cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (EVs). Nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain 1 (NOD1), a cytoplasmic PRR, plays a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) by detecting bacterial products. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of NOD1, following identification of CRC cell-derived EVs (CRC-EVs), to potentiate CRC liver metastasis (CRC-LM), remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that CRC-EVs activate NOD1 in macrophages to initiate secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. NOD1-activated macrophages also promote CRC cell migration, while in a murine model of liver metastasis (LM), NOD1-deficient mice exhibit reduced metastasis following CRC-EV treatment. Furthermore, cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), a small Rho guanosine-5&amp;rsquo;-triphosphate (GTP)ase, is delivered by CRC-EVs into macrophages where it activates NOD1. In addition, EVs from the plasma of patients with CRC-LM mediate NOD1 activation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, high NOD1 expression in tumour tissues is associated with poor prognosis of CRC-LM. Our findings suggest that CRC-EVs activate NOD1 to promote tumour metastasis, thus, NOD1 may serve as a potential target in the diagnosis and treatment of CRC-LM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a major type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which could induce bloody stool, diarrhea, colon atrophy and eventually lead to colorectal cancer. The conventional daily oral administration of drugs only relieve the inflammatory response of colon in the short term, Biological agents such as antibody drugs has proven its efficiency in inhibiting colitis, while the low drug bioavailability means that large doses of antibodies are required, ultimately causing systemic toxicity. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has significant advantages over antibody drugs in terms of safety and efficacy, and it have been widely applied as potential candidates for a variety of inflammation-related diseases. However, oral delivery of siRNA fails to overcome the degradation of the gastrointestinal environment to produce a significant therapeutic effect in ulcerative colitis. Herein, we design the hybrid delivery system that the siRNA loaded MOF encapsulated in the sodium alginate particles to overcome the barriers in the oral process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The hybrid delivery system (SA@MOF-siRNA&lt;sup&gt;TNFα&lt;/sup&gt;) was successfully constructed, and it could not only survive the low pH environment in the stomach and small intestine, but also taken up more by inflammatory macrophages, as well as released much more MOF-siRNA&lt;sup&gt;TNFα&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, SA@MOF-siRNA&lt;sup&gt;TNFα&lt;/sup&gt; tended to enriched and infiltrated into local colon tissues. As a result, SA@MOF-siRNA&lt;sup&gt;TNFα&lt;/sup&gt; significantly reduced the progression of colitis, of which the treated mice did not experience significant weight loss, bloody stools and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We confirmed that the formulation of hydrogel-metal-organic framework hybrids could improve the protection of incorporated payload in the gastric and early small intestine, enhancing the delivery of MOF-siRNA to colon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microbiota manipulation to increase macrophage IL-10 improves colitis and limits colitis-associated colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic life-long inflammatory disease affecting almost 2 million Americans. Although new biologic therapies have been developed, the standard medical treatment fails to selectively control the dysregulated immune pathways involved in chronic colonic inflammation. Further, IBD patients with uncontrolled colonic inflammation are at a higher risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Intestinal microbes can impact many immune functions, and here we asked if they could be used to improve intestinal inflammation. By utilizing an intestinal adherent &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that we find increases IL-10 producing macrophages, we were able to limit intestinal inflammation and restrict tumor formation. Macrophage IL-10 along with IL-10 signaling to the intestinal epithelium were required for protection in both inflammation and tumor development. Our work highlights that administration of immune modulating microbes can improve intestinal outcomes by altering tissue inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long noncoding RNA LINC00239 inhibits ferroptosis in colorectal cancer by binding to Keap1 to stabilize Nrf2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36038548/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis, a novel regulated cell death induced by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, plays an important role in tumor development and drug resistance. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with various types of cancer. However, the precise roles of many lncRNAs in tumorigenesis remain elusive. Here we explored the transcriptomic profiles of lncRNAs in primary CRC tissues and corresponding paired adjacent non-tumor tissues by RNA-seq and found that LINC00239 was significantly overexpressed in colorectal cancer tissues. Abnormally high expression of LINC00239 predicts poorer survival and prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Concurrently, we elucidated the role of LINC00239 as a tumor-promoting factor in CRC through in vitro functional studies and in vivo tumor xenograft models. Importantly, overexpression of LINC00239 decreased the anti-tumor activity of erastin and RSL3 by inhibiting ferroptosis. Collectively, these data suggest that LINC00239 plays a novel and indispensable role in ferroptosis by nucleotides 1-315 of LINC00239 to interact with the Kelch domain (Nrf2-binding site) of Keap1, inhibiting Nrf2 ubiquitination and increasing Nrf2 protein stability. Considering the recurrence and chemoresistance constitute the leading cause of death in colorectal cancer (CRC), ferroptosis induction may be a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC patients with low LINC00239 expression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cephalosporins-induced intestinal dysbiosis exacerbated pulmonary endothelial barrier disruption in streptococcus pneumoniae-infected mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36093187/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic abuse is growing more severe in clinic, and even short-term antibiotic treatment can cause long-term gut dysbiosis, which may promote the development and aggravation of diseases. Cephalosporins as the broad-spectrum antibiotics are widely used for prevention and treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in children. However, their potential consequences in health and disease have not been fully elaborated. In this study, the effects of cefaclor, cefdinir and cefixime on intestinal microbiota and lung injury were investigated in &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; (Spn)-infected mice. The results showed that the proportion of coccus and bacillus in intestinal microbiota were changed after oral administration with cefaclor, cefdinir and cefixime twice for 10 days, respectively. Compared with the Spn-infected group, the proportion of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; in intestine were significantly reduced, while Enterococcus and Candida was increased after cephalosporin treatment. Furthermore, 3 cephalosporins could obviously increase the number of total cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes in BALF as well as the serum levels of endotoxin, IL-2, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Mechanically, cephalosporins accelerated Spn-induced pulmonary barrier dysfunction via mediating the mRNA expressions of endothelial barrier-related proteins (Claudin 5, Occludin, and ZO-1) and inflammation-related proteins (TLR4, p38 and NF-κB). However, all of those consequences could be partly reversed by &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium bifidum&lt;/em&gt; treatment, which was closely related to the elevated acetate production, indicating the protective effects of probiotic against antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that oral administration with cephalosporins not only disrupted intestinal microecological homeostasis, but also increased the risk of Spn infection, resulting in severer respiratory inflammation and higher bacterial loads in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is a pathological process that occurs in numerous organs throughout the human body and is frequently associated with severe cellular damage and death. Puerarin is an isoflavone compound extracted from the root of Pueraria lobata and has pharmacological effects such as dilating cerebral vessels and anti-free radical generation in cerebral ischemic tissues. With the deepening of experimental research and clinical research on puerarin, it has been found that puerarin has a protective effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of the heart, brain, spinal cord, lung, intestine and other organs. In summary, puerarin has a vast range of pharmacological effects and significant protective effects, and it also has obvious advantages in the clinical protection of patients with organ IRI. With the deepening of experimental pharmacological research and clinical research, it is expected to be an effective drug for IRI treatment. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the protective effect of puerarin on I/R organ injury and its possible underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lentinan-functionalized selenium nanoparticles induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human colon carcinoma HCT-116 cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have gained extensive attention for their excellent biological activity and low toxicity. However, SeNPs are extremely liable to aggregate into non-bioactive or gray elemental selenium, which limits their application in the biomedicine field. This study aimed to prepare stable SeNPs by using lentinan (LNT) as a template and evaluate its anti-colon cancer activity. The average particle diameter of obtained lentinan-selenium nanoparticles (LNT-SeNPs) was approximately 59 nm and presented zero-valent, amorphous, and spherical structures. The monodisperse SeNPs were stabilized by LNT through hydrogen bonding interactions. LNT-SeNPs solution remained highly stable at 4°C for at least 8 weeks. The stability of LNT-SeNPs solution sharply decreased under high temperature and strong acidic conditions. LNT-SeNPs showed no obvious cytotoxic effect on normal cells (IEC-6) but significantly inhibited the proliferation of five colon cancer cells (HCT-116, HT-29, Caco-2, SW620, and CT26). Among them, LNT-SeNPs exhibited the highest sensitivity toward HCT-116 cells with an IC50 value of 7.65 μM. Also, LNT-SeNPs displayed better cancer cell selectivity than sodium selenite and selenomethionine. Moreover, LNT-SeNPs promoted apoptosis of HCT-116 cells through activating mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Meanwhile, LNT-SeNPs induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in HCT-116 cells via modulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins. The results of this study indicated that LNT-SeNPs possessed strong potential application in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanoparticles: Attractive tools to treat colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36028154/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite the notable advances achieved over the last few decades, CRC remains a hard-to-treat deadly disease in many patients. This is attributed mainly to chemo- and immuno-resistance, which frequently emerge soon after treatment with conventional therapeutics. Systemic treatments are also constrained by their many undesired and serious side effects. More recently, nanomedicine has emerged as an attractive modality that can overcome issues of therapeutic resistance, improper delivery, or suboptimal targeting of tumor cells. Many nanomaterials, having already been examined in pre-clinical and clinical studies, are now considered biocompatible and relatively safe. Indeed, around 50 nano-formulations have so far been approved as diagnostic and therapeutic agents in humans. Here, in this review, we describe a set of imperative nanoparticles (NPs) involved in diagnosing and treating CRC. In particular, we discuss the theragnostic roles of quantum dots, iron oxide NPs, Polylactide-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) NPs, dendrimer NPs, carbon nanotubes, liposomes, and gold NPs. We dissect the molecular and clinical evidence supporting the use of these NPs in CRC. We also highlight their implications in targeted drug delivery as well as their anti-tumorigenic properties and effects on the cardinal hallmarks of CRC. We conclude by highlighting the notion that nanomedicine is emerging as an attractive approach to address the unmet needs in managing several diseases, including CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CEP63 upregulates YAP1 to promote colorectal cancer progression through stabilizing RNA binding protein FXR1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35989368/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abnormal regulation of centrosome components can induce chromosome instability and tumorigenesis. Centrosomal protein 63 (CEP63) is a vital member for assembling centrosome. Yet, the involvement of CEP63 in cancer pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we identify CEP63 as an important mediator for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to facilitate regulation on their RNA targets in colorectal cancer (CRC). We demonstrate that CEP63 protein is upregulated in a large cohort of colorectal cancer tissues and predicts poor prognosis, and USP36 is identified for stabilizing CEP63 by enhancing its K48-dependent deubiquitination. CEP63 overexpression promotes the proliferation and tumor growth of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we find that CEP63 can promote cancer stem-like cell properties by enhancing YAP1 expression through binding with and inhibiting the K63-ubiquitylation degradation of RBP FXR1 in CRC cells. Importantly, we further verify that the KH domain of FXR1 is necessary for the interaction between CEP63 and FXR1. Moreover, microtube motor proteins can form a complex with CEP63 and FXR1 to mediate the regulation of FXR1 on RNA targets. Additionally, we also confirm that CEP63 can bind and regulate multiple RBPs. In conclusion, our findings unveil an unrecognized CEP63/RBPs/RNA axis that CEP63 may perform as an adapter facilitating the formation of RBPs complex to regulate RNA progression and discover the role of CEP63 involved in signal transduction and RNA regulation, providing potential therapeutic target for CRC patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transposon-activated POU5F1B promotes colorectal cancer growth and metastasis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) is an unmet medical need in absence of early diagnosis. Here, upon characterizing cancer-specific transposable element-driven transpochimeric gene transcripts (TcGTs) produced by this tumor in the SYSCOL cohort, we find that expression of the hominid-restricted retrogene POU5F1B through aberrant activation of a primate-specific endogenous retroviral promoter is a strong negative prognostic biomarker. Correlating this observation, we demonstrate that POU5F1B fosters the proliferation and metastatic potential of CRC cells. We further determine that POU5F1B, in spite of its phylogenetic relationship with the POU5F1/OCT4 transcription factor, is a membrane-enriched protein that associates with protein kinases and known targets or interactors as well as with cytoskeleton-related molecules, and induces intracellular signaling events and the release of trans-acting factors involved in cell growth and cell adhesion. As POU5F1B is an apparently non-essential gene only lowly expressed in normal tissues, and as POU5F1B-containing TcGTs are detected in other tumors besides CRC, our data provide interesting leads for the development of cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypoxia-induced lncRNA STEAP3-AS1 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote colorectal cancer progression by preventing m6A-mediated degradation of STEAP3 mRNA</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35986274/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35986274/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Hypoxia, a typical hallmark of solid tumors, exhibits an essential role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), in which the dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is frequently observed. However, the underlying mechanisms are not clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The TCGA database was analyzed to identify differential lncRNA expression involved in hypoxia-induced CRC progression. qRT-PCR was conducted to validate the upregulation of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; in CRC cell lines and tumor-bearing mouse and zebrafish models under hypoxia. ChIP-qRT-PCR was used to detect the transcriptional activation of STEAP3-AS1 mediated by HIF-1α. RNA-seq, fluorescent in situ hybridization, RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and immunoblot experiments were used to ascertain the involved mechanisms. Functional assays were performed in both in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the regulatory role of &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt;/STEAP3/Wnt/β-catenin axis in CRC proliferation and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Here, we identified a hypoxia-induced antisense lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; that was highly expressed in clinical CRC tissues and positively correlated with poor prognosis of CRC patients. Upregulation of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt;, which was induced by HIF-1α-mediated transcriptional activation, facilitated the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; interacted competitively with the YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2), a N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) reader, leading to the disassociation of YTHDF2 with &lt;em&gt;STEAP3&lt;/em&gt; mRNA. This effect protected &lt;em&gt;STEAP3&lt;/em&gt; mRNA from m6A-mediated degradation, enabling the high expression of STEAP3 protein and subsequent production of cellular ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). Increased Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels elevated Ser 9 phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and inhibited its kinase activity, thus releasing β-catenin for nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of Wnt signaling to support CRC progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Taken together, our study highlights the mechanisms of lncRNA &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt; in facilitating CRC progression involving the &lt;em&gt;STEAP3-AS1&lt;/em&gt;/STEAP3/Wnt/β-catenin axis, which may provide novel diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets to benefit CRC treatment. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1α transcriptionally upregulates the expression of lncRNA STEAP3-AS1, which interacts competitively with YTHDF2, thus upregulating mRNA stability of STEAP3 and consequent STEAP3 protein expression. The enhanced STEAP3 expression results in production of cellular ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), which induces the Ser 9 phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β, releasing β-catenin for nuclear translocation and contributing to subsequent activation of Wnt signaling to promote CRC progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dietary fructose improves intestinal cell survival and nutrient absorption</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fructose consumption is linked to the rising incidence of obesity and cancer, which are two of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally. Dietary fructose metabolism begins at the epithelium of the small intestine, where fructose is transported by glucose transporter type 5 (GLUT5; encoded by SLC2A5) and phosphorylated by ketohexokinase to form fructose 1-phosphate, which accumulates to high levels in the cell. Although this pathway has been implicated in obesity and tumour promotion, the exact mechanism that drives these pathologies in the intestine remains unclear. Here we show that dietary fructose improves the survival of intestinal cells and increases intestinal villus length in several mouse models. The increase in villus length expands the surface area of the gut and increases nutrient absorption and adiposity in mice that are fed a high-fat diet. In hypoxic intestinal cells, fructose 1-phosphate inhibits the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase to promote cell survival. Genetic ablation of ketohexokinase or stimulation of pyruvate kinase prevents villus elongation and abolishes the nutrient absorption and tumour growth that are induced by feeding mice with high-fructose corn syrup. The ability of fructose to promote cell survival through an allosteric metabolite thus provides additional insights into the excess adiposity generated by a Western diet, and a compelling explanation for the promotion of tumour growth by high-fructose corn syrup.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel long noncoding RNA SP100-AS1 induces radioresistance of colorectal cancer via sponging miR-622 and stabilizing ATG3</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35978049/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although radiotherapy is an essential modality in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), the incidence of radioresistance remains high clinically. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) reportedly play critical roles in CRC radioresistance by regulating genes or proteins at the transcriptional or post-translational levels. This study aimed to identify novel lncRNAs involved in radioresistance. We found that SP100-AS1 (lncRNA targeting antisense sequence of SP100 gene) was upregulated in radioresistant CRC patient tissues using RNA-seq analysis. Importantly, knockdown of SP100-AS1 significantly reduced radioresistance, cell proliferation, and tumor formation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analyses were used to identify the interacting proteins and microRNAs of SP100-AS1, respectively. Moreover, SP100-AS1 was found to interact with and stabilize ATG3 protein through the ubiquitination-dependent proteasome pathway. In addition, it could serve as a sponge for miR-622, which targeted ATG3 mRNA and affected autophagic activity. Thus, lncRNA SP100-AS1 could act as a radioresistance factor in CRC patients via RNA sponging and protein stabilizing mechanisms. In conclusion, the present study indicates that SP100-AS1/miR-622/ATG3 axis contributes to radioresistance and autophagic activity in CRC patients, suggesting it has huge prospects as a therapeutic target for improving CRC response to radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adipocyte-Derived Exosomal MTTP Suppresses Ferroptosis and Promotes Chemoresistance in Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35978266/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity is closely related to a poor prognosis in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), but the mechanisms remain unclear. Ferroptosis is a form of nonapoptotic cell death characterized by lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and iron dependency and is associated with the chemoresistance of tumors. Here, it is shown that adipose-derived exosomes reduce ferroptosis susceptibility in CRC, thus promoting chemoresistance to oxaliplatin. It is found that microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) expression is increased in the plasma exosomes of CRC patients with a high body fat ratio, serving as an inhibitor of ferroptosis and reducing sensitivity to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, the MTTP/proline-rich acidic protein 1 (PRAP1) complex inhibited zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 expression and upregulated glutathione peroxidase 4 and xCT, leading to a decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio and lipid ROS levels. Moreover, experiments are carried out in organoids, and a tumor implantation model is established in obese mice, demonstrating that the inhibition of MTTP increases the sensitivity to chemotherapy. The results reveal a novel intracellular signaling pathway mediated by adipose-derived exosomes and suggest that treatments targeting secreted MTTP might reverse oxaliplatin resistance in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion improves LPS-induced acute lung injury via gut-lung axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35981631/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute inflammatory disorder. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathology of ALI remain elusive. An increasing evidence suggests the role of the gut-microbiota axis in the pathology of lung injury. This study aimed to investigate whether antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion could affect ALI in mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; The effects of antibiotic cocktail (ABX) on ALI in the mice after intratracheally administration of LPS (5 mg/kg) were examined. Furthermore, 16s rRNA analysis and measurement of short-chain fatty acids in feces samples and metabolomics analysis of blood samples were performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; LPS significantly increased the interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of water-treated mice. Interestingly, an ABX significantly attenuated the LPS-induced increase in IL-6 in BALF and lung injury scores. Furthermore, ABX and/or LPS treatment markedly altered the α- and β-diversity of the gut microbiota. There were significant differences in the α- and β-diversity of the water + LPS group and ABX + LPS group. LEfSe analysis identified &lt;em&gt;Enterococusfaecalis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Clostriumtertium&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroidescaecimyris&lt;/em&gt; as potential microbial markers for ABX + LPS group. Untargeted metabolomics analysis identified several plasma metabolites responsible for discriminating water + LPS group from ABX + LPS group. There were correlations between the relative abundance of the microbiome and plasma metabolites. Integrative network analysis showed correlations between IL-6 levels in BALF and several gut microbes (or plasma metabolites).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; These data suggest that ABX-induced microbiome depletion could protect against LPS-induced ALI via the gut-microbiota-lung axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SHMT2-mediated mitochondrial serine metabolism drives 5-FU resistance by fueling nucleotide biosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35977477/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serine metabolism is a key driver of 5-FU acquired resistance in CRC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affecting serine availability impairs DNA damage response in 5-FU-resistant cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitochondrial compartmentalization of serine metabolism sustains 5-FU resistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting mitochondrial serine metabolism is effective in overcoming 5-FU resistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a key component of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC). 5-FU efficacy is established by intracellular levels of folate cofactors and DNA damage repair strategies. However, drug resistance still represents a major challenge. Here, we report that alterations in serine metabolism affect 5-FU sensitivity in in vitro and in vivo CRC models. In particular, 5-FU-resistant CRC cells display a strong serine dependency achieved either by upregulating endogenous serine synthesis or increasing exogenous serine uptake. Importantly, regardless of the serine feeder strategy, serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2)-driven compartmentalization of one-carbon metabolism inside the mitochondria represents a specific adaptation of resistant cells to support purine biosynthesis and potentiate DNA damage response. Interfering with serine availability or affecting its mitochondrial metabolism revert 5-FU resistance. These data disclose a relevant mechanism of mitochondrial serine use supporting 5-FU resistance in CRC and provide perspectives for therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chlorogenic Acid Prevents Hyperuricemia Nephropathy via Regulating TMAO-Related Gut Microbes and Inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperuricemia is an independent hazard factor of renal injury and can induce renal fibrosis, promoting the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to explore the probability of chlorogenic acid (CGA) as a potential substance for preventing hyperuricemia nephropathy (HN). Pretreatment with CGA downregulated SUA, BUN, and CR levels, relieved oxidative stress and inflammatory response, alleviated kidney fibrosis, and contributed to the prevention of HN. In the gut microbiota, &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Faecalibaculum&lt;/em&gt; related to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) synthesis were significantly increased in HN rats. In addition, it showed a significant increase in serum TMAO content in HN rats. However, CGA regulated the cascade response of the microbiota-TMAO signaling to reverse the increase of serum TMAO. CGA also decreased the protein expression of protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by reducing the production of TMAO. CGA delayed kidney fibrosis in HN rats as evidenced by regulating the cascade response of the microbiota-TMAO-PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In summary, CGA can be an excellent candidate for HN prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrated metagenomic and metabolomic analysis reveals distinct gut-microbiome-derived phenotypes in early-onset colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35953094/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC) is steadily increasing. Here, we aimed to characterise the interactions between gut microbiome, metabolites and microbial enzymes in EO-CRC patients and evaluate their potential as non-invasive biomarkers for EO-CRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design:&lt;/em&gt; We performed metagenomic and metabolomic analyses, identified multiomics markers and constructed CRC classifiers for the discovery cohort with 130 late-onset CRC (LO-CRC), 114 EO-CRC subjects and age-matched healthy controls (97 LO-Control and 100 EO-Control). An independent cohort of 38 LO-CRC, 24 EO-CRC, 22 LO-Controls and 24 EO-Controls was analysed to validate the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with controls, reduced alpha-diversity was apparent in both, LO-CRC and EO-CRC subjects. Although common variations existed, integrative analyses identified distinct microbiome-metabolome associations in LO-CRC and EO-CRC. &lt;em&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; enrichment and short-chain fatty acid depletion, including reduced microbial GABA biosynthesis and a shift in acetate/acetaldehyde metabolism towards acetyl-CoA production characterises LO-CRC. In comparison, multiomics signatures of EO-CRC tended to be associated with enriched &lt;em&gt;Flavonifractor plauti&lt;/em&gt; and increased tryptophan, bile acid and choline metabolism. Notably, elevated red meat intake-related species, choline metabolites and KEGG orthology (KO) pldB and cbh gene axis may be potential tumour stimulators in EO-CRC. The predictive model based on metagenomic, metabolomic and KO gene markers achieved a powerful classification performance for distinguishing EO-CRC from controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our large-sample multiomics data suggest that altered microbiome-metabolome interplay helps explain the pathogenesis of EO-CRC and LO-CRC. The potential of microbiome-derived biomarkers as promising non-invasive tools could be used for the accurate detection and distinction of individuals with EO-CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disruption of the circadian clock drives Apc loss of heterozygosity to accelerate colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alarming rise in young onset colorectal cancer (CRC) has been reported; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains undefined. Suspected risk factors of young onset CRC include environmental aspects, such as lifestyle and dietary factors, which are known to affect the circadian clock. We find that both genetic disruption and environmental disruption of the circadian clock accelerate &lt;em&gt;Apc&lt;/em&gt;-driven CRC pathogenesis in vivo. Using an intestinal organoid model, we demonstrate that clock disruption promotes transformation by driving &lt;em&gt;Apc&lt;/em&gt; loss of heterozygosity, which hyperactivates Wnt signaling. This up-regulates &lt;em&gt;c-Myc&lt;/em&gt;, a known Wnt target, which drives heightened glycolytic metabolism. Using patient-derived organoids, we show that circadian rhythms are lost in human tumors. Last, we identify that variance between core clock and Wnt pathway genes significantly predicts the survival of patients with CRC. Overall, our findings demonstrate a previously unidentified mechanistic link between clock disruption and CRC, which has important implications for young onset cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe influenza A virus infection leads to overwhelming inflammatory responses and cellular apoptosis, which causes lung injury and contributes to high mortality and morbidity. The gut microbiome altered in response to the infection might influence the disease progression and the treatment outcome. Cangma Huadu (CMHD) granules, an in-hospital preparation of traditional Chinese medicine, have been shown to be favorable in the clinical treatment of influenza. However, the effects and mechanisms of CMHD granules on severe influenza pneumonia and its mechanisms are not well-known. In this study, a lethal influenza A (H1N1) A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (PR8)-infected mice model was established, and the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) V3-V4 region sequencing of the intestinal microbiome was conducted. We revealed that the oral administration of CMHD granules protects mice against higher mortality, enhanced weight loss, overwhelmed interferon-γ concentration, lung viral titers, and severe lung pathological injury in PR8-infected mice. CMHD granules&amp;rsquo; administration downregulated the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and malondialdehyde, while it upregulated the levels of IL-10, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. Subsequently, it decreased the protein ratio of B-cell lymphoma-2/Bcl-2-associated X and the expression of cleaved caspase-3. The diversity and compositions of the gut microbes were altered profoundly after the administration of CMHD granules in PR8-infected mice. A higher abundance of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parasutterella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Faecalibaculum&lt;/em&gt; was observed in the CMHD group, and a higher abundance of &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/em&gt; was observed in the positive drug Ribavirin group. The linear discriminant analysis effect size also revealed a higher proportion of &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium_pseudolongum&lt;/em&gt; characterized in the CMHD group. These results demonstrated that CMHD granules are a promising strategy for managing severe influenza and attenuating severe lung damage via reducing viral titer, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress. The mechanisms are involved in repressed Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis and altered composition and diversity of the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular characterization of colorectal cancer related peritoneal metastatic disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant proportion of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop peritoneal metastases (PM) in the course of their disease. PMs are associated with a poor quality of life, significant morbidity and dismal disease outcome. To improve care for this patient group, a better understanding of the molecular characteristics of CRC-PM is required. Here we present a comprehensive molecular characterization of a cohort of 52 patients. This reveals that CRC-PM represent a distinct CRC molecular subtype, CMS4, but can be further divided in three separate categories, each presenting with unique features. We uncover that the CMS4-associated structural protein Moesin plays a key role in peritoneal dissemination. Finally, we define specific evolutionary features of CRC-PM which indicate that polyclonal metastatic seeding underlies these lesions. Together our results suggest that CRC-PM should be perceived as a distinct disease entity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metabolic balance in colorectal cancer is maintained by optimal Wnt signaling levels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35904277/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wnt pathways are important for the modulation of tissue homeostasis, and their deregulation is linked to cancer development. Canonical Wnt signaling is hyperactivated in many human colorectal cancers due to genetic alterations of the negative Wnt regulator APC. However, the expression levels of Wnt-dependent targets vary between tumors, and the mechanisms of carcinogenesis concomitant with this Wnt signaling dosage have not been understood. In this study, we integrate whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screens with large-scale multi-omic data to delineate functional subtypes of cancer. We engineer APC loss-of-function mutations and thereby hyperactivate Wnt signaling in cells with low endogenous Wnt activity and find that the resulting engineered cells have an unfavorable metabolic equilibrium compared with cells which naturally acquired Wnt hyperactivation. We show that the dosage level of oncogenic Wnt hyperactivation impacts the metabolic equilibrium and the mitochondrial phenotype of a given cell type in a context-dependent manner. These findings illustrate the impact of context-dependent genetic interactions on cellular phenotypes of a central cancer driver mutation and expand our understanding of quantitative modulation of oncogenic signaling in tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BPTF inhibition antagonizes colorectal cancer progression by transcriptionally inactivating Cdc25A</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35932692/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35932692/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPTF was aberrantly highly expressed in CRC and promoted CRC progression in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPTF promoted the transcription of Cdc25A by binding to −178/+107 region of the Cdc25A promoter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPTF itself was transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc in CRC cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPTF inactivity sensitized CRC cells to chemotherapeutics, c-Myc inhibitor and cell cycle inhibitor in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C-Myc/BPTF/Cdc25A signaling axis is expected to be cascade candidate biomarkers for CRC diagnosis and prognosis prediction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the largest subunit of the nuclear remodeling factor complex, Bromodomain PHD Finger Transcription Factor (BPTF) has been reported to be involved in tumorigenesis and development in several cancers. However, to date, its functions and related molecular mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) are still poorly defined and deserve to be revealed. In this study, we uncovered that, under the expression regulation of c-Myc, BPTF promoted CRC progression by targeting Cdc25A. BPTF was found to be highly expressed in CRC and promoted the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells through BPTF specific siRNAs, shRNAs or inhibitors. Based on RNA-seq, combined with DNA-pulldown, ChIP and luciferase reporter assay, we proved that, by binding to −178/+107 region within Cdc25A promoter, BPTF transcriptionally activated Cdc25A, thus accelerating the cell cycle process of CRC cells. Meanwhile, BPTF itself was found to be transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc. Moreover, BPTF knockdown or inactivation was verified to sensitize CRC cells to chemotherapeutics, 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) and Oxaliplatin (Oxa), c-Myc inhibitor and cell cycle inhibitor not just at the cellular level in vitro, but in subcutaneous xenografts or AOM/DSS-induced in situ models of CRC in mice, while Cdc25A overexpression partially reversed BPTF silencing-caused tumor growth inhibition. Clinically, BPTF, c-Myc and Cdc25A were highly expressed in CRC tissues simultaneously, the expression of any two of the three was positively correlated, and their expressions were highly relevant to tumor differentiation, TNM staging and poor prognosis of CRC patients. Thus, our study indicated that the targeted inhibition of BPTF alone, or together with chemotherapy and/or cell cycle-targeted therapy, might act as a promising new strategy for CRC treatment, while c-Myc/BPTF/Cdc25A signaling axis is expected to be developed as an associated set of candidate biomarkers for CRC diagnosis and prognosis prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long non-coding RNA EVADR induced by Fusobacterium nucleatum infection promotes colorectal cancer metastasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35858553/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highli&lt;/strong&gt;ghts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; infection is enriched in CRC tissues with metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; promotes CRC cell metastasis to the liver and lung in mouse models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVADR induced by &lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; increases CRC metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVADR interacts with YBX1 to enhance the translation of EMT-related factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt;) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) EVADR are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but their relationship with CRC metastasis and the mechanisms by which EVADR promotes CRC metastasis are poorly understood. Here, we report that &lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; promotes colorectal cancer cell metastasis to the liver and lung and that it can be detected in CRC-metastasis colonization in mouse models. Furthermore, &lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; upregulates the expression of EVADR, which can increase the metastatic ability of CRC cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, elevated EVADR serves as a modular scaffold for the Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) to directly enhance the translation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors, such as Snail, Slug, and Zeb1. These findings suggest that EVADR induced by &lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt; promotes colorectal cancer metastasis through YBX1-dependent translation. The EVADR-YBX1 axis may be useful for the prevention and treatment of patients with &lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt;-associated CRC metastas&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CXCR2 Is Essential for Radiation-Induced Intestinal Injury by Initiating Neutrophil Infiltration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35879949/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils, known as an important part of the immune system, are the most abundant leukocyte population in peripheral blood, but excessive recruitment will lead to tissue/organ injury. RNA sequencing showed that ionizing radiation significantly increased the expression of characteristic genes of neutrophils in intestinal tissues compared with liver and lung tissues. By clearing neutrophils with an anti-Ly6G antibody, we found that neutrophil infiltration is critical for irradiation-induced intestinal injury. CXCR2 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that mediates the migration of neutrophils by combining with its ligands. Compared with observations in liver and lung tissues, we found that CXCR2 and its ligands, including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL5, were all significantly upregulated in irradiated intestinal tissues. Further studies showed that SB225002, an inhibitor of CXCR2, could effectively inhibit the chemotaxis of neutrophils and tissue damage mediated by the CXCL-CXCR2 signalling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tankyrase-selective inhibitor STP1002 shows preclinical antitumour efficacy without on-target toxicity in the gastrointestinal tract</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35849876/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35849876/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Tankyrase inhibition stabilises AXINs and antagonises the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-mutated colorectal cancer (CRC), suggesting that tankyrase is a potential therapeutic target for APC-mutated CRC. However, clinical trials on reported tankyrase inhibitors have been severely limited by on-target toxicity in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Herein, we report a new tankyrase-selective inhibitor, STP1002, having preclinical antitumour efficacy without on-target toxicity in APC-mutated CRC models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; STP1002 was developed and characterised using in vitro and in vivo functional studies; its pharmacokinetics, antitumour efficacy and toxicity were evaluated in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; STP1002 showed potent, selective inhibition of tankyrase 1/2 but not of members of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2 (PARP1/2). STP1002 exerted antitumour activity by stabilising AXINs and antagonising the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in a subset of APC-mutated CRC cell lines but not in inhibitor-resistant cells and APC-wild-type CRC cell lines. STP1002 showed favourable pharmacokinetic profiles for oral administration once daily. STP1002 inhibited tumour growth of APC-mutated CRC xenograft animal models but not of APC-wild type models in a dose-dependent manner. The antitumour efficacy of STP1002 was confirmed using APC-mutated CRC patient-derived tumour xenograft models. STP1002 showed no significant on-target toxicity in the GI tract compared to G007-LK, which shows severe ileum toxicity in preclinical animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These results demonstrate that STP1002, a novel, orally active tankyrase inhibitor, shows preclinical antitumour efficacy without on-target toxicity in the GI tract. Our data provide a rationale for a clinical trial on STP1002 as a potential tankyrase-targeted drug in patients with APC-mutated CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Circulating Tumor DNA in Colorectal Cancer: Current and Evolving Practices</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exists a tremendous opportunity in identifying and determining the appropriate predictive and prognostic biomarker(s) for risk stratification of patients with colorectal cancers (CRCs). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising prognostic and possibly predictive biomarker in the personalized management of patients with CRCs. The disease is particularly suited to a liquid biopsy-based approach since there is a great deal of shedding of circulating tumor fragments (cells, DNA, methylation markers, etc). ctDNA has been shown to have several potential applications, including detecting minimal residual disease (MRD), monitoring for early recurrence, molecular profiling, and therapeutic response prediction. The utility of ctDNA has broadened from its initial use in the advanced/metastatic setting for molecular profiling and detection of acquired resistance mechanisms, toward identifying MRD, as well as early detection. Prospective studies such as CIRCULATE, COBRA, Dynamic II/III, and ACT3 are underway in the MRD setting to further understand how ctDNA may be used to inform clinical decision making using both tumor-informed and tumor-agnostic platforms. These prospective studies use ctDNA to guide management of patients with CRC and will be critical to help guide how and where ctDNA should or should not be used in clinical decision making. It is also important to understand that there are different types of ctDNA liquid biopsy platforms, each with advantages and disadvantages in different clinical indications. This review provides an overview of the current and evolving use of ctDNA in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;γδ T cells represent a substantial fraction of intestinal lymphocytes at homeostasis, but they also constitute a major lymphocyte population infiltrating colorectal cancers (CRCs); however, their temporal contribution to CRC development or progression remains unclear. Using human CRC samples and murine CRC models, we found that most γδ T cells in premalignant or nontumor colons exhibit cytotoxic markers, whereas tumor-infiltrating γδ T cells express a protumorigenic profile. These contrasting T cell profiles were associated with distinct T cell receptor (TCR)-Vγδ gene usage in both humans and mice. Longitudinal intersectional genetics and antibody-dependent strategies targeting murine γδ T cells enriched in the epithelium at steady state led to heightened tumor development, whereas targeting γδ subsets that accumulate during CRC resulted in reduced tumor growth. Our results uncover temporal pro- and antitumor roles for γδ T cell subsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human gut virome, which is often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;dark matter&amp;rdquo; of the gut microbiome, remains understudied. A better understanding of the composition and variations of the gut virome across populations is critical for exploring its impact on diseases and health. A series of advances in the characterization of human gut virome have unveiled high genetic diversity and various functional potentials of gut viruses. Here, we summarize the recently available human gut virome databases and discuss their features, procedures, and challenges with the intention to provide a reference to researchers to use while choosing a profiling database. We also propose a &amp;ldquo;best practice&amp;rdquo; for cataloging the viral population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the concept of the gut-lung axis reinforced in recent years, emerging evidence has shown that intestinal homeostasis is vital for lung health. Nevertheless, the impacts of lung homeostasis on intestinal tracts and their mechanism are rarely studied. Our results showed that papain-induced asthmatic mice exhibited apparent colonic injuries compared with controls, including increased intestinal permeability, neutrophil and Th17 infiltration in the colonic lamina propria. Moreover, the intranasal administration of papain aggravated such colonic injuries in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, as evidenced by increased occult blood scores, shortened colon length, and accumulated neutrophils. The level of IL-17A was also higher in the serum of asthmatic mice than wild-type mice. Interestingly, the pathologic scores, the proportion of Th17 cells, and neutrophil infiltration in the colon were markedly reduced after IL-17A blocking. Similarly, longer length, lower pathologic scores, and fewer neutrophils were also observed in the colon of IL-17-deficient asthmatic mice. More importantly, we demonstrated that severe gastrointestinal symptoms could accompany clinical asthmatics. The frequencies of Th17 cells and the mRNA expression of IL-17A in the peripheral blood of these patients were significantly enhanced. Besides, the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale scores positively correlated with the frequencies of Th17 in asthmatics. These findings enlighten that IL-17A aggravates asthma-induced intestinal immune injury by promoting neutrophil trafficking, which facilitates the exploration of new potential biomarkers to treat asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dopamine Signaling Promotes Tissue-Resident Memory Differentiation of CD8&#43; T Cells and Antitumor Immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35802647/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue-resident memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T (T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;) cells have been associated with robust protective antitumor immune responses and improved prognosis of patients with cancer. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that modulate either the production or activity of T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells could be effective for treating cancer. Using a high-throughput drug screen, we showed that the neurotransmitter dopamine drives differentiation of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells into CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells. In murine syngeneic tumor xenograft models and clinical human colon cancer samples, DRD5 served as the major functional dopamine receptor on CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and positively correlated with T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cell density. DRD5 deficiency led to a failure of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells to accumulate in tissues, resulting in impaired T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cell formation, reduced effector function, and uncontrolled disease progression. Moreover, dopamine treatment promoted the antitumor activity of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and suppressed colorectal cancer growth in immunocompentent mouse models, and ex vivo preconditioning with dopamine enhanced the in vivo efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. Finally, in a patient with colorectal cancer cohort, dopamine expression was positively associated with patient survival and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell infiltration. These findings suggest that dopaminergic immunoregulation plays an important role in the differentiation of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells into CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells and thereby modulates T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;-elicited antitumor immunity in colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of an immunostimulatory function of dopamine signaling by promoting tissue-resident memory T-cell differentiation and sustaining T-cell effector functions reveals potential therapeutic strategies and prognostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HOTAIR/miR-1277-5p/ZEB1 axis mediates hypoxia-induced oxaliplatin resistance via regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35798695/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypoxic microenvironment contributes to the chemoresistance of many malignant tumors including colorectal cancer (CRC). Accumulating studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in chemotherapy resistance. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of lncRNAs in hypoxia-mediated resistance in CRC and its potential mechanism. Here, we discovered that hypoxia-induced oxaliplatin resistance and HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) expression was increased in hypoxia-treated CRC cell lines and CRC tumors. Knockdown of HOTAIR by siRNA reduced the viability and proliferation of CRC cells treated with oxaliplatin and reversed hypoxia-induced resistance. Mechanically, we found that HOTAIR modulates zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) expression by negative regulations of miR-1277-5p. When miR-1277-5p was silenced, knockdown of HOTAIR was unable to reduce the oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells. In mouse models of CRC, HOTAIR knockdown markedly inhibited the tumor growth when treated with oxaliplatin. Thus, HOTAIR/miR-1277-5p/ZEB1 axis appears a promising therapeutic target for improving the oxaliplatin efficacy in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MUC1-mediated Macrophage Activation Promotes Colitis-associated Colorectal Cancer via Activating the Interleukin-6/ Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 Axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35809803/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; MUC1 is abnormally expressed in colorectal cancer, including colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), but its role in tumorigenesis is unclear. This study investigated MUC1&amp;rsquo;s effects in murine models of colitis and CAC and elucidated mechanisms of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Colitis and CAC were induced in mice by exposure to dextran sodium sulfate or azoxymethane plus dextran sodium sulphate. Clinical parameters, immune cell infiltration, and tumor development were monitored throughout disease progression. Experiments in knockout mice and bone marrow chimeras were combined with an exploration of immune cell abundance and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Deficiency of Muc1 suppressed inflammation, inhibited tumor progression, increased abundance of CD8+ T lymphocytes, and reduced abundance of macrophages in colon tumors. Bone marrow chimeras showed promotion of CAC was primarily mediated by Muc1-expressing hematopoietic cells, and that MUC1 promoted a pro-tumoral immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype within tumors. Mechanistic studies revealed that Muc1 deficiency remarkably reduced interleukin-6 levels in the colonic tissues and tumors that was mainly produced by infiltrating macrophages at day 21, 42, and 85. In bone marrow-derived macrophages, MUC1 promoted responsiveness to chemoattractant and promoted activation into a phenotype with high Il6 and Ido1 expression, secreting factors which inhibited CD8+ T cell proliferation. MUC1 potently drives macrophages to produce interleukin-6, which in turn drives a pro-tumorigenic activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in colon epithelial tumor and stromal cells, ultimately increasing the occurrence and development of CAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings provide cellular and molecular mechanisms for the pro-tumorigenic functions of MUC1 in the inflamed colon. Therapeutic strategies to inhibit MUC1 signal transduction warrant consideration for the prevention or therapy of CAC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oral administration of asparagine and 3-indolepropionic acid prolongs survival time of rats with traumatic colon injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35791006/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Traumatic colon injury (TCI) is a common disease during wartime. Prolongation of posttraumatic survival time is an effective approach to patient outcome improvement. However, there is a lack of basic research in this field. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying TCI progression and to develop novel regimens to buy time for TCI patients on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 669 Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Surgical colon incision was performed to generate the TCI rat model. The landscape of colon microbiota compositions was depicted using 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolites in the intestinal contents were detected by metabolomics profiling. The signaling transduction in the intestinal epithelium was investigated using antibody microarrays and Western blotting. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to measure the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in intestines and plasma for the detection of inflammatory responses. Diamine oxidase, D-lactate and endotoxin in plasma and protein expression of zonula occludens 1 and occludin were selected as the indicators of intestinal barrier permeability. To investigate alterations of microbiota symbiosis, the relative abundances of specific bacterial genera were detected using quantitative real-time PCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; As a type of lethal injury, TCI induced acute disruption of intestinal homeostasis, characterized by inflammatory responses, intestinal barrier hyperpermeability and microbiota dysbiosis (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Significant alterations in bacterial metabolic patterns were detected with decreases in many metabolites. After a series of screenings, we found that oral administration of asparagine (Asn) and 3-indolepropionic acid (IPA) effectively prolonged posttraumatic survival time (Asn plus IPA vs. Vehicle: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.105, 95% CI 0.031-0.356, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0003) and restored intestinal homeostasis in TCI rats (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Mechanistically, this combinational strategy protected the rats against TCI through synergistic activation of Akt signaling in the intestinal epithelium (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Abrupt dysregulation of intestinal homeostasis plays a critical role in the progression toward TCI-induced death. Oral administration of Asn plus IPA may serve as an effective regimen to restore intestinal functions and prolong the posttraumatic survival time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 0111 Protects Against Influenza Virus by Modulating Intestinal Microbial-Mediated Immune Responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35847111/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations of traditional influenza vaccines concerning novel mutant strains. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop preventive means for antigen-unrelated types of influenza viruses. Recent studies have shown that probiotics can modulate the immune system and reduce the severity of viral infections. In this study, we investigated the potential of &lt;em&gt;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 against influenza virus H9N2. Challenge experiments showed that &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 pretreatments could effectively improve mice&amp;rsquo;s survival rate and weight loss and reduce the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) along with the degree of lung and intestinal injury. FMT experiment demonstrates that the protective effect produced by &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 is associated with gut microorganisms. In addition, 16S high-throughput sequencing of the mouse intestinal microbiota showed that &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 remodeled the intestinal microbiota after H9N2 infection and maintained the gut microbiota balance. In a mouse model, the oral administration of &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 increased IFN-β expression in the serum and BALF. At the same time, the transcript levels of IFN-β and related ISGs in the intestine and lungs of mice were also increased. In addition, the activation and polarization of T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and the spleen were detected by flow cytometry, and the results showed that &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 modulated cytokines in T cells and increased IgA expression in B cells in the MLNs and spleen. Thus, &lt;em&gt;L. plantarum&lt;/em&gt; 0111 may improve gut microbiota-mediated immune responses and thus, resist infection by the influenza virus, and it could be used as an effective preventive measure against the influenza virus.

      <title>Terbinafine prevents colorectal cancer growth by inducing dNTP starvation and reducing immune suppression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35765243/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing evidence indicates that gut fungal dysbiosis might play a key role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We sought to explore whether reversing the fungal dysbiosis by terbinafine, an approved antifungal drug, might inhibit the development of CRC. A population-based study from Sweden identified a total of 185 patients who received terbinafine after their CRC diagnosis and found that they had a decreased risk of death (hazard ratio = 0.50) and metastasis (hazard ratio = 0.44) compared with patients without terbinafine administration. In multiple mouse models of CRC, administration of terbinafine decreased the fungal load, the fungus-induced myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) expansion, and the tumor burden. Fecal microbiota transplantation from mice without terbinafine treatment reversed MDSC infiltration and partially restored tumor proliferation. Mechanistically, terbinafine directly impaired tumor cell proliferation by reducing the ratio of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) to reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), suppressing the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), resulting in nucleotide synthesis disruption, deoxyribonucleotide (dNTP) starvation, and cell-cycle arrest. Collectively, terbinafine can inhibit CRC by reversing fungal dysbiosis, suppressing tumor cell proliferation, inhibiting fungus-induced MDSC infiltration, and restoring antitumor immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Based on lapatinib innovative near-infrared fluorescent probes targeting HER1/HER2 for in vivo tumors imaging</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35779413/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human epidermal growth factor receptors HER1 and HER2, overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, are key regulators of tumor cells proliferation, invasion and survival. Many antibody- or peptide-based fluorescent probes targeted to HER1/HER2 are under active clinical evaluation. However, the effective small-molecule near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes are still lacking. Herein, with the strategy of drug repurposing, we developed a series of HER1/HER2-targeted probes YQ-H (01-07) composed of fluorophore (a cyanine dye, MPA), linker unit and targeted unit (lapatinib, LAP). The synthesized probes were evaluated in vitro and in vivo tumor specificity/affinity. Specially, the probe YQ-H-06 exhibited optimal pharmacokinetic property and tumor/normal tissue ratio (T/N) in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, we evaluated the targeting capability of YQ-H-06 in orthotopic colorectal cancer and orthotopic hepatic carcinoma mice. It was indicated that YQ-H-06 had the characteristic of great biosafety, favorable pH and chemical stability, as well as provided excellent tumor contrast in orthotopic murine tumor models. The NIR fluorescent probe YQ-H-06 will shed light on tumor detection and fluorescence-guided surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Garcinone C Suppresses Tumorsphere Formation and Invasiveness by Hedgehog/Gli1 Signaling in Colorectal Cancer Stem-like Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35749593/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperactivation of hedgehog signaling occurs in colorectal cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), a rare subpopulation, potentially involved in metastasis, chemotherapy resistance, and cancer relapse. Garcinone C, a xanthone isolated from mangosteen (&lt;em&gt;Garcinia mangostana&lt;/em&gt;), suppresses colorectal cancer &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; by inhibiting Gli1-dependent noncanonical hedgehog signaling. Herein, we investigated the effect of garcinone C on cancer stemness and invasiveness in colorectal cancer; Gli1 was noted as pivotal in maintaining stemness and invasiveness in HCT116 and HT29 CSCs. Garcinone C inhibited the proliferation and self-renewal of HCT116 and HT29 CSCs. Colon cancer stemness markers such as CD44, CD133, ALDH1, and Nanog were significantly decreased by garcinone C. Computational studies showed that garcinone C showed a high affinity with the Gli1 protein ZF domain by forming hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues of ASP244, ARG223, and ASP216. Besides, MG132 blocked the effects of garcinone C on Gli1. Thus, garcinone C suppressed colorectal CSCs by binding to Gli1 and enhancing its degradation. MMP2 and MMP9 levels, invasive-related markers, were increased in HCT116 CSCs but decreased by garcinone C. E-cadherin level was reduced in HCT116 CSCs, while the presence of garcinone C was restored. Garcinone C inhibited the proliferation and invasiveness of colorectal CSCs by targeting Gli1-dependent Hh signaling. Garcinone C may be a potent natural agent against colorectal cancer relapse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>circEXOC6B interacting with RRAGB, an mTORC1 activator, inhibits the progression of colorectal cancer by antagonizing the HIF1A-RRAGB-mTORC1 positive feedback loop</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35739524/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In recent years, an increasing number of studies have indicated that circular RNA plays crucial roles in regulating tumor development and chemoresistance. Using two high-throughput RNA sequence datasets, we previously found that circEXOC6B was downregulated in colon cancer. However, its role and mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) remained unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Real-time quantitative PCR was used to examine the expression of circEXOC6B in CRC tissues. In vivo and in vitro functional experiments were performed to determine the suppressor role of circEXOC6B in CRC progression. RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence were applied to investigate the possible mechanisms connecting circEXOC6B to CRC growth and 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase assay, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were used to explore the mechanisms underlying the HIF1A regulation of RRAGB transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; circEXOC6B was downregulated in CRC tissues, and its lower expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients. Functional experiments showed that circEXOC6B inhibited growth and increased the 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circEXOC6B inhibited the heterodimer formation of RRAGB by binding to it, thereby suppressing the mTORC1 pathway and HIF1A level. In addition, HIF1A upregulated the transcription of RRAGB by binding to its promoter region. Altogether, the results demonstrated that a HIF1A-RRAGB-mTORC1 positive feedback loop drives tumor progression in CRC, which could be interrupted by circEXOC6B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; circEXOC6B inhibits the progression of CRC and enhances the chemosensitivity of CRC cells to 5-fluorouracil by antagonizing the HIF1A-RRAGB-mTORC1 positive feedback loop. circEXOC6B is a possible therapeutic target for CRC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The gut-lung axis in severe acute Pancreatitis-associated lung injury: The protection by the gut microbiota through short-chain fatty acids</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of gut microbiota in regulating the intestinal homeostasis, as well as the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury (PALI) is widely recognized. The bioactive functions of metabolites with small molecule weight and the detail molecular mechanisms of PALI mediated by &amp;ldquo;gut-lung axis&amp;rdquo; have gradually raised the attentions of researchers. Several studies have proved that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbiome play crucial roles and varied activities in the process of PALI. However, relevant reviews reporting SCFAs in the involvement of PALI is lacking. In this review, we firstly introduced the synthetic and metabolic pathways of SCFAs, as well as the transport and signal transduction routes in brief. Afterwards, we focused on the possible mechanisms and clues of SCFAs to participate in the fight against PALI which referred to the inhibition of pathogen proliferation, anti-inflammatory effects, enhancement of intestinal barrier functions, and the maintenance and regulation of immune homeostasis via pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In addition, the latest reported pathological and physiological mechanisms of the gut-lung axis involved in PALI were reviewed. Finally, we summarized the potential therapeutic interventions of PALI by targeting SCFAs, including dietary fiber supplementation, direct supplementation of SCFAs/prebiotics/probiotics, and drugs administration, which is expected to provide new sights for clinical use in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors is mediated by BRAF splicing variants in BRAF V600E mutation-positive colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35724767/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BRAF inhibitor resistant CRC-NEC cell line was established from patient derived cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BRAF splicing variants were found in the BRAF inhibitor resistant CRC-NEC cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MEK or ERK inhibitor can overcome the BRAF splicing variant mediated resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), a poorly differentiated subtype of neuroendocrine neoplasms, are aggressive and have a poor prognosis. Colorectal neuroendocrine carcinomas (CRC-NECs) are observed in about 0.6% of all patients with CRC. Interestingly, patients with CRC-NECs show higher frequencies of BRAF mutation than typical CRC. BRAF V600E mutation-positive CRC-NECs were shown to be sensitive to BRAF inhibitors and now are treated by BRAF inhibitors. Similar to the other BRAF V600E mutated cancers, resistances against BRAF inhibitors have been observed, but the resistance mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we established BRAF V600E mutated CRC-NEC cell line directly from surgical specimens and experimentally obtained BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib resistant cell lines. The resistant cells are revealed to express at least three types of BRAF splicing variants harboring V600E-mutation, and contribute to RAF/MEK/ERK pathway activation. In these cells, MEK and ERK inhibitors but not dabrafenib significantly suppressed cell growth and survival. Thus, in BRAF V600E mutation-positive CRC-NECs, BRAF splicing variants activate the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and contribute to acquire BRAF inhibitor resistance. Hence, MEK or ERK are potential therapeutic targets to overcome BRAF resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dual inhibition of TGFβ signaling and CSF1/CSF1R reprograms tumor-infiltrating macrophages and improves response to chemotherapy via suppressing PD-L1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TGF promotes resistance to chemotherapy in CRC via PD-L1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemotherapy-treated cancer cells secrete CSF1 to recruit M2-TAMs for TGF production within tumor microenvironment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dual inhibition on CSF1R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; M2-TAMs recruitment and TGF signaling increases the response to chemotherapy in CRC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TGFβ contributes to chemoresistance in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) via diverse immune-microenvironment mechanisms. Here, we found that cancer cell autonomous TGFβ directly triggered tumor programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) upregulation, resulting in resistance to chemotherapy. Inhibition of tumor PD-L1 expression sensitized cancer cells to chemotherapy, reduced lung metastasis and increased the influx of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. However, chemorefractory cancer cell-derived CSF1 recruited TAMs for TGFβ-mediated PD-L1 upregulation via a vicious cycle. High infiltration of macrophages was clinically correlated with the status of tumor PD-L1 after chemotherapy treatment in CRC patients. We found that depletion of immunosuppressive CSF1R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; TAM infiltration and blockade of the TGFβ receptor resulted in an increased influx of cytotoxic CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T and effector memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells, a reduction in regulatory T cells, and a synergistic inhibition of tumor growth when combined with chemotherapy. These findings show that CSF1R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; TAMs and TGFβ are the dominant components that regulate PD-L1 expression within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, providing a therapeutic strategy for advanced CRC patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dynamic Chromatin States Coupling with Key Transcription Factors in Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35712778/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is one of the critical risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanisms for transition from colitis to CRC remain elusive. Recently, epigenetic changes have emerged as important regulatory factors for colitis-associated cancer. Here, a systematic epigenomic study of histone modifications is performed, including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, in an AOM-DSS-induced CRC mouse model. In combination with transcriptomic data, the authors generate a dataset of 105 deep sequencing files and illustrate the dynamic landscape of chromatin states at five time points during inflammation-cancer transition. Functional gene clusters are identified based on dynamic transcriptomic and epigenomic information, and key signaling pathways in the process are illustrated. This study&amp;rsquo;s results reveal that enhancer state regions play important roles during inflammation-cancer transition. It predicts novel transcription factors based on enhancer information, and experimentally proves OTX2 as a critical tumor suppressive transcription factor. Taken together, this study provides comprehensive epigenomic data and reveals novel molecular mechanisms for colitis-associated cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut dysbiosis promotes prostate cancer progression and docetaxel resistance via activating NF-κB-IL6-STAT3 axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35710492/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The gut microbiota is reportedly involved in the progression and chemoresistance of various human malignancies. However, the underlying mechanisms behind how it exerts some effect on prostate cancer, as an extra-intestinal tumor, in a contact-independent way remain elusive and deserve exploration. Antibiotic exposure, one of the various factors affecting the gut microbiota community and capable of causing gut dysbiosis, is associated with multiple disorders. This study aims to preliminarily clarify the link between gut dysbiosis and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; First, we discovered that perturbing the gut microbiota by consuming broad-spectrum antibiotics in water promoted the growth of subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors in mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation could transmit the effect of antibiotic exposure on tumor growth. Then, 16S rRNA sequencing for mouse feces indicated that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher after antibiotic exposure. Meanwhile, intratumoral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profoundly increased under the elevation of gut permeability. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that the NF-κB-IL6-STAT3 axis activated by intratumoral LPS facilitated prostate cancer proliferation and docetaxel chemoresistance. Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing of patients&amp;rsquo; fecal samples revealed that Proteobacteria was enriched in patients with metastatic prostate cancer and was positively correlated with plasma IL6 level, regional lymph node metastasis status, and distant metastasis status. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria had better performance than the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in predicting the probability of distant metastasis in prostate cancer (area under the ROC curve, 0.860; p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, this research demonstrated that gut dysbiosis, characterized by the enrichment of Proteobacteria due to antibiotic exposure, resulted in the elevation of gut permeability and intratumoral LPS, promoting the development of prostate cancer via the NF-κB-IL6-STAT3 axis in mice. Considering findings from human patients, Proteobacteria might act as an intestinal biomarker for progressive prostate cancer. Video Abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uptake of Functional Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles in 3D Gut Cell Models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35712760/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2 nm) easily penetrate the membranes of intestinal murine epithelial cells (MODE-K) and colorectal cancer cells (CT-26). They are also taken up by 3D spheroids (400 µm) of these cell types and primary gut organoids (500 µm). In contrast, dissolved dyes are not taken up by any of these cells or 3D structures. The distribution of fluorescent ultrasmall gold nanoparticles inside cells, spheroids, and gut organoids is examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Nanoparticles conjugated with the cytostatic drug doxorubicin and a fluorescent dye exhibit significantly greater cytotoxicity toward CT-26 tumor spheroids than equally concentrated dissolved doxorubicin, probably because they enter the interior of a spheroid much more easily than dissolved doxorubicin. Comprehensive analyses show that the cellular uptake of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles occurs by different endocytosis pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal Microbiota - An Unmissable Bridge to Severe Acute Pancreatitis-Associated Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35774796/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), one of the most serious abdominal emergencies in general surgery, is characterized by acute and rapid onset as well as high mortality, which often leads to multiple organ failure (MOF). Acute lung injury (ALI), the earliest accompanied organ dysfunction, is the most common cause of death in patients following the SAP onset. The exact pathogenesis of ALI during SAP, however, remains unclear. In recent years, advances in the microbiota-gut-lung axis have led to a better understanding of SAP-associated lung injury (PALI). In addition, the bidirectional communications between intestinal microbes and the lung are becoming more apparent. This paper aims to review the mechanisms of an imbalanced intestinal microbiota contributing to the development of PALI, which is mediated by the disruption of physical, chemical, and immune barriers in the intestine, promotes bacterial translocation, and results in the activation of abnormal immune responses in severe pancreatitis. The pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) mediated immunol mechanisms in the occurrence of PALI via binding with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) through the microbiota-gut-lung axis are focused in this study. Moreover, the potential therapeutic strategies for alleviating PALI by regulating the composition or the function of the intestinal microbiota are discussed in this review. The aim of this study is to provide new ideas and therapeutic tools for PALI patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ATR-mediated CD47 and PD-L1 up-regulation restricts radiotherapy-induced immune priming and abscopal responses in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35687697/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiotherapy (RT) of colorectal cancer (CRC) can prime adaptive immunity against tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-expressing CRC cells systemically. However, abscopal tumor remissions are extremely rare, and the postirradiation immune escape mechanisms in CRC remain elusive. Here, we found that irradiated CRC cells used ATR-mediated DNA repair signaling pathway to up-regulate both CD47 and PD-L1, which through engagement of SIRPα and PD-1, respectively, prevented phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells and thereby limited TAA cross-presentation and innate immune activation. This postirradiation CD47 and PD-L1 up-regulation was observed across various human solid tumor cells. Concordantly, rectal cancer patients with poor responses to neoadjuvant RT exhibited significantly elevated postirradiation CD47 levels. The combination of RT, anti-SIRPα, and anti-PD-1 reversed adaptive immune resistance and drove efficient TAA cross-presentation, resulting in robust TAA-specific CD8 T cell priming, functional activation of T effectors, and increased T cell clonality and clonal diversity. We observed significantly higher complete response rates to RT/anti-SIRPα/anti-PD-1 in both irradiated and abscopal tumors and prolonged survival in three distinct murine CRC models, including a cecal orthotopic model. The efficacy of triple combination therapy was STING dependent as knockout animals lost most benefit of adding anti-SIRPα and anti-PD-1 to RT. Despite activation across the myeloid stroma, the enhanced dendritic cell function accounts for most improvements in CD8 T cell priming. These data suggest ATR-mediated CD47 and PD-L1 up-regulation as a key mechanism restraining radiation-induced immune priming. RT combined with SIRPα and PD-1 blockade promotes robust antitumor immune priming, leading to systemic tumor regressions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Combination treatment with 17β-estradiol and anti-PD-L1 suppresses MC38 tumor growth by reducing PD-L1 expression and enhancing M1 macrophage population in MC38 colon tumor model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35690286/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35690286/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17β-estradiol is known to have a protective effect in colon cancer development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sex differences exist in MC38 tumor growth, PD-L1 expression, and cell populations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17β-estradiol treatment before MC38 injection reduced high cell types in males.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synergistic effect of 17β-estradiol on anti-tumorigenic effect of anti-PD-L1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17β-estradiol (E2) is known to have a protective effect in colorectal cancer (CRC); thus, E2 may be effective for cancer immunotherapy in CRC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of combination therapy with E2 and anti-programmed cell death receptor-1 ligand (PD-L1) antibodies, and the effects of sex and estrogen on colon tumor growth, PD-L1 expression, and tumor-associated cell populations in an MC38 colon tumor model. Male mice showed increased MC38 colon tumor growth and PD-L1 expression in tumor sections as well as higher proportion of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CD45-CD31-CD140a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), PD-L1-expressing tumor cells (CD45-CD274&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD274&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to female mice. E2 treatment prior to MC38 injection significantly reduced these phenomena in male mice. Furthermore, co-treatment with E2 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies significantly inhibited MC38 tumor growth and reduced PD-L1-expressing cells in male mice compared to treatment with either E2 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies alone. Combination treatment with E2 and anti-PD-L1 decreased TAM population (CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in the tumor mass while increasing M1 TMAs (CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD86&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). These results suggest that estrogen inhibits MC38 tumor growth by downregulating PD-L1 expression and regulating tumor-associated cell populations. Furthermore, estrogen boosted the effect of anti-PD-L1 antibody in the MC38 tumor model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;/em&gt;-p.G659fs mutation occurs frequently in colorectal cancer, but its function remains poorly understood and there are no specific therapies directed against this alteration. In this study, we find that &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;/em&gt;-p.G659fs promotes cell growth independent of Wnt signaling. We perform a drug repurposing library screen and discover that cells with &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;/em&gt;-p.G659 mutations are selectively killed by inhibition of PI3K signaling. PI3K/mTOR inhibitors yield promising antitumor activity in &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;sup&gt;659mut&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; isogenic cell lines and xenograft models, as well as in patient-derived organoids harboring &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;/em&gt;-p.G659fs mutations. We find that &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;sup&gt;659mut&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; binds p85 leading to increased PI3K signaling through p85 ubiquitination and degradation. Additionally, RNA-sequencing of &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;sup&gt;659mut&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; isogenic cells reveals decreased interferon response gene expression, that is reversed by PI3K/mTOR inhibition, suggesting that &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;sup&gt;659mut&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; may alter tumor immunity. Our findings suggest a therapeutic application for PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in treating &lt;em&gt;RNF43&lt;/em&gt;-p.G659fs mutant cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Association of Physician Adenoma Detection Rates With Postcolonoscopy Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35670788/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35670788/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Importance:&lt;/em&gt; Although colonoscopy is frequently performed in the United States, there is limited evidence to support threshold values for physician adenoma detection rate as a quality metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To evaluate the association between physician adenoma detection rate values and risks of postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer and related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design, setting, and participants:&lt;/em&gt; Retrospective cohort study in 3 large integrated health care systems (Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and Kaiser Permanente Washington) with 43 endoscopy centers, 383 eligible physicians, and 735 396 patients aged 50 to 75 years who received a colonoscopy that did not detect cancer (negative colonoscopy) between January 2011 and June 2017, with patient follow-up through December 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exposures:&lt;/em&gt; The adenoma detection rate of each patient&amp;rsquo;s physician based on screening examinations in the calendar year prior to the patient&amp;rsquo;s negative colonoscopy. Adenoma detection rate was defined as a continuous variable in statistical analyses and was also dichotomized as at or above vs below the median for descriptive analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main outcomes and measures:&lt;/em&gt; The primary outcome (postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer) was tumor registry-verified colorectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed at least 6 months after any negative colonoscopy (all indications). The secondary outcomes included death from postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Among 735 396 patients who had 852 624 negative colonoscopies, 440 352 (51.6%) were performed on female patients, median patient age was 61.4 years (IQR, 55.5-67.2 years), median follow-up per patient was 3.25 years (IQR, 1.56-5.01 years), and there were 619 postcolonoscopy colorectal cancers and 36 related deaths during more than 2.4 million person-years of follow-up. The patients of physicians with higher adenoma detection rates had significantly lower risks for postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97 per 1% absolute adenoma detection rate increase [95% CI, 0.96-0.98]) and death from postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer (HR, 0.95 per 1% absolute adenoma detection rate increase [95% CI, 0.92-0.99]) across a broad range of adenoma detection rate values, with no interaction by sex (P value for interaction = .18). Compared with adenoma detection rates below the median of 28.3%, detection rates at or above the median were significantly associated with a lower risk of postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer (1.79 vs 3.10 cases per 10 000 person-years; absolute difference in 7-year risk, -12.2 per 10 000 negative colonoscopies [95% CI, -10.3 to -13.4]; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.52-0.73]) and related deaths (0.05 vs 0.22 cases per 10 000 person-years; absolute difference in 7-year risk, -1.2 per 10 000 negative colonoscopies [95%, CI, -0.80 to -1.69]; HR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.11-0.65]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions and relevance:&lt;/em&gt; Within 3 large community-based settings, colonoscopies by physicians with higher adenoma detection rates were significantly associated with lower risks of postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer across a broad range of adenoma detection rate values. These findings may help inform recommended targets for colonoscopy quality measures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Challenges and Gaps in Innovation for the Performance of Colonoscopy for Screening and Surveillance of Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35688352/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the American Gastroenterological Association&amp;rsquo;s Center for GI Innovation and Technology convened a consensus conference, entitled &amp;ldquo;Colorectal Cancer Screening and Surveillance: Role of Emerging Technology and Innovation to Improve Outcomes.&amp;rdquo; The conference participants, which included more than 60 experts in colorectal cancer, considered recent improvements in colorectal cancer screening rates and polyp detection, persistent barriers to colonoscopy uptake, and opportunities for performance improvement and innovation. This white paper originates from that conference. It aims to summarize current patient- and physician-centered gaps and challenges in colonoscopy, diagnostic and therapeutic challenges affecting colonoscopy uptake, and the potential use of emerging technologies and quality metrics to improve patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clonality and timing of relapsing colorectal cancer metastasis revealed through whole-genome single-cell sequencing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35688262/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35688262/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phylogenetic analysis of single-cells exposes how, where and when malignant cells survive treatment in a personalized manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The relapse originated from the expansion of a single metastatic lineage that slowly evolved in the liver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than 500 mutations are specific to the relapse, including four non-silent mutations with no apparent clinical significance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a clear contribution of chemotherapy exposure to the overall mutational burden of the relapse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recurrence of tumor cells following local and systemic therapy is a significant hurdle in cancer. Most patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) will relapse, despite resection of the metastatic lesions. A better understanding of the evolutionary history of recurrent lesions is required to identify the spatial and temporal patterns of metastatic progression and expose the genetic and evolutionary determinants of therapeutic resistance. With this goal in mind, here we leveraged a unique single-cell whole-genome sequencing dataset from recurrent hepatic lesions of an mCRC patient. Our phylogenetic analysis confirms that the treatment induced a severe demographic bottleneck in the liver metastasis but also that a previously diverged lineage survived this surgery, possibly after migration to a different site in the liver. This lineage evolved very slowly for two years under adjuvant drug therapy and diversified again in a very short period. We identified several non-silent mutations specific to this lineage and inferred a substantial contribution of chemotherapy to the overall, genome-wide mutational burden. All in all, our study suggests that mCRC subclones can migrate locally and evade resection, keep evolving despite rounds of chemotherapy, and re-expand explosively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loss of MMR and TGFBR2 Increases the Susceptibility to Microbiota-Dependent Inflammation-Associated Colon Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35688320/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35688320/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes are causative in Lynch syndrome and a significant proportion of sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs). MMR-deficient (dMMR) CRCs display increased mutation rates, with mutations frequently accumulating at short repetitive DNA sequences throughout the genome (microsatellite instability). The TGFBR2 gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in dMMR CRCs. Therefore, we generated an animal model to study how the loss of both TGFBR2 signaling impacts dMMR-driven intestinal tumorigenesis in vivo and explore the impact of the gut microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We generated VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice in which Msh2loxP and Tgfbr2loxP alleles are inactivated by Villin-Cre recombinase in the intestinal epithelium. VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice were analyzed for their rate of intestinal cancer development and for the mutational spectra and gene expression profiles of tumors. In addition, we assessed the impact of chemically induced chronic inflammation and gut microbiota composition on colorectal tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice developed small intestinal adenocarcinomas and CRCs with histopathological features highly similar to CRCs in Lynch syndrome patients. The CRCs in VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice were associated with the presence of colitis and displayed genetic and histological features that resembled inflammation-associated CRCs in human patients. The development of CRCs in VCMsh2/Tgfbr2 mice was strongly modulated by the gut microbiota composition, which in turn was impacted by the TGFBR2 status of the tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results demonstrate a synergistic interaction between MMR and TGFBR2 inactivation in inflammation-associated colon tumorigenesis and highlight the crucial impact of the gut microbiota on modulating the incidence of inflammation-associated CRCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stress-induced epinephrine promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness of CRC through the CEBPB/TRIM2/P53 axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35672760/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Previous studies have indicated that chronic emotional stressors likely participate in the occurrence of cancers. However, direct evidence connecting stress and colorectal cancer development remains almost completely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic stress mouse model was used to investigate the influence of stress on tumorigenesis. Several major agonists and antagonists of adrenergic receptors were applied to investigate the effects of β-adrenergic signaling on the development of CRC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (CHIP) were used to investigate the binding of p53 and CEBPB to TRIM2 promoter. Mammosphere cultures, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony-formation assay, scratch wound healing assays, qPCR, immunofluorescence, coimmunoprecipitation and western blotting were used to explore the effect of stress-induced epinephrine on the CEBPB/TRIM2/P53 axis and the progress of CRC cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we found that stress-induced epinephrine (EPI) promotes the proliferation, metastasis and CSC generation of CRC primarily through the β2-adrenergic receptor. Furthermore, our studies also confirmed that chronic stress decreased the stability of p53 protein by promoting p53 ubiquitination. Results of transcriptome sequencing indicated that TRIM2 was overexpressed in cells treated with EPI. Further studies indicated that TRIM2 could regulate the stability of p53 protein by promoting p53 ubiquitination. Finally, we further proved that CEBPB was regulated by EPI and acts as the upstream transcription factor of TRIM2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our studies proved that stress-induced EPI promotes the development and stemness of CRC through the CEBPB/TRIM2/P53 axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The regulatory effect of fermented black barley on the gut microbiota and metabolic dysbiosis in mice exposed to cigarette smoke</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35761699/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; kisonensisfermented black barley could alleviate the harmful effects of cigarette smoking in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The beneficial effect of fermented black barley may attribute to its regulation on gut microbiota dysbiosis. 3.Fermented black barley could also regulate the metabolic dysbiosis of lipids, amino acids, vitamin, and steroid hormones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoking is a global public health event that can cause oxidative stress and gut microbiota dysbiosis and is related to the occurrence of diseases such as cancer and respiratory system disease. We previously found that fermented black barley was rich in antioxidative components such as polyphenols and flavonoids and regulated gut microbiota dysbiosis. In the present study, the protective effects of fermented black barley on cigarette smoke-induced damage, such as lung, reproduction organ injury, gut microbiota and metabolic dysbiosis, were investigated. Fermented black barley (100 μL/10 g·BW per day, containing 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; CFU/mL &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt;) was administered orally to male ICR mice that were regularly exposed to cigarette smoke (one time a day, 15 cigarettes each time, 30 min/time). The intervention lasted continuously for 12 weeks. The results showed that compared to the group exposed only to cigarette smoke, fermented black barley treatment alleviated the pathological damage to lung and testis tissues and significantly increased the total sperm motility and antioxidative capacity of the lung. Fermented black barley also regulated the intestinal microbiome diversity; reduced the relative abundances of &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;; and increased the relative abundances of &lt;em&gt;Oscillospira&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ruminococcus&lt;/em&gt; at the genus level. Furthermore, the metabolic profile was investigated via analysis of the abundances of fecal and hepatic metabolites, and it was shown that fermented black barley treatment alleviated the metabolic dysbiosis of lipids, amino acids, and the biosynthesis of steroid hormones (such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, etc.) induced by cigarette smoking, which approached normal conditions. These regulatory effects may partially elucidate the beneficial role of fermented black barley in alleviating the harmful effects of cigarette smoking. In summary, supplementation with fermented cereal food may be a helpful way to ameliorate cigarette smoking-induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Lack of viral reference genomes poses a challenge to virome study. We investigated human gut virome and its clinical implication by ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We extracted sufficient viral DNA from human feces for ultra-deep PacBio sequencing (&amp;gt;10 μg) and Illumina sequencing (&amp;gt;1 μg). Upon de novo assembly and 6 stages of strict filtering, viral genomes were generated and validated in 3 cohorts of 2819 published fecal metagenomes. Diagnostic performance of assembled viruses for colorectal cancer were tested in a training cohort and 2 independent validation cohorts. Virus mapping ratio, evolutionary history, and virus status (lytic or temperate) were also examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The mean amount of extracted viral DNA increased by 14-fold compared with previous protocols. We obtained PacBio long reads and Illumina short reads with 290-fold higher depth than previous studies. We assembled and validated 1178 contigs as complete viral genomes, of which 1058 were newly identified. Thirteen viral genomes (398-839 kb) that are longer than the largest bacteriophage found in humans (393 kb) were discovered. Phylogenetic tree was constructed based on Hidden Markov Models alignment scores of 4 conserved viral proteins. Incorporating our assembled genomes into the National Center for Biotechnology Information database improved the mapping ratio of published metagenomes ≤18 times. Lytic viruses (75.9% ± 12.2% of total) were predominantly present in our sample. A biomarker panel of 14 novel viruses could discriminate patients with colorectal cancer from controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.87 in the training cohort, which was validated with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.85 and 0.73 in 2 independent cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We uncovered 1058 novel human gut viruses. These findings can contribute to clinical diagnosis, current viral reference genome, and future virome investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancers express abundant repeat elements that have a viral-like life cycle that can be therapeutically targeted with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) commonly used for viral diseases. NRTIs induce DNA damage and interferon response that provide a new anticancer therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A high-calorie diet aggravates LPS-induced pneumonia by disturbing the gut microbiota and Th17/Treg balance</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intestinal flora plays an important role in the inflammatory response to the systemic or local infections in the host. A high-calorie diet has been shown to aggravate pneumonia and delay recovery, especially in children. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous studies demonstrated that a high-calorie diet and LPS atomization synergistically promoted lung inflammation injury in juvenile rats. In this study, specific pathogen-free juvenile rats were placed in a routine environment, and subjected to a high-calorie diet or LPS atomization in isolation as well as combination. Our data revealed that LPS nebulization combined with a high-calorie diet resulted in significant changes in rats, such as slow weight gain, increased lung index, and aggravated lung inflammatory damage. Meanwhile, we found that the aggravation of LPS-induced pneumonia by a high-calorie diet disturbs the balance of Th17/Treg cells. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of intestinal contents revealed that a high-calorie diet changed the gut microbiome composition, decreased microbial diversity, and particularly reduced the abundance of the intestinal microbiota associated with the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in rats. Consequently, the levels of SCFAs, especially acetate, propionate, and butyrate, were significantly decreased following the intervention of a high-calorie diet. More critically, the effects of a high-calorie diet were shown to be transmissible among pneumonia rats through cohousing microbiota transplantation. Taken together, we provide evidence to support that a high-calorie diet can potentially reset the gut microbiome and metabolites, disrupt Th17/Treg cell balance and immune homeostasis, and aggravate LPS-induced lung inflammatory damage, which may provide a new perspective on the pathogenesis of lung inflammation injury, and suggest a novel microbiota-targeting therapy for inflammatory lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intracellular complement C5a/C5aR1 stabilizes β-catenin to promote colorectal tumorigenesis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35649359/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colonic epithelial cells contain intracellular stores of complement C5 and C5aR1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cathepsin D cleaves C5 to produce C5a in lysosomes and endosomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The C5a/C5aR1/KCTD5/cullin3/Roc-1 complex potentiates β-catenin stability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genetic loss or pharmacological blockade of C5aR1 impedes colorectal tumorigenesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complement is operative in not only the extracellular but also the intracellular milieu. However, little is known about the role of complement activation inside tumor cells. Here, we report that intracellular C5 is cleaved by cathepsin D (CTSD) to produce C5a in lysosomes and endosomes of colonic cancer cells. After stimulation by C5a, intracellular C5aR1 assembles a complex with KCTD5/cullin3/Roc-1 and β-catenin to promote the switch of polyubiquitination of β-catenin from K48 to K63, which enhances β-catenin stability. Genetic loss or pharmacological blockade of C5aR1 dramatically impedes colorectal tumorigenesis at least by destabilizing β-catenin. In human colorectal cancer specimens, high levels of C5aR1, C5a, and CTSD are closely correlated with elevated β-catenin levels and a poor prognosis. Importantly, intracellular C5a/C5aR1-mediated β-catenin stabilization is also observed ubiquitously in other cell types. Collectively, we identify a machinery for β-catenin activation and provide a potential target for tumor prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound IIc is a novel and effective highly TRAIL-sensitive HDAC inhibitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IIc mediated HCT-116 cell apoptosis through the TRAIL-induced apoptosis signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IIc showed good antitumor efficacy in HCT-116 xenograft model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activation of the TRAIL proapoptotic pathway can promote cancer cell apoptosis. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) also are promising drug targets for cancers, and their synergistic effect with TRAIL can improve the inhibitory effect on cancer cells. Therefore, the development of highly TRAIL-sensitive HDAC inhibitors might be a promising strategy for the treatment of cancers. We synthesized a series of HDAC inhibitors by introducing effective fragments sensitive to TRAIL. Compound IIc showed good inhibitory activity against HDAC1 and HCT116 cells and showed higher sensitivity to activating the expression of the TRAIL protein and promoting the apoptosis of HCT-116 cells compared with ONC201. The inhibitory activity of compound IIc (25 mg/kg) in the HCT-116 xenograft model was significantly greater than those of the positive control drugs (ONC201, chidamide). These findings suggested that development of highly TRAIL-sensitive HDAC inhibitors as colorectal tumor cancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Perspectives of using microRNA-loaded nanocarriers for epigenetic reprogramming of drug resistant colorectal cancers</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35623562/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic regulation by microRNAs (miRs) demonstrated a promising therapeutic potential of these molecules to regulate genetic activity in different cancers, including colorectal cancers (CRCs). The RNA-based therapy does not change genetic codes in tumor cells but can silence oncogenes and/or reactivate inhibited tumor suppressor genes. In many cancers, specific miRs were shown to promote or stop tumor progression. Among confirmed and powerful epigenetic regulators of colon carcinogenesis and development of resistance are onco-miRs, which include let-7, miR-21, miR-22, miR-23a, miR-27a, miR-34, miR-92, miR-96, miR-125b, miR-135b, miR-182, miR-200c, miR-203, miR-221, miR-421, miR-451, and others. Moreover, various tumor-suppressor miRs (miR-15b-5b, miR-18a, miR-20b, miR-22, miR-96, miR-139-5p, miR-145, miR-149, miR-197, miR-199b, miR-203, miR-214, miR-218, miR-320, miR-375-3p, miR-409-3p, miR-450b-5p, miR-494, miR-577, miR-874, and others) were found silenced in drug-resistant CRCs. Re-expression of tumor suppressor miR is complicated by the chemical nature of miRs that are not long-lasting compounds and require protection from the enzymatic degradation. Several recent studies explored application of miRs using nanocarrier complexes. This study critically describes the most successfully tested nanoparticle complexes used for intracellular delivery of nuclear acids and miRs, including micelles, liposomes, inorganic and polymeric NPs, dendrimers, and aptamers. Nanocarriers shield incorporated miRs and improve the agent stability in circulation. Attachment of antibodies and/or specific peptide or ligands facilitates cell-targeted miR delivery. Addressing in vivo challenges, a broad spectrum of non-toxic materials has been tested and indicated reliable advantages of lipid-based (lipoplexes) and polymer-based liposomes. Recent cutting-edge developments indicated that lipid-based complexes with multiple cargo, including several miRs, are the most effective approach to eradicate drug-resistant tumors. Focusing on CRC-specific miRs, this review provides a guidance and insights towards the most promising direction to achieve dramatic reduction in tumor growth and metastasis using miR-nanocarrier complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FL118, acting as a &#39;molecular glue degrader&#39;, binds to dephosphorylates and degrades the oncoprotein DDX5 (p68) to control c-Myc, survivin and mutant Kras against colorectal and pancreatic cancer with high efficacy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35604033/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35604033/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a difficult-to-treat cancer, is expected to become the second-largest cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030, while colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths. Currently, there is no effective treatment for PDAC patients. The development of novel agents to effectively treat these cancers remains an unmet clinical need. FL118, a novel anticancer small molecule, exhibits high efficacy against cancers; however, the direct biochemical target of FL118 is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; FL118 affinity purification, mass spectrometry, Nanosep centrifugal device and isothermal titration calorimetry were used for identifying and confirming FL118 binding to DDX5/p68 and its binding affinity. Immunoprecipitation (IP), western blots, real-time reverse transcription PCR, gene silencing, overexpression (OE) and knockout (KO) were used for analysing gene/protein function and expression. Chromatin IP was used for analysing protein-DNA interactions. The 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromid assay and human PDAC/CRC cell/tumour models were used for determining PDAC/CRC cell/tumour in vitro and in vivo growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We discovered that FL118 strongly binds to dephosphorylates and degrades the DDX5 oncoprotein via the proteasome degradation pathway without decreasing DDX5 mRNA. Silencing and OE of DDX5 indicated that DDX5 is a master regulator for controlling the expression of multiple oncogenic proteins, including survivin, Mcl-1, XIAP, cIAP2, c-Myc and mutant Kras. Genetic manipulation of DDX5 in PDAC cells affects tumour growth. PDAC cells with DDX5 KO are resistant to FL118 treatment. Our human tumour animal model studies further indicated that FL118 exhibits high efficacy to eliminate human PDAC and CRC tumours that have a high expression of DDX5, while FL118 exhibits less effectiveness in PDAC and CRC tumours with low DDX5 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; DDX5 is a bona fide FL118 direct target and can act as a biomarker for predicting PDAC and CRC tumour sensitivity to FL118. This would greatly impact FL118 precision medicine for patients with advanced PDAC or advanced CRC in the clinic. FL118 may act as a &amp;lsquo;molecular glue degrader&amp;rsquo; to directly glue DDX5 and ubiquitination regulators together to degrade DDX5.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zinc finger protein 280C contributes to colorectal tumorigenesis by maintaining epigenetic repression at H3K27me3-marked loci</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35605119/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study uncovered the role of ZNF280C, a known DNA damage response protein, as a tumorigenic transcription regulator that contributes to colorectal tumorigenesis and metastasis through maintaining an epigenetic repression program at key cancer gene loci. These findings identified a contributor with potential prognostic value to colorectal pathogenesis and provide mechanistic insight to the essential function of transcription factor in fine-tuning the activity of chromatin regulators for proper transcription control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulated epigenetic and transcriptional programming due to abnormalities of transcription factors (TFs) contributes to and sustains the oncogenicity of cancer cells. Here, we unveiled the role of zinc finger protein 280C (ZNF280C), a known DNA damage response protein, as a tumorigenic TF in colorectal cancer (CRC), required for colitis-associated carcinogenesis and Apc deficiency–driven intestinal tumorigenesis in mice. Consistently, ZNF280C silencing in human CRC cells inhibited proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, xenograft growth, and liver metastasis. As a C2H2 (Cys2-His2) zinc finger-containing TF, ZNF280C occupied genomic intervals with both transcriptionally active and repressive states and coincided with CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin binding. Notably, ZNF280C was crucial for the repression program of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3)-marked genes and the maintenance of both focal and broad H3K27me3 levels. Mechanistically, ZNF280C counteracted CTCF/cohesin activities and condensed the chromatin environment at the cis elements of certain tumor suppressor genes marked by H3K27me3, at least partially through recruiting the epigenetic repressor structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain-containing 1 (SMCHD1). In clinical relevance, ZNF280C was highly expressed in primary CRCs and distant metastases, and a higher ZNF280C level independently predicted worse prognosis of CRC patients. Thus, our study uncovered a contributor with good prognostic value to CRC pathogenesis and also elucidated the essence of DNA-binding TFs in orchestrating the epigenetic programming of gene regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dual-hairpin ligation amplification enabled ultra-sensitive and selective ATP detection for cancer monitor</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35653851/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35653851/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The detection is developed from DHLA, a new isothermal amplification technique with ultra-high signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The detection is ultra-sensitive with a ∼fM level sensitivity, being of magnitude lower than previously reported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The detection is ultra-selective to ATP from its analogues, such as GTP, CTP, UTP and adenosine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has been successfully utilized to detect ATP from colon cell line and cell culture medium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abnormal concentration of ATP is related to many diseases such as Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease, hypoglycaemia, inflammation and cancer. However, most of the reported strategies exhibit moderate sensitivity with ∼nM level detection limit and few of them can distinguish ATP from its analogues, such as GTP, CTP, UTP and adenosine. Herein, we report an ultra-sensitive and selective ATP detection strategy that combines dual hairpin ligation-induced isothermal amplification (DHLA) with ATP-dependent enzymatic reaction. A good linear relationship between Cq value and ATP concentration in the range from 16 fM to 160 nM is acquired. Meanwhile, the strategy can distinguish ATP from its analogues with high selectivity. Furthermore, our proposed strategy has been successfully utilized to detect ATP from colon cell line and cell culture media with great potential applications in cell metabolism and cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging role for thymic stromal lymphopoietin-responsive regulatory T cells in colorectal cancer progression in humans and mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35584230/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulating regulatory T cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory T cells (T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt;) are a well-known marker of cancer progression, and the tumor-derived cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is thought to influence the function of T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt; in the tumor microenvironment. Here, Obata-Ninomiya et al. examine this relationship in the context of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis. They saw T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt; expressing the receptor for TSLP that were enriched in the peripheral blood and tumors of patients and mice with CRC. They treated a chemically induced CRC mouse model with TSLP monoclonal antibodies that inhibited the progression of CRC. TSLP represents a potential therapeutic target to regulate T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; function and control CRC progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruitment of regulatory T cells (T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt;) to tumors is a hallmark of cancer progression. Tumor-derived factors, such as the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), can influence T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; function in tumors. In our study, we identified a subset of T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt; expressing the receptor for TSLP (TSLPR+ T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt;) that were increased in colorectal tumors in humans and mice and largely absent in adjacent normal colon. This T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; subset was also found in the peripheral blood of patients with colon cancer but not in the peripheral blood of healthy control subjects. Mechanistically, we found that this T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; subset coexpressed the interleukin-33 (IL-33) receptor [suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2)] and had high programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) expression, regulated in part by the transcription factor Mef2c. T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt;-specific deletion of TSLPR, but not ST2, was associated with a reduction in tumor number and size with concomitant increase in T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 cells in tumors in chemically induced mouse models of colorectal cancer. Therapeutic blockade of TSLP using TSLP-specific monoclonal antibodies effectively inhibited the progression of colorectal tumors in this mouse model. Collectively, these data suggest that TSLP controls the progression of colorectal cancer through regulation of tumor-specific T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; function and represents a potential therapeutic target that requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Isoliquiritin apioside relieves intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute lung injury by blocking Hif-1α-mediated ferroptosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IA lightened intestinal I/R-induced injury, inflammation and ferroptosis in lung tissues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hif-1α activation promoted lung epithelial ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hif-1α activation abolished the effect of IA on H/R-induced lung epithelial ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isoliquiritin apioside (IA), a critical ingredient of Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma, has been unveiled to possess remarkable pharmacological activity against oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the potential roles of IA in intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) have not been reported yet. In the present study, we explored the effects of IA on I/R-induced ALI, and also clarified the possible mechanisms. To mimic intestinal I/R-induced ALI, the mice were subjected to 60 min of intestinal ischemia via clamping of the superior mesenteric artery followed by 60 min of reperfusion. IA was administered orally (20 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day) for 7 consecutive days before intestinal I/R. Lung epithelial MLE-2 cells were subjected to hypoxia for 2 h and regeneration for 3 h to mimic in vitro ALI. The results showed that IA administration prevented intestinal I/R-induced lung injury, inflammation and edema. Also, IA administration decreased the level of ferroptosis in murine lung tissues challenged with intestinal I/R. In terms of mechanism, IA administration inhibited the protein upregulation of Hif-1α and HO-1 in mice with ALI. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that IA treatment could inhibit the mRNA and protein levels of Hif-1α in hypoxia/regeneration (H/R)-induced MLE-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Hif-1α stabilizer molidustat itself also significantly promoted ferroptosis of MLE-2 cells. And Hif-1α activation increased the mRNA levels of Ptgs2 and Acsl4 but decreased the mRNA level of Gpx4 in H/R-induced MLE-2 cells treated with IA. Taken together, our study unveiled IA could protect against intestinal I/R-induced ALI by decreasing lung epithelial ferroptosis in a Hif-1α-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mucus sialylation determines intestinal host-commensal homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35303419/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A local sialyltransferase dominantly controls intestinal protein sialylation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sialylation protects intestinal mucus integrity from bacterial degradation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mucus sialylation is critical for commensalism and bacterial metabolite homeostasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treatment with sialylated mucins ameliorates gut inflammation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intestinal mucus forms the first line of defense against bacterial invasion while providing nutrition to support microbial symbiosis. How the host controls mucus barrier integrity and commensalism is unclear. We show that terminal sialylation of glycans on intestinal mucus by ST6GALNAC1 (ST6), the dominant sialyltransferase specifically expressed in goblet cells and induced by microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns, is essential for mucus integrity and protecting against excessive bacterial proteolytic degradation. Glycoproteomic profiling and biochemical analysis of ST6 mutations identified in patients show that decreased sialylation causes defective mucus proteins and congenital inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mice harboring a patient ST6 mutation have compromised mucus barriers, dysbiosis, and susceptibility to intestinal inflammation. Based on our understanding of the ST6 regulatory network, we show that treatment with sialylated mucin or a Foxo3 inhibitor can ameliorate IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analysis of PANoptosis-Related LncRNA-miRNA-mRNA Network Reveals LncRNA SNHG7 Involved in Chemo-Resistance in Colon Adenocarcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35646635/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is one of the most common malignancies, and its metastatic lesions are the leading cause of death in COAD patients. PANoptosis is a recently identified pathway for programmed cell death implicated in developing COAD. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of cancer occurrence and progress. Although their function has captured much attention in COAD, the relationship between COAD metastasis-associated lncRNA expression and PANoptosis remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the potential regulatory roles of metastasis- and PANoptosis-associated lncRNAs in COAD. Nine lncRNAs associated with metastasis and PANoptosis in COAD were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GEO databases. Their functions were analyzed by multiple bioinformatics methods, and the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed. Multivariate Cox analysis identified one lncRNA (SNHG7) significantly related to COAD prognosis. Subsequent analyses showed its expression correlated with tumor stage and lymph node metastasis. Moreover, drug sensitivity analysis and in vitro experiments suggest that lncRNA SNHG7 contributes to drug resistance in COAD. In summary, lncRNA SNHG7 is a potential target for diagnosing and treating COAD and plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis, metastasis, and drug resistance in COAD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Therapeutic potential of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of NAFLD: A promising drug Potentilla discolor Bunge</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36176915/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive accumulation of hepatic lipids and metabolic stress-induced liver injury. There are currently no approved effective pharmacological treatments for NAFLD. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for centuries to treat patients with chronic liver diseases without clear disease types and mechanisms. More recently, TCM has been shown to have unique advantages in the treatment of NAFLD. We performed a systematic review of the medical literature published over the last two decades and found that many TCM formulas have been reported to be beneficial for the treatment of metabolic dysfunctions, including &lt;em&gt;Potentilla discolor&lt;/em&gt; Bunge (PDB). PDB has a variety of active compounds, including flavonoids, terpenoids, organic acids, steroids and tannins. Many compounds have been shown to exhibit a series of beneficial effects for the treatment of NAFLD, including anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory functions, improvement of lipid metabolism and reversal of insulin resistance. In this review, we summarize potential therapeutic effects of TCM formulas for the treatment of NAFLD, focusing on the medicinal properties of natural active compounds from PDB and their underlying mechanisms. We point out that PDB can be classified as a novel candidate for the treatment and prevention of NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The gut microbiota prime systemic antiviral immunity via the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35545033/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppression of gut microbiota renders mice susceptible to systemic viral infections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gut microbiota drive systemic antiviral immunity via IFN-I priming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbiota-driven IFN-I priming involves the cGAS-STING axis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbiota mediate systemic IFN-I priming via DNA-containing membrane vesicles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbiota are vital for immune homeostasis and provide a competitive barrier to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Here, we investigated how gut commensals modulate systemic immunity and response to viral infection. Antibiotic suppression of the gut microbiota reduced systemic tonic type I interferon (IFN-I) and antiviral priming. The microbiota-driven tonic IFN-I-response was dependent on cGAS-STING but not on TLR signaling or direct host-bacteria interactions. Instead, membrane vesicles (MVs) from extracellular bacteria activated the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis by delivering bacterial DNA into distal host cells. DNA-containing MVs from the gut microbiota were found in circulation and promoted the clearance of both DNA (herpes simplex virus type 1) and RNA (vesicular stomatitis virus) viruses in a cGAS-dependent manner. In summary, this study establishes an important role for the microbiota in peripheral cGAS-STING activation, which promotes host resistance to systemic viral infections. Moreover, it uncovers an underappreciated risk of antibiotic use during viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A widely expressed free immunoglobulin κ chain with a unique Vκ4-1/Jκ3 pattern promotes colon cancer invasion and metastasis by activating the integrin β1/FAK pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35533952/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The immunoglobulin κ chain with a unique Vκ4-1/Jκ3 pattern is widely expressed in cancer cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vκ4-1/Jκ3-Igκ is a hydrophobic FLC potentially located in the ECM and promotes cancer progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC interacts with integrin β1 and promotes cancer cells growth and migration via activating the FAK signaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC might be a novel therapeutic target in many cancers, such as colon cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, immunoglobulin (Ig) has been known as an antibody and is expressed only in B lineage cells; importantly, Ig light chains are conjugated to heavy chains to form intact Igs. However, in this study, we found a free Igκ light chain with a unique Vκ4-1/Jκ3 rearrangement (Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC) that was widely expressed in different non-B lineages and was overexpressed in cancer cells. Further study indicated that Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC was hydrophobic, formed obvious insoluble deposits in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and existed in free form. Functional analyses demonstrated that Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC promoted the proliferation, migration and metastasis of colon cancer cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Mechanistically, Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC bound to integrin β1 and activated the FAK and Src pathways. More importantly, specific antibodies against the variable region of Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC significantly inhibited the growth of colon cancer tumors. Our findings suggested that Vκ4-1/Jκ3-FLC is a novel ECM protein and integrin β1 ligand and that it is involved in cancer progression and is a potential therapeutic target in cancer, particularly colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting DCLK1 overcomes 5-fluorouracil resistance in colorectal cancer through inhibiting CCAR1/β-catenin pathway-mediated cancer stemness</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35522902/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35522902/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; To date, 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is very important for locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). However, chemotherapy resistance results in tumor recurrence and metastasis, which is a major obstacle for treatment of CRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In the current research, we establish 5-fluorouracil resistant cell lines and explore the potential targets associated with 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC. Moreover, we perform clinical specimen research, in vitro and in vivo experiments and molecular mechanism research, to reveal the biological effects and the mechanism of DCLK1 promoting 5-fluorouracil resistance, and to clarify the potential clinical value of DCLK1 as a target of 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We discover that doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), a cancer stem cell maker, is correlated with 5-fluorouracil resistance, and functionally promotes cancer stemness and 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC. Mechanistically, we elucidate that DCLK1 interacts with cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) through the C-terminal domain, and phosphorylates CCAR1 at the Ser343 site, which is essential for CCAR1 stabilisation. Moreover, we find that DCLK1 positively regulates β-catenin signalling via CCAR1, which is responsible for maintaining cancer stemness. Subsequently, we prove that blocking β-catenin inhibits DCLK1-mediated 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that DCLK1 inhibitor could block CCAR1/β-catenin pathway-mediated cancer stemness and consequently suppresses 5-fluorouracil resistant CRC cells in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, our findings reveal that DCLK1 promotes 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC by CCAR1/β-catenin pathway-mediated cancer stemness, and suggest that targeting DCLK1 might be a promising method to eliminate cancer stem cells for overcoming 5-fluorouracil resistance in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KLF16 enhances stress tolerance of colorectal carcinomas by modulating nucleolar homeostasis and translational reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35524408/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translational reprogramming is part of the unfolded protein response (UPR) during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which acts to the advantage of cancer growth and development in different stress conditions, but the mechanism of ER stress-related translational reprogramming in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) progression remains unclear. Here, we identified that Krüppel-like factor 16 (KLF16) can promote CRC progression and stress tolerance through translational reprogramming. The expression of KLF16 was upregulated in CRC tissues and associated with poor prognosis for CRC patients. We found that ER stress inducers can recruit KLF16 to the nucleolus and increase its interaction with two essential proteins for nucleolar homeostasis: nucleophosmin1 (NPM1) and fibrillarin (FBL). Moreover, knockdown of KLF16 can dysregulate nucleolar homeostasis in CRC cells. Translation-reporter system and polysome profiling assays further showed that KLF16 can effectively promote cap-independent translation of ATF4, which can enhance ER-phagy and the proliferation of CRC cells. Overall, our study unveils a previously unrecognized role for KLF16 as an ER stress regulator through mediating translational reprogramming to enhance the stress tolerance of CRC cells and provides a potential therapeutic vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genome-Protective Topoisomerase 2a-Dependent G2 Arrest Requires p53 in hTERT-Positive Cancer Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35247890/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topoisomerase 2a (Topo2a)-dependent G2 arrest engenders faithful segregation of sister chromatids, yet in certain tumor cell lines where this arrest is dysfunctional, a PKCε-dependent failsafe pathway can be triggered. Here we elaborate on recent advances in understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with this G2 arrest by determining that p53-p21 signaling is essential for efficient arrest in cell lines, in patient-derived cells, and in colorectal cancer organoids. Regulation of this p53 axis required the SMC5/6 complex, which is distinct from the p53 pathways observed in the DNA damage response. Topo2a inhibition specifically during S phase did not trigger G2 arrest despite affecting completion of DNA replication. Moreover, in cancer cells reliant upon the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism, a distinct form of Topo2a-dependent, p53-independent G2 arrest was found to be mediated by BLM and Chk1. Importantly, the previously described PKCε-dependent mitotic failsafe was engaged in hTERT-positive cells when Topo2a-dependent G2 arrest was dysfunctional and where p53 was absent, but not in cells dependent on the ALT mechanism. In PKCε knockout mice, p53 deletion elicited tumors were less aggressive than in PKCε-replete animals and exhibited a distinct pattern of chromosomal rearrangements. This evidence suggests the potential of exploiting synthetic lethality in arrest-defective hTERT-positive tumors through PKCε-directed therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have been shown to model clinical response to cancer therapy. However, it remains challenging to use these models to guide timely clinical decisions for cancer patients. Here, we used droplet emulsion microfluidics with temperature control and dead-volume minimization to rapidly generate thousands of micro-organospheres (MOSs) from low-volume patient tissues, which serve as an ideal patient-derived model for clinical precision oncology. A clinical study of recently diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients using an MOS-based precision oncology pipeline reliably assessed tumor drug response within 14 days, a timeline suitable for guiding treatment decisions in the clinic. Furthermore, MOSs capture original stromal cells and allow T cell penetration, providing a clinical assay for testing immuno-oncology (IO) therapies such as PD-1 blockade, bispecific antibodies, and T cell therapies on patient tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting SMYD2 inhibits angiogenesis and increases the efficiency of apatinib by suppressing EGFL7 in colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angiogenesis is an essential factor affecting the occurrence and development of solid tumors. SET And MYND Domain Containing 2 (SMYD2) serves as an oncogene in various cancers. However, whether SMYD2 is involved in tumor angiogenesis remains unclear. Here, we report that SMYD2 expression is associated with microvessel density in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. SMYD2 promotes CRC angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SMYD2 physically interacts with HNRNPK and mediates lysine monomethylation at K422 of HNRNPK, which substantially increases RNA binding activity. HNRNPK acts by binding and stabilizing EGFL7 mRNA. As an angiogenic stimulant, EGFL7 enhances CRC angiogenesis. H3K4me3 maintained by PHF8 mediates the abnormal overexpression of SMYD2 in CRC. Moreover, targeting SMYD2 blocks CRC angiogenesis in tumor xenografts. Treatment with BAY-598, a functional inhibitor of SMYD2, can also synergize with apatinib in patient-derived xenografts. Overall, our findings reveal a new regulatory axis of CRC angiogenesis and provide a potential strategy for antiangiogenic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel β-catenin/BCL9 complex inhibitor blocks oncogenic Wnt signaling and disrupts cholesterol homeostasis in colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of many human cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), making it an attractive clinical target. With the aim of inhibiting oncogenic Wnt activity, we developed a high-throughput screening AlphaScreen assay to identify selective small-molecule inhibitors of the interaction between β-catenin and its coactivator BCL9. We identified a compound that consistently bound to β-catenin and specifically inhibited in vivo native β-catenin/BCL9 complex formation in CRC cell lines. This compound inhibited Wnt activity, down-regulated expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signature in gene expression studies, disrupted cholesterol homeostasis, and significantly reduced the proliferation of CRC cell lines and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of CRC. This study has therefore identified a specific small-molecule inhibitor of oncogenic Wnt signaling, which may have value as a probe for functional studies and has important implications for the development of novel therapies in patients with CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long noncoding RNA LINC01606 protects colon cancer cells from ferroptotic cell death and promotes stemness by SCD1-Wnt/β-catenin-TFE3 feedback loop signalling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35485210/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ferroptosis is principally caused by iron catalytic activity and intracellular lipid peroxidation. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in tumorigenesis. However, the potential interplay between lncRNA LINC01606 and ferroptosis in colon cancer remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The expression level of LNC01606 in colon cancer tissue was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The functional role of LNC01606 was investigated by gain- and loss-of-function assays both in vitro and in vivo. The LINC01606-SCD1-Wnt/β-catenin-TFE3 axis were screened and validated by DNA/RNA pull down, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The expression of lncRNA LINC01606 was frequently upregulated in human colon cancer and strongly associated with a poor prognosis. LINC01606 functioned as an oncogene and promotes colon cancer cell growth, invasion and stemness both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, LINC01606 protected colon cancer cells from ferroptosis by decreasing the concentration of iron, lipid reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial superoxide and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential. Mechanistically, LINC01606 enhanced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), serving as a competing endogenous RNA to modulate miR-423-5p expression, subsequently activating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3 (TFE3) increased LINC01606 transcription after recruitment to the promoter regions of LINC01606. Furthermore, we confirmed that upregulated LINC01606 and Wnt/β-catenin formed a positive feedback regulatory loop, further inhibiting ferroptosis and enhancing stemness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; LINC01606 functions as an oncogene to facilitate tumor cell stemness, proliferation and inhibit ferroptosis and is a promising therapeutic target for colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional genetic screen identifies ITPR3/calcium/RELB axis as a driver of colorectal cancer metastatic liver colonization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35487218/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of ITPR3 in colorectal cancer cells inhibits metastatic liver colonization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RELB acts downstream of ITPR3/calcium to promote colorectal cancer liver metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITPR3 and RELB regulate survival in response to hypoxia and substratum detachment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure of colorectal cancer cells to ITPR3 inhibitor caffeine reduces liver metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metastatic colonization is the primary cause of death from colorectal cancer (CRC). We employed genome-scale in vivo short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening and validation to identify 26 promoters of CRC liver colonization. Among these genes, we identified a cluster that contains multiple targetable genes, including ITPR3, which promoted liver-metastatic colonization and elicited similar downstream gene expression programs. ITPR3 is a caffeine-sensitive inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor that releases calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and enhanced metastatic colonization by inducing expression of RELB, a transcription factor that is associated with non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Genetic, cell biological, pharmacologic, and clinical association studies revealed that ITPR3 and RELB drive CRC colony formation by promoting cell survival upon substratum detachment or hypoxic exposure. RELB was sufficient to drive colonization downstream of ITPR3. Our findings implicate the ITPR3/calcium/RELB axis in CRC metastatic colony formation and uncover multiple clinico-pathologically associated targetable proteins as drivers of CRC metastatic colonization.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Germline MBD4 deficiency causes a multi-tumor predisposition syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35460607/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report an autosomal recessive, multi-organ tumor predisposition syndrome, caused by bi-allelic loss-of-function germline variants in the base excision repair (BER) gene MBD4. We identified five individuals with bi-allelic MBD4 variants within four families and these individuals had a personal and/or family history of adenomatous colorectal polyposis, acute myeloid leukemia, and uveal melanoma. MBD4 encodes a glycosylase involved in repair of G:T mismatches resulting from deamination of 5&amp;rsquo;-methylcytosine. The colorectal adenomas from MBD4-deficient individuals showed a mutator phenotype attributable to mutational signature SBS1, consistent with the function of MBD4. MBD4-deficient polyps harbored somatic mutations in similar driver genes to sporadic colorectal tumors, although AMER1 mutations were more common and KRAS mutations less frequent. Our findings expand the role of BER deficiencies in tumor predisposition. Inclusion of MBD4 in genetic testing for polyposis and multi-tumor phenotypes is warranted to improve disease management.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ketogenesis Attenuates KLF5-Dependent Production of CXCL12 to Overcome the Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment in Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35247887/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME) can markedly alter the response to targeted therapies for colorectal cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are major components of TMEs that can direct and induce infiltration of immunosuppressive cells through secreted cytokines such as CXCL12. Ketogenic diets (KD) can inhibit tumor growth and enhance the anticancer effects of immune checkpoint blockade. However, the role of ketogenesis on the immunosuppressive TME is not known. Here, we show that decreased ketogenesis is a signature of colorectal cancer and that an increase in ketogenesis using a KD decreases CXCL12 production in tumors, serum, liver, and lungs. Moreover, increasing ketogenesis by overexpression of the ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) or treatment with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate markedly decreased expression of KLF5, which binds the CXCL12 promoter and induces CXCL12 expression in CAFs. KD decreased intratumoral accumulation of immunosuppressive cells, increased infiltration of natural killer and cytotoxic T cells, and enhanced the anticancer effects of PD-1 blockade in murine-derived colorectal cancer. Furthermore, increasing ketogenesis inhibited colorectal cancer migration, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Overall, ketogenesis is downregulated in the colorectal cancer TME, and increased ketogenesis represses KLF5-dependent CXCL12 expression to improve the immunosuppressive TME, which leads to the enhanced efficacy of immunotherapy and reduced metastasis. Importantly, this work demonstrates that downregulation of de novo ketogenesis in the TME is a critical step in colorectal cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of mango and mint pod-based e-cigarette aerosol inhalation on inflammatory states of the brain, lung, heart, and colon in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35411847/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While health effects of conventional tobacco are well defined, data on vaping devices, including one of the most popular e-cigarettes which have high nicotine levels, are less established. Prior acute e-cigarette studies have demonstrated inflammatory and cardiopulmonary physiology changes while chronic studies have demonstrated extra-pulmonary effects, including neurotransmitter alterations in reward pathways. In this study we investigated the impact of inhalation of aerosols produced from pod-based, flavored e-cigarettes (JUUL) aerosols three times daily for 3 months on inflammatory markers in the brain, lung, heart, and colon. JUUL aerosol exposure induced upregulation of cytokine and chemokine gene expression and increased HMGB1 and RAGE in the nucleus accumbens in the central nervous system. Inflammatory gene expression increased in the colon, while gene expression was more broadly altered by e-cigarette aerosol inhalation in the lung. Cardiopulmonary inflammatory responses to acute lung injury with lipopolysaccharide were exacerbated in the heart. Flavor-specific findings were detected across these studies. Our findings suggest that daily e-cigarette use may cause neuroinflammation, which may contribute to behavioral changes and mood disorders. In addition, e-cigarette use may cause gut inflammation, which has been tied to poor systemic health, and cardiac inflammation, which leads to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Corneal fibroblast collagen type IV negative feedback modulation of TGF beta: A fibrosis modulating system likely active in other organs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collagen type IV binds TGF beta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TGF beta upregulates collagen type IV production in stromal corneal fibroblasts apart from basement membranes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-basement membrane collagen type IV production likely represents a negative feedback regulatory pathway to modulate myofibroblast generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collagen type IV (COL IV) is a major component of basement membranes (BM) in all organs. It serves functions related to BM organization and modulates the passage of growth factors from one tissue compartment to another. COL IV binds transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-1 and TGF beta-2 and, therefore, is a major modulator of TGF beta pro-fibrotic functions. After fibrotic corneal injury, TGF beta enters into the stroma from the tears, epithelium, endothelium and/or aqueous humor and markedly upregulates COL IV production in corneal fibroblasts in the adjacent stroma far removed from BMs. It is hypothesized this non-BM stromal COL IV binds TGF beta-1 (and likely TGF beta-2) in competition with the binding of the growth factors to TGF beta cognate receptors and serves as a negative feedback regulatory pathway to mitigate the effects of TGF beta on stromal cells, including reducing the developmental transition of corneal fibroblasts and fibrocytes into myofibroblasts. Losartan, a known TGF beta signaling inhibitor, when applied topically to the cornea after fibrotic injury, alters this COL IV-TGF beta pathway by down-regulating COL IV production by corneal fibroblasts. Non-BM COL IV produced in response to injuries in other organs, including the lung, skin, liver, kidney, and gut, may participate in similar COL IV-TGF beta pathways and have an important role in controlling TGF beta pro-fibrotic effects in these organs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty glycoside derivatives and nine flavonoids from the leaves of &lt;em&gt;Pueraria&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;P. thomsonii&lt;/em&gt;) were isolated by column chromatography and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The contents of twenty glycosides and nine flavonoids from the extract of &lt;em&gt;P. thomsonii&lt;/em&gt; leaf (PL) were 173.3 mg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 134.7 mg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Two flavonoids with the highest content were robinin (49.28 mg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and puerarin (42.87 mg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Six flavonoids, &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; puerarin, robinin, rutin, quercetin, quercitrin, and kaempferol showed more inhibitory effects against α-glucosidase than acarbose. PL could effectively increase the level of insulin, decrease the content of fasting blood glucose, reduce lipid accumulation in plasma, ameliorate oxidative injury and inflammation, and relieve liver and kidney damage in diabetic mice. Moreover, PL could increase intestinal probiotics to improve metabolic disorders caused by diabetes and decrease the level of &lt;em&gt;Clostridium celatum&lt;/em&gt; to relieve inflammation. This study suggested that PL or its glycoside derivatives and flavonoids regulating glycolipid metabolism and inflammation levels might have the potential to be used to control type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) has emerged as a key player in various biological processes. Its atypical &amp;ldquo;intercepting receptor&amp;rdquo; properties have established ACKR3 as the major regulator in the pathophysiological processes in many diseases. In this study, we investigated the role of ACKR3 activation in promoting colorectal tumorigenesis. We showed that ACKR3 expression levels were significantly increased in human colon cancer tissues, and high levels of ACKR3 predicted the increased severity of cancer. In Villin-ACKR3 transgenic mice with a high expression level of CKR3 in their intestinal epithelial cells, administration of AOM/DSS induced more severe colorectal tumorigenesis than their WT littermates. Cancer cells of Villin-ACKR3 transgenic mice were characterised by the nuclear β-arrestin-1 (β-arr1)-activated perturbation of rRNA biogenesis. In HCT116 cells, cotreatment with CXCL12 and AMD3100 selectively activated ACKR3 and induced nuclear translocation of β-arr1, leading to an interaction of β-arr1 with nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 (NOLC1). NOLC1, as the phosphorylated protein, further interacted with fibrillarin, a conserved nucleolar methyltransferase responsible for ribosomal RNA methylation in the nucleolus, thereby increasing the methylation in histone H2A and promoting rRNA transcription in ribosome biogenesis. In conclusion, ACKR3 promotes colorectal tumorigenesis through the perturbation of rRNA biogenesis by the β-arr1-induced interaction of NOLC1 with fibrillarin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common malignancies with limited treatments other than surgery. The tumor microenvironment (TME) profiling enables the discovery of potential therapeutic targets. Here, we profile 54,103 cells from tumor and adjacent tissues to characterize cellular composition and elucidate the potential origin and regulation of tumor-enriched cell types in CRC. We demonstrate that the tumor-specific FAP+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages were positively correlated in 14 independent CRC cohorts containing 2550 samples and validate their close localization by immuno-fluorescent staining and spatial transcriptomics. This interaction might be regulated by chemerin, TGF-β, and interleukin-1, which would stimulate the formation of immune-excluded desmoplasic structure and limit the T cell infiltration. Furthermore, we find patients with high FAP or SPP1 expression achieved less therapeutic benefit from an anti-PD-L1 therapy cohort. Our results provide a potential therapeutic strategy by disrupting FAP+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages interaction to improve immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acoustic Bioprinting of Patient-Derived Organoids for Predicting Cancer Therapy Responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35358375/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer models, which are biologically representative of patient tumors, can predict the treatment responses and help determine the most appropriate cancer treatment for individual patients. Here, a point-of-care testing system called acoustically bioprinted patient-derived microtissues (PDMs) that can model cancer invasion and predict treatment response in individual patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), is reported. The PDMs are composed of patient-derived colorectal tumors and healthy organoids which can be precisely arranged by acoustic bioprinting approach for recapulating primary tissue&amp;rsquo;s architecture. Particularly, these tumor organoids can be efficiently generated and can apprehend histological, genomic, and phenotypical characteristics of primary tumors. Consequently, these PDMs allow physiologically relevant in vitro drug (5-fluorouracil) screens, thus predicting the paired patient&amp;rsquo;s responses to chemotherapy. A correlation between organoid invasion speed and normalized spreading speed of the paired patients is further established. It provides a quantitative indicator to help doctors make better decisions on ultimate anus-preserving operation for extremely low CRC patients. Thus, by combing acoustic bioprinting and organoid cultures, this method may open an avenue to establish complex 3D tissue models for precision and personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microbiota-dependent activation of the myeloid calcineurin-NFAT pathway inhibits B7H3- and B7H4-dependent anti-tumor immunity in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35364006/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbial recognition activates myeloid calcineurin and NFAT in colorectal cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFAT-dependent IL-6 promotes expression of co-inhibitory B7H3 and B7H4 by tumors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B7H3/B7H4 inhibit CD8+ T cells while their blockade elicits protective T cell responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B7H3/B7H4 expression in CRC correlates with poor CD8+ T cell infiltration and survival&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial sensing by intestinal tumor cells contributes to tumor growth through cell-intrinsic activation of the calcineurin-NFAT axis, but the role of this pathway in other intestinal cells remains unclear. Here, we found that myeloid-specific deletion of calcineurin in mice activated protective CD8+ T cell responses and inhibited colorectal cancer (CRC) growth. Microbial sensing by myeloid cells promoted calcineurin- and NFAT-dependent interleukin 6 (IL-6) release, expression of the co-inhibitory molecules B7H3 and B7H4 by tumor cells, and inhibition of CD8+ T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. Accordingly, targeting members of this pathway activated protective CD8+ T cell responses and inhibited primary and metastatic CRC growth. B7H3 and B7H4 were expressed by the majority of human primary CRCs and metastases, which was associated with low numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and poor survival. Therefore, a microbiota-, calcineurin-, and B7H3/B7H4-dependent pathway controls anti-tumor immunity, revealing additional targets for immune checkpoint inhibition in microsatellite-stable CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted colonic drug delivery systems are needed for the treatment of endemic colorectal pathologies, such as Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer. These drug delivery vehicles are difficult to formulate, as they need to remain structurally intact whilst navigating a wide range of physiological conditions across the upper gastrointestinal tract. In this work we show how starch hydrogel bulk structural and molecular level parameters influence their properties as drug delivery platforms. The in vitro protocols mimic in vivo conditions, accounting for physiological concentrations of gastrointestinal hydrolytic enzymes and salts. The structural changes starch gels undergo along the entire length of the human gastrointestinal tract have been quantified, and related to the materials&amp;rsquo; drug release kinetics for three different drug molecules, and interactions with the large intestinal microbiota. It has been demonstrated how one can modify their choice of starch in order to fine tune its corresponding hydrogel&amp;rsquo;s pharmacokinetic profile.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comprehensive characterization of PTEN mutational profile in a series of 34,129 colorectal cancers</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35338148/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of expression or activity of the tumor suppressor PTEN acts similarly to an activating mutation in the oncogene PIK3CA in elevating intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), inducing signaling by AKT and other pro-tumorigenic signaling proteins. Here, we analyze sequence data for 34,129 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, capturing 3,434 PTEN mutations. We identify specific patterns of PTEN mutation associated with microsatellite stability/instability (MSS/MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), patient age, and tumor location. Within groups separated by MSS/MSI status, this identifies distinct profiles of nucleotide hotspots, and suggests differing profiles of protein-damaging effects of mutations. Moreover, discrete categories of PTEN mutations display non-identical patterns of co-occurrence with mutations in other genes important in CRC pathogenesis, including KRAS, APC, TP53, and PIK3CA. These data provide context for clinical targeting of proteins upstream and downstream of PTEN in distinct CRC cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>m6A mRNA modification maintains colonic epithelial cell homeostasis via NF-κB-mediated antiapoptotic pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colonic mucosal barrier dysfunction is one of the major causes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the mechanisms underlying mucosal barrier dysfunction are poorly understood. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modification is an important modulator of epitranscriptional regulation of gene expression, participating in multiple physiological and pathological processes. However, the function of m6A modification in colonic epithelial cells and stem cells is unknown. Here, we show that m6A modification is essential for maintaining the homeostatic self-renewal in colonic stem cells. Specific deletion of the methyltransferase 14 (Mettl14) gene in mouse colon resulted in colonic stem cell apoptosis, causing mucosal barrier dysfunction and severe colitis. Mechanistically, we revealed that Mettl14 restricted colonic epithelial cell death by regulating the stability of Nfkbia mRNA and modulating the NF-κB pathway. Our results identified a previously unidentified role for m6A modification in colonic epithelial cells and stem cells, suggesting that m6A modification may be a potential therapeutic target for IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PUMILIO (PUM) proteins belong to the highly conserved PUF family post-transcriptional regulators involved in diverse biological processes. However, their function in carcinogenesis remains under-explored. Here, we report that &lt;em&gt;Pum1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pum2&lt;/em&gt; display increased expression in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Intestine-specific knockout of &lt;em&gt;Pum1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pum2&lt;/em&gt; in mice significantly inhibits the progression of colitis-associated cancer in the AOM/DSS model. Knockout or knockdown of &lt;em&gt;Pum1&lt;/em&gt; and/or &lt;em&gt;Pum2&lt;/em&gt; in human CRC cells result in a significant decrease in the tumorigenicity and delayed G1/S transition. We identify p21/Cdkn1a as a direct target of PUM1. Abrogation of the PUM1 binding site in the p21 mRNA also results in decreased cancer cell growth and delayed G1/S transition. Furthermore, intravenous injection of nanoparticle-encapsulated anti-&lt;em&gt;Pum1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pum2&lt;/em&gt; siRNAs reduces colorectal tumor growth in murine orthotopic colon cancer models. These findings reveal the requirement of PUM proteins for CRC progression and their potential as therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vitamin D receptor upregulates tight junction protein claudin-5 against colitis-associated tumorigenesis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tight junctions are essential for barrier integrity, inflammation, and cancer. Vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) play important roles in colorectal cancer (CRC). Using the human CRC database, we found colonic VDR expression was low and significantly correlated with a reduction of Claudin-5 mRNA and protein. In the colon of VDRΔIEC mice, deletion of intestinal VDR led to lower protein and mRNA levels of Claudin-5. Intestinal permeability was increased in the VDR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; colon cancer model. Lacking VDR and a reduction of Claudin-5 are associated with an increased number of tumors in the VDR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and VDR&lt;sup&gt;ΔIEC&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Furthermore, gain and loss functional studies have identified CLDN-5 as a downstream target of VDR. We identified the Vitamin D response element (VDRE) binding sites in a reporter system showed that VDRE in the Claudin-5 promoter is required for vitamin D3-induced Claudin-5 expression. Conditional epithelial VDR overexpression protected against the loss of &lt;em&gt;Claudin-5&lt;/em&gt; in response to inflammation and tumorigenesis in vivo. We also reported fecal VDR reduction in a colon cancer model. This study advances the understanding of how VDR regulates intestinal barrier functions in tumorigenesis and the possibility for identifying new biomarker and therapeutic targets to restore VDR-dependent functions in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chitosan oligosaccharide mitigates kidney injury in prediabetic rats by improving intestinal barrier and renal autophagy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) not only increases the risk of metabolic syndrome but also initiates kidney injury. Lipid accumulation-induced systemic low-grade inflammation is an upstream mechanism of kidney injury associated with prediabetes. Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) provides potent anti-obesity effects through several mechanisms including fecal lipid excretion. In this study, we investigated the effects of COS on the prevention of obesity-related complications and its ability to confer renoprotection in a prediabetic model. Rats fed on a HFD developed obesity, glucose intolerance and kidney dysfunction. COS intervention successfully ameliorated these conditions (p &amp;lt; 0.05) by attenuating intestinal lipid absorption and the renal inflammation-autophagy-apoptosis axis. A novel anti-inflammatory effect of COS had been demonstrated by the strengthening of intestinal barrier integrity via calcium-sensing receptor (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The use of COS as a supplement may be useful in reducing prediabetic complications especially renal injury and the risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to limited data on the link between gut barrier defects (leaky gut) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), blood samples of COVID-19 cases-mild (upper respiratory tract symptoms without pneumonia; n = 27), moderate (pneumonia without hypoxia; n = 28), and severe (pneumonia with hypoxia; n = 20)-versus healthy control (n = 15) were evaluated, together with in vitro experiments. Accordingly, neutrophil counts, serum cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacteria-free DNA, and NETs parameters (fluorescent-stained nuclear morphology, dsDNA, neutrophil elastase, histone-DNA complex, and myeloperoxidase-DNA complex) were found to differentiate COVID-19 severity, whereas serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) was different between the control and COVID-19 cases. Despite non-detectable bacteria-free DNA in the blood of healthy volunteers, using blood bacteriome analysis, proteobacterial DNA was similarly predominant in both control and COVID-19 cases (all severities). In parallel, only COVID-19 samples from moderate and severe cases, but not mild cases, were activated in vitro NETs, as determined by supernatant dsDNA, &lt;em&gt;Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase 4&lt;/em&gt;, and nuclear morphology. With neutrophil experiments, LPS plus BG (LPS + BG) more prominently induced NETs, cytokines, NFκB, and reactive oxygen species, when compared with the activation by each molecule alone. In conclusion, pathogen molecules (LPS and BG) from gut translocation along with neutrophilia and cytokinemia in COVID-19-activated, NETs-induced hyperinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The pathogens of secondary infection in septic patients share a similar genotype to those that predominate in the gut</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35331299/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Secondary nosocomial infections, which are commonly caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), often develop in septic patients. This study aimed to identify the origin of secondary systemic pathogens and reveal the underlying mechanism of infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this prospective, observational case-control study, a total of 34 septic patients, 33 non-septic intensive care unit (ICU) patients and 10 healthy individuals serving as controls were enrolled. Three hundred and twelve fecal samples were collected and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Metagenome sequencing was performed to identify the homology between dominant CRKP or VRE in the intestine and pathogens isolated from secondary infectious sites. C57/BL mice were established as pseudo germ-free animal model by pretreatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The abundance and diversity of the gut microbiota in septic patients was drastically decreased one week after ICU admission, potentially leading to the enrichment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as CRKP. Furthermore, secondary bloodstream and abdominal infections caused by CRKP or VRE in septic patients occurred after intestinal colonization with the predominant bacterial species. Genomic analysis showed that bacteria isolated from secondary infection had high homology with the corresponding predominant intestinal opportunistic pathogens. In addition, animal model experiments validated the hypothesis that the administration of antibiotics caused the enrichment of CRKP and VRE among the intestinal microbiota, increasing the likelihood of permeation of other tissues and potentially causing subsequent systemic infection in pseudo germ-free mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study indicated that the pathogens causing secondary infection in septic patients might originate from the intestinal colonization of pathogens following broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatiotemporal reprogramming of differentiated cells underlies regeneration and neoplasia in the intestinal epithelium</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35314700/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the mammalian intestinal epithelium manifests robust regenerative capacity after various cytotoxic injuries, the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. Here we identify the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57 as a specific marker for a quiescent cell population located around the +4 position of intestinal crypts. Lineage tracing reveals that the p57&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells serve as enteroendocrine/tuft cell precursors under normal conditions but dedifferentiate and act as facultative stem cells to support regeneration after injury. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis shows that the p57&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells undergo a dynamic reprogramming process after injury that is characterized by fetal-like conversion and metaplasia-like transformation. Population-level analysis also detects such spatiotemporal reprogramming widely in other differentiated cell types. In intestinal adenoma, p57&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells manifest homeostatic stem cell activity, in the context of constitutively activated spatiotemporal reprogramming. Our results highlight a pronounced plasticity of the intestinal epithelium that supports maintenance of tissue integrity in normal and neoplastic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Detection of recurrent colorectal cancer with high specificity using a reporting threshold for circulating tumor DNA methylated in BCAT1 and IKZF1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35290664/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; A blood assay measuring methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 can detect recurrent colorectal cancer (CRC) with high sensitivity but suboptimal specificity. This study aimed to establish an upper reference limit (URL) of these biomarkers in a reference population without CRC, apply that threshold to detecting clinical recurrence in patients who had undergone definitive therapy for CRC, and compare the performance of the biomarkers with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The level of methylation was reported as the aggregate methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 expressed as a percentage of total plasma DNA. A reference population of patients confirmed to have no colorectal neoplasia (n = 857) was used to determine the URL. Test accuracy for clinical recurrence was determined in a post-treatment surveillance population (n = 549; 77 recurrence cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A methylation level of 0.07%, corresponding to the 98th percentile in the reference population, was set as the URL. In the surveillance population, 60 patients had methylation levels above 0.07%, and 81.7% of these had recurrence. In comparison with no minimum threshold being applied, assay sensitivity with a URL of 0.07% yielded similar sensitivity (63.6% [CI, 51.9%-74.3%] vs 64.9% [CI, 53.8%-74.7%]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .87) and higher specificity (97.7% [CI, 95.9%-98.8%] vs 91.3% [CI, 88.4%-93.5%]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001). The BCAT1/IKZF1 test was 2.5-fold more sensitive than CEA for detecting recurrences considered amenable to surgery with curative intent (50.0% vs 20.8%; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .016).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Applying a threshold for positivity to the methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 blood assay improved the specificity for CRC recurrence without compromising sensitivity. Both the sensitivity and the specificity were superior to those of CEA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Niclosamide induces miR-148a to inhibit PXR and sensitize colon cancer stem cells to chemotherapy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;miR-148a&lt;/em&gt; expression is decreased in colon cancer stem cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forced expression of &lt;em&gt;miR-148a&lt;/em&gt; inhibits colon cancer stem cell chemoresistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-content screening identified niclosamide as a potent &lt;em&gt;miR-148a&lt;/em&gt; inducer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Niclosamide induces &lt;em&gt;miR-148a&lt;/em&gt; expression, inhibits PXR expression in CSCs and prevents tumor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor recurrence is often attributed to cancer stem cells (CSCs). We previously demonstrated that down-regulation of Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) decreases the chemoresistance of CSCs and prevents colorectal cancer recurrence. Currently, no PXR inhibitor is usable in clinic. Here, we identify &lt;em&gt;miR-148a&lt;/em&gt; as a targetable element upstream of PXR signaling in CSCs, which when over-expressed decreases PXR expression and impairs tumor relapse after chemotherapy in mouse tumor xenografts. We then develop a fluorescent reporter screen for &lt;em&gt;miR-148a&lt;/em&gt; activators and identify the anti-helminthic drug niclosamide as an inducer of &lt;em&gt;miR-148a&lt;/em&gt; expression. Consequently, niclosamide decreased PXR expression and CSC numbers in colorectal cancer patient-derived cell lines and synergized with chemotherapeutic agents to prevent CSC chemoresistance and tumor recurrence in vivo. Our study suggests that endogenous miRNA inducers is a viable strategy to down-regulate PXR and illuminates niclosamide as a neoadjuvant repurposing strategy to prevent tumor relapse in colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) are heterogeneous intestinal diseases that threaten the health of an increasing number of individuals as their lifestyles become westernized. New insights have been discovered with the development of various omics techniques, revealing that gut-microbiota-derived metabolites play important roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and modulating the progression of intestinal diseases from both metabolic and immunological perspectives. Clinical metagenomic and metabolomic studies have revealed links between microbial bile acid (BA) metabolism and IBD and CRC progression. Several BA-derived metabolites were recently been demonstrated to play a role in intestinal immunity, providing fresh insights into how BAs affect the course of IBD and CRC. In this review, we discuss recent studies on the involvement of gut microbiota-derived BAs in intestinal immunity, inflammation, and tumorigenesis along with human omics data to provide prospective insights into future prevention and treatment of IBD and CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reovirus infection is regulated by NPC1 and endosomal cholesterol homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35263388/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35263388/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol homeostasis is required for the replication of many viruses, including Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-1. Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is an endosomal-lysosomal membrane protein involved in cholesterol trafficking from late endosomes and lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum. We identified NPC1 in CRISPR and RNA interference screens as a putative host factor for infection by mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus). Following internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the reovirus outer capsid is proteolytically removed, the endosomal membrane is disrupted, and the viral core is released into the cytoplasm where viral transcription, genome replication, and assembly take place. We found that reovirus infection is significantly impaired in cells lacking NPC1, but infection is restored by treatment of cells with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, which binds and solubilizes cholesterol. Absence of NPC1 did not dampen infection by infectious subvirion particles, which are reovirus disassembly intermediates that bypass the endocytic pathway for infection of target cells. NPC1 is not required for reovirus attachment to the plasma membrane, internalization into cells, or uncoating within endosomes. Instead, NPC1 is required for delivery of transcriptionally active reovirus core particles from endosomes into the cytoplasm. These findings suggest that cholesterol homeostasis, ensured by NPC1 transport activity, is required for reovirus penetration into the cytoplasm, pointing to a new function for NPC1 and cholesterol homeostasis in viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TIGAR drives colorectal cancer ferroptosis resistance through ROS/AMPK/SCD1 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35271998/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy and major cause of cancer death in the world. Ferroptosis is a recently identified type of regulated cell death. Increasing evidence has shown that ferroptosis plays an important regulatory role in the occurrence and development of cancer. This study identified TIGAR as a potential regulator of ferroptosis resistance in the development of CRC. We showed that TIGAR expression in CRC tissues is significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues. Knockdown of TIGAR significantly caused an increase in erastin-induced ferroptosis in SW620 and HCT116 cells. Notably, knockdown of TIGAR significantly decreased GSH/GSSG ratio, increased lipid peroxidation production, and facilitated the accumulation of lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA), and rendered CRC cells more sensitive to erastin induced ferroptosis. Furthermore, TIGAR inhibition repressed SCD1 expression in a redox and AMPK-dependent manner. Thus, these results suggest that TIGAR induces ferroptosis resistance in CRC cells via the ROS/AMPK/SCD1 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The TRRAP transcription cofactor represses interferon-stimulated genes in colorectal cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35244540/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcription is essential for cells to respond to signaling cues and involves factors with multiple distinct activities. One such factor, TRRAP, functions as part of two large complexes, SAGA and TIP60, which have crucial roles during transcription activation. Structurally, TRRAP belongs to the phosphoinositide 3 kinase-related kinases (PIKK) family but is the only member classified as a pseudokinase. Recent studies established that a dedicated HSP90 co-chaperone, the triple T (TTT) complex, is essential for PIKK stabilization and activity. Here, using endogenous auxin-inducible degron alleles, we show that the TTT subunit TELO2 promotes TRRAP assembly into SAGA and TIP60 in human colorectal cancer cells (CRCs). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that TELO2 contributes to TRRAP regulatory roles in CRC cells, most notably of MYC target genes. Surprisingly, TELO2 and TRRAP depletion also induced the expression of type I interferon genes. Using a combination of nascent RNA, antibody-targeted chromatin profiling (CUT&amp;amp;RUN), ChIP, and kinetic analyses, we propose a model by which TRRAP directly represses the transcription of &lt;em&gt;IRF9&lt;/em&gt;, which encodes a master regulator of interferon-stimulated genes. We have therefore uncovered an unexpected transcriptional repressor role for TRRAP, which we propose contributes to its tumorigenic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A carcinoembryonic antigen-specific cell therapy selectively targets tumor cells with HLA loss of heterozygosity in vitro and in vivo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;CEACAM5&lt;/em&gt; gene product [carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)] is an attractive target for colorectal cancer because of its high expression in virtually all colorectal tumors and limited expression in most healthy adult tissues. However, highly active CEA-directed investigational therapeutics have been reported to be toxic, causing severe colitis because CEA is expressed on normal gut epithelial cells. Here, we developed a strategy to address this toxicity problem: the Tmod dual-signal integrator. CEA Tmod cells use two receptors: a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) activated by CEA and a leukocyte Ig-like receptor 1 (LIR-1)-based inhibitory receptor triggered by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A02. CEA Tmod cells exploit instances of HLA heterozygous gene loss in tumors to protect the patient from on-target, off-tumor toxicity. CEA Tmod cells potently killed CEA-expressing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. But in contrast to a traditional CEA-specific T cell receptor transgenic T cell, Tmod cells were highly selective for tumor cells even when mixed with HLA-A02-expressing cells. These data support further development of the CEA Tmod construct as a therapeutic candidate for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phosphorylated NFS1 weakens oxaliplatin-based chemosensitivity of colorectal cancer by preventing PANoptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35221331/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolic enzymes have an indispensable role in metabolic reprogramming, and their aberrant expression or activity has been associated with chemosensitivity. Hence, targeting metabolic enzymes remains an attractive approach for treating tumors. However, the influence and regulation of cysteine desulfurase (NFS1), a rate-limiting enzyme in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis, in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. Here, using an in vivo metabolic enzyme gene-based clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 library screen, we revealed that loss of NFS1 significantly enhanced the sensitivity of CRC cells to oxaliplatin. In vitro and in vivo results showed that NFS1 deficiency synergizing with oxaliplatin triggered PANoptosis (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis) by increasing the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, oxaliplatin-based oxidative stress enhanced the phosphorylation level of serine residues of NFS1, which prevented PANoptosis in an S293 phosphorylation-dependent manner during oxaliplatin treatment. In addition, high expression of NFS1, transcriptionally regulated by MYC, was found in tumor tissues and was associated with poor survival and hyposensitivity to chemotherapy in patients with CRC. Overall, the findings of this study provided insights into the underlying mechanisms of NFS1 in oxaliplatin sensitivity and identified NFS1 inhibition as a promising strategy for improving the outcome of platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A silica-based antioxidant nanoparticle for oral delivery of Camptothecin which reduces intestinal side effects while improving drug efficacy for colon cancer treatment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35235866/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camptothecin (CPT) is a potent anticancer agent for the treatment of colorectal cancer; however, it exhibits some limitations, including poor solubility, low stability, and low bioavailability via oral administration, which restrict its usability in clinical treatments. In addition, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during chemotherapy induces drug resistance and severe intestinal side effects. In this study, silica-installed ROS scavenging nanoparticles (siRNP) with 50-60 nm in diameter were employed to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of CPT. The solubility of CPT was significantly improved by incorporating it into the core of the nanoparticle, forming CPT-loaded siRNP (CPT@siRNP). The anticancer activity of CPT@siRNP against colorectal cancer cells (C-26) in vitro was significantly improved as compared to free CPT through higher efficiency of intracellular internalization and induction of apoptosis. Owing to its antioxidant properties, CPT@siRNP reduced cytotoxicity to normal endothelial cells, which was in sharp contrast to the high toxicity of free CPT. Oral administration of CPT and CPT@siRNP to the C-26 tumor-bearing mice exhibited antitumor activity, accompanied by effective suppression of tumor growth. Although CPT treatment suppressed tumor progression, it caused severe side effects, including intestinal damage and significant bodyweight loss. Interestingly, such noticeable side effects were not observed in the mice treated with CPT@siRNP, and the effect of tumor growth inhibition tended to be similar to or higher than that of CPT treatment. The results obtained in this study indicate that CPT@siRNP is a potential therapeutic nanomedicine for the treatment of colon cancer. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Here we employed silica-containing antioxidant nanoparticle (siRNP) as promising oral delivery nanocarrier of campothecin (CPT) to treat colon cancer. The design of siRNP via covalent conjugation of antioxidant nitroxide radicals and the silanol groups in the polymer backbone contributes to a significant increase in the absorption of hydrophobic drug molecules inside the core and enhances the stability of nanoparticles in the gastrointestinal environment for oral drug delivery. CPT-loaded siRNP (CPT@siRNP) significantly improved solubility of CPT. As compared to free CTP, the CPT@siRNP treatment showed a significantly higher toxicity to colon cancer cell, inhibition of cancer cell migration, and induction of apopotosis. With the antioxidant feature, siRNP also significantly suppressed the intestinal side effects caused by CPT treatment in tumor-bearing mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correction to: &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00284-022-02885-7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhubarb Alleviates Acute Lung Injury by Modulating Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis in Mice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intestinal microbiota disorders can aggravate pulmonary inflammation during acute lung injury (ALI). As a traditional Chinese herb, Rhubarb can regulated the gut microbiota. Therefore, this study was conducted to test the hypothesis that rhubarb alleviates gut microbiota dysbiosis and inflammation. Feces were collected from patients with ALI to detect the gut microbiota using 16S rDNA sequencing. Subsequently, a mouse model of ALI was established using lipopolysaccharide to investigate changes in the gut microbiota, the peripheral blood was attained for detecting the Th17/Treg cell ratio and the serum level of HDAC6 and HDAC9, and the effect of rhubarb treatment on the gut microbiota and Th17/Treg ratio were also evaluated. The results indicated that both the Firmicutes phylum decreased and the Bacteroidetes phylum increased were identified in patients with ALI, which induced the alternation of histone metabolites. The mice models also showed a similar imbalance in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio at phylum of level. Rhubarb treatment alleviated the damaged lung tissue, accelerated Alistipes, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus proliferation at the level of genus, increased the level of HDAC6 in both the mice lung tissue and serum, and markedly reduced the Treg cells and increased the Th17 cells in the spleen tissue. The study suggested that both patients and mouse models with ALI presented gut microbiota dysbiosis, and lead to a Th17/Treg cell imbalance in ALI mouse. Rhubarb promoted Alistipes, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus proliferation, increased the HDAC6 concentration, restored the Th17/Treg cell balance, and protected against ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Green Tea Extract to Prevent Colorectal Adenomas, Results of a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35213393/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Preclinical, epidemiological, and small clinical studies suggest that green tea extract (GTE) and its major active component epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) exhibit antineoplastic effects in the colorectum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A randomized, double-blind trial of GTE standardized to 150 mg of EGCG b.i.d. vs placebo over 3 years was conducted to prevent colorectal adenomas (n = 1,001 with colon adenomas enrolled, 40 German centers). Randomization (1:1, n = 879) was performed after a 4-week run-in with GTE for safety assessment. The primary end point was the presence of adenoma/colorectal cancer at the follow-up colonoscopy 3 years after randomization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The safety profile of GTE was favorable with no major differences in adverse events between the 2 well-balanced groups. Adenoma rate in the modified intention-to-treat set (all randomized participants [intention-to-treat population] and a follow-up colonoscopy 26-44 months after randomization; n = 632) was 55.7% in the placebo and 51.1% in the GTE groups. This 4.6% difference was not statistically significant (adjusted relative risk 0.905; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.1613). The respective figures for the per-protocol population were 54.3% (151/278) in the placebo group and 48.3% (129/267) in the GTE group, indicating a slightly lower adenoma rate in the GTE group, which was not significant (adjusted relative risk 0.883; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.1169).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt; GTE was well tolerated, but there was no statistically significant difference in the adenoma rate between the GTE and the placebo groups in the whole study population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Affimer Tagged Cubosomes: Targeting of Carcinoembryonic Antigen Expressing Colorectal Cancer Cells Using In Vitro and In Vivo Models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanomedicines, while having been approved for cancer therapy, present many challenges such as low stability, rapid clearance, and nonspecificity leading to off-target toxicity. Cubosomes are porous lyotropic liquid crystalline nanoparticles that have shown great premise as drug delivery vehicles; however, their behavior &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; is largely underexplored, hindering clinical translation. Here, we have engineered cubosomes based on the space group &lt;em&gt;Im3m&lt;/em&gt; that are loaded with copper acetylacetonate as a model drug, and their surfaces are functionalized for the first time with Affimer proteins via copper-free click chemistry to actively target overexpressed carcinoembryonic antigens on LS174T colorectal cancer cells. Unlike nontargeted cubosomes, Affimer tagged cubosomes showed preferential accumulation in cancer cells compared to normal cells not only &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; (2D monolayer cell culture and 3D spheroid models) but also &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; in colorectal cancer mouse xenografts, while exhibiting low nonspecific absorption and toxicity in other vital organs. Cancerous spheroids had maximum cell death compared to noncancerous cells upon targeted delivery. Xenografts subjected to targeted drug-loaded cubosomes showed a 5-7-fold higher drug accumulation in the tumor tissue compared to the liver, kidneys, and other vital organs, a significant decrease in tumor growth, and an increased survival rate compared to the nontargeted group. This work encompasses the first thorough preclinical investigation of Affimer targeted cubosomes as a cancer therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cucurbitacin E Triggers Cellular Senescence in Colon Cancer Cells via Regulating the miR-371b-5p/TFAP4 Signaling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35192356/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The induction of cellular senescence is considered as a potent strategy to suppress cancer progression. Cucurbitacin E (CE) belongs to the triterpenoids and has received substantial attention for its antineoplastic property. However, the function of CE on cellular senescence remained elusive. Herein, we revealed that CE significantly induced cellular senescence in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The CE effects on the cellular senescence in CRC cells were confirmed by observing the common features of the senescence, such as the enhanced activity of senescence-associated β-galactosidase, γ-H2AX positive staining, and upregulation of senescence-associated proteins including p53, p27, and p21. Moreover, CE exerted pro-senescent effects in CRC cells via attenuating the transcription factor activating enhancer-binding protein 4 (TFAP4) expression, and the ectopic expression of TFAP4 blocked the CE-induced senescence. Mechanistically, CE treatment caused a robust increase in miR-371b-5p, which markedly repressed TFAP4. In contrast, silencing of miR-371b-5p counteracted the percentages of CE-induced senescent cells from 37.49 ± 2.61 to 7.06 ± 0.91% in HCT-116 cells via derepressing TFAP4 to attenuate the expression of p53, p21, and p16. Altogether, these results demonstrated that dietary CE induces CRC cellular senescence via modulating the miR-371b-5p/TFAP4 axis and presents opportunities for potential therapeutic strategies against CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BCL-XL inhibition induces an FGFR4-mediated rescue response in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35172148/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FGFR4 inhibition sensitizes CRC cells to BCL-XL inhibition and spares normal cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BCL-XL targeting BH3 mimetics induce FGF2-mediated FGFR4 pathway activation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FGFR4 activation in CRC cells can induce apoptosis resistance by upregulating MCL-1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heterogeneous therapy response observed in colorectal cancer is in part due to cancer stem cells (CSCs) that resist chemotherapeutic insults. The anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL plays a critical role in protecting CSCs from cell death, where its inhibition with high doses of BH3 mimetics can induce apoptosis. Here, we screen a compound library for synergy with low-dose BCL-XL inhibitor A-1155463 to identify pathways that regulate sensitivity to BCL-XL inhibition and reveal that fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)4 inhibition effectively sensitizes to A-1155463 both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we identify a rescue response that is activated upon BCL-XL inhibition and leads to rapid FGF2 secretion and subsequent FGFR4-mediated post-translational stabilization of MCL-1. FGFR4 inhibition prevents MCL-1 upregulation and thereby sensitizes CSCs to BCL-XL inhibition. Altogether, our findings suggest a cell transferable induction of a FGF2/FGFR4 rescue response in CRC that is induced upon BCL-XL inhibition and leads to MCL-1 upregulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Substrate rigidity dictates colorectal tumorigenic cell stemness and metastasis via CRAD-dependent mechanotransduction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35172140/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRAD is reduced in colorectal tumorigenic cells responding to substrate rigidity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRAD inhibits CRC stemness by regulating YAP transcriptional co-repressor activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRAD-dependent mechanical signaling dictates CRC metastasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRAD-F-actin-YAP axis regulates CRC progression in vivo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor physical microenvironment contributes greatly to the response of tumor cells. However, the mechanism of how extracellular substrate rigidity remodels colorectal cancer (CRC) cell fate and affects CRC progression remains elusive. Here, we show that F-actin regulator KIAA1211, also known as Capping protein inhibiting regulator of actin dynamics (CRAD), negatively correlates with CRC progression, stemness, and metastasis. Mechanistically, decreased CRAD in soft substrates induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) retention in the cytoplasm, restoring the repression effect on stemness markers NANOG and OCT4, thereby promoting CRC stemness and metastasis. Furthermore, CRAD deficiency promotes colorectal tumor cell softening and regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) states, contributing to its metastasis potential. Clinically, CRAD expression is correlated with malignant degrees and metastasis in CRC patients. Our work uncovers a role of CRAD in anticancer and mechanical signal transduction of the extracellular matrix in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomal circLPAR1 functions in colorectal cancer diagnosis and tumorigenesis through suppressing BRD4 via METTL3-eIF3h interaction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35164758/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Exosomes have emerged as vital biomarkers of multiple cancers and contain abundant circular RNAs (circRNAs). However, the potential for exosomal circRNAs to be used in diagnostics and their molecular mechanism of action in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; CRC-specific exosomal circRNAs were identified by RNA sequencing, exoRBase database and a tissue microarray. The diagnostic performance of plasma exosomal circRNAs was evaluated among cancer-free controls, precancer individuals, CRC patients, and patients with other types of cancer. The corresponding biological functions were mainly assessed using circRNA pull-down, proteomic analysis, and RNA immunoprecipitation assay underlying cellular and mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CircLPAR1 was encapsulated in exosomes with high stability and detectability, and its expression in plasma exosomes was remarkably decreased during CRC development but recovered after surgery. Exosomal circLPAR1 showed cancer specificity in CRC diagnosis and increased the diagnostic performance to an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.875, as determined by analysing its performance in combination with common clinical biomarkers CEA and CA19-9. Additionally, circLPAR1 was downregulated in CRC tissues and was associated with overall survival. Mechanistically, exosomal circLPAR1 was internalized by CRC cells, and it suppressed tumor growth, likely because exosomal circLPAR1 directly bound with eIF3h specifically suppressed the METTL3-eIF3h interaction, decreasing the translation of oncogene BRD4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This comprehensive study highlights plasma exosomal circLPAR1 as a promising predictor in CRC diagnosis and describes its biological regulation of colorectal tumorigenesis. This study provides a new perspective on early diagnosis in the clinic and pathogenesis in disease development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of bile acids and their receptors in gastrointestinal and hepatic pathophysiology</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35165436/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bile acids (BAs) can regulate their own metabolism and transport as well as other key aspects of metabolic homeostasis via dedicated (nuclear and G protein-coupled) receptors. Disrupted BA transport and homeostasis results in the development of cholestatic disorders and contributes to a wide range of liver diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, impaired BA homeostasis can also affect the intestine, contributing to the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal and oesophageal cancer. Here, we provide a summary of the role of BAs and their disrupted homeostasis in the development of gastrointestinal and hepatic disorders and present novel insights on how targeting BA pathways might contribute to novel treatment strategies for these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal butyrate-metabolizing species contribute to autoantibody production and bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35148177/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imbalance between pathogenic and beneficial species of the intestinal microbiome and metabolism in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unclarified. Here, using shotgun-based metagenome sequencing for a treatment-naïve patient cohort and a &amp;ldquo;quasi-paired cohort&amp;rdquo; method, we observed a deficiency of butyrate-producing species and an overwhelming number of butyrate consumers in RA patients. These outcomes mainly occurred in patients with positive ACPA, with a mean AUC of 0.94. This panel was also validated in established RA with an AUC of 0.986 in those with joint deformity. In addition, we showed that butyrate promoted T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt;, while suppressing T&lt;sub&gt;convs&lt;/sub&gt; and osteoclasts, due to potentiation of the reduction in HDAC expression and down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine genes. Dietary butyrate supplementation conferred anti-inflammatory benefits in a mouse model by rebalancing T&lt;sub&gt;FH&lt;/sub&gt; cells and T&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as reducing antibody production. These findings reveal the critical role of butyrate-metabolizing species and suggest the potential of butyrate-based therapies for RA patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long noncoding RNA Gm31629 protects against mucosal damage in experimental colitis via YB-1/E2F pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35143419/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mucosal healing is a key treatment goal for inflammatory bowel disease, and adequate epithelial regeneration is required for an intact gut epithelium. However, the underlying mechanism for mucosal healing is unclear. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be involved in the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we report that a lncRNA named Gm31629 decreased in intestinal epithelial cells in response to inflammatory stimulation. Gm31629 deficiency led to exacerbated intestinal inflammation and delayed epithelial regeneration in dextran sulfate sodium-induced (DSS-induced) colitis model. Mechanistically, Gm31629 promoted E2F pathways and cell proliferation by stabilizing Y-box protein 1 (YB-1), thus facilitating epithelial regeneration. Genetic overexpression of Gm31629 protected against DSS-induced colitis in vivo. Theaflavin 3-gallate, a natural compound mimicking Gm31629, alleviated DSS-induced epithelial inflammation and mucosal damage. These results demonstrate an essential role of lncRNA Gm31629 in linking intestinal inflammation and epithelial cell proliferation, providing a potential therapeutic approach to inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DAB2IP suppresses tumor malignancy by inhibiting GRP75-driven p53 ubiquitination in colon cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35150809/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35150809/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAB2IP expression correlates with better prognosis in colorectal cancers with WT p53.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAB2IP prolongs the half-life of wild-type p53 and activates p53 signaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAB2IP inhibits p53 ubiquitination by competitively antagonizing the GRP75 protein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAB2IP regulates p53 by interacting with GRP75 via the Ras-GAP domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence has shown that DAB2IP acts as a tumor suppressor and plays an inhibitory role in many signals associated with tumorigenesis. However, the underlying mechanism of this function remains unclear. Our study shows that DAB2IP was positively associated with a good prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer and wild-type p53 expression. An in vitro assay showed that DAB2IP elicited potent tumor-suppressive effects by inhibiting cell invasiveness and colony formation and promoting cell apoptosis in wild-type p53 colon cancer cells. In addition, DAB2IP improved the stability of wild-type p53 by inhibiting its degradation in a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner. Using mass spectrometry profiling, we revealed that DAB2IP and p53 interacted with the ubiquitin ligase-related protein GRP75. Mechanistically, DAB2IP is competitively bound to GRP75, thus reducing GRP75-driven p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, the Ras-GAP domain was required for the DAB2IP-GRP75 interaction and DAB2IP-mediated p53 ubiquitination. Finally, animal experiments revealed that DAB2IP inhibited tumor progression in vivo. In conclusion, our study presents a novel function of DAB2IP in GRP75-driven wild-type p53 degradation, providing new insight into DAB2IP-induced tumor suppression and a novel molecular interpretation of the p53 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Asia-specific variant of human IgG1 represses colorectal tumorigenesis by shaping the tumor microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35133976/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging studies have focused on ways to treat cancers by modulating T cell activation. However, whether B cell receptor signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can be harnessed for immunotherapy is unclear. Here, we report that an Asia-specific variant of human IgG1 containing a Gly396 to Arg396 substitution (hIgG1-G396R) conferred improved survival of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Mice with knockin of the murine functional homolog mIgG2c-G400R recapitulated the alleviated tumorigenesis and progression in murine colon carcinoma models. Immune profiling of the TME revealed broad mobilizations of IgG1+ plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD103+ DCs, and active tertiary lymphoid structure formation, suggesting an effective antitumor microenvironment in hIgG1-G396R CRC patients. Mechanistically, this variant potentiated tumor-associated antigen-specific (TAA-specific) plasma cell differentiation and thus antibody production. These elevated TAA-specific IgG2c antibodies in turn efficiently boosted the antibody-dependent tumor cell phagocytosis and TAA presentation to effector CD8+ T cells. Notably, adoptive transfer of TAA-specific class-switched memory B cells harboring this variant exhibited therapeutic efficacy in murine tumor models, indicating their clinical potential. All these results prompted a prospective investigation of hIgG1-G396R in patients with CRC as a biomarker for clinical prognosis and demonstrated that manipulating the functionality of IgG1+ memory B cells in tumors could improve immunotherapy outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>YAP derived circ-LECRC functions as a &#34;brake signal&#34; to suppress hyperactivation of oncogenic YAP signalling in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35131381/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our study firstly reported a specific circRNA transcript variant in colorectal cancer which is derived from YAP1 gene locus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circ-LECRC could inhibit colorectal tumour growth and lung metastasis in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circ-LECRC could indirectly upregulating the expression of KLF4 through competitively binding miR-135 b-5p.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circ-LECRC served as a “brake signal” to hinder the hyperactivation of YAP1 signalling via circ-LECRC/miR-135b-5p/KLF4 axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital roles in tumorigenesis by modulating gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of circRNAs remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that a Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1)-derived circRNA, circ-LECRC (circRNA low expressed in CRC), was significantly downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC). High expression of circ-LECRC positively correlated with a lower TNM stage and good prognosis in CRC patients. Circ-LECRC overexpression significantly inhibited CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and promoted apoptosis (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Additionally, we performed xenograft and lung metastasis experiments by injecting CRC cells into nude mice to mechanistically demonstrate that circ-LECRC directly binds to miR-135b-5p and relieve the suppression of its target, Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). Furthermore, we found that both circ-LECRC and KLF4 inhibited YAP1 hyperactivation, which downregulates the expression of the downstream genes of the YAP1 pathway, such as EGFR, MYC, BIRC5, and CTGF. In summary, circ-LECRC regulates KLF4 expression by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA and serves as a &amp;ldquo;brake signal&amp;rdquo; to suppress hyperactivation of oncogenic YAP signalling, leading to tumour growth inhibition in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Presence of Tim3&#43; and PD-1&#43; CD8&#43; T cells identifies microsatellite stable colorectal carcinomas with immune exhaustion and distinct clinicopathological features</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35119692/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. CRC is stratified into two major groups: microsatellite stable (MSS) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). MSS CRC constitutes the majority of cases, has worse overall prognosis, and thus far has failed to respond to immunotherapies targeting the immune checkpoint receptors PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4. Here we examined the alternate immunotherapy targets Tim-3 and Lag-3, as well as PD-1, on immune cells in a cohort of MSS CRC using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry together with mutational analysis and clinical data. We found that PD-1 was variably expressed across CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) subtypes, and Tim-3 was mostly restricted to CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; regulatory T cells. Lag-3, when detected by flow cytometry, was largely coexpressed with Tim-3 and PD-1 in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; TILs. Furthermore, Tim-3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; PD-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; TILs accumulated in the tumor and exhibited a dysfunctional or &amp;rsquo;exhausted&amp;rsquo; phenotype. Notably, we observed a subset of patients with a high proportion of Tim-3&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; PD-1&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; TILs and, conversely, a low proportion of Tim-3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; PD-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; TILs, thus stratifying MSS CRC patients based on a feature of immune exhaustion (MSS-ImmEx). MSS-ImmExhi patients had abundant Tim-3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; PD-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; TILs, PD-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; effector, and regulatory T cells, and were enriched for left-sided colon tumors and mutations in the APC tumor-suppressor gene. We further investigated the spatial organization of Tim-3, Lag-3, PD-1, and PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry and found higher levels in the tumor margin; however, MSS-ImmExhi tumors exhibited a higher density of Tim-3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the tumor center over MSS-ImmExlow tumors. Immunofluorescence revealed a higher density of PD-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the tumor center in this group. Our findings identify a subset of MSS CRC that exhibits evidence of higher prior immune activation (MSS-ImmExhi ) in which therapies targeting Tim-3 in conjunction with anti-PD-1 or other immunotherapies may provide clinical benefit. © 2022 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of Nutrient-sensing Receptor GPRC6A in Regulating Colonic Group 3 Innate Lymphoid Cells and Inflamed Mucosal Healing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35134872/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Group 3 innate lymphoid cells [ILC3s] sense environmental signals and are critical in gut homeostasis and immune defence. G-protein-coupled receptors [GPCRs] mediate cellular responses to diverse environmental signals. However, the GPCRs&amp;rsquo; regulation mechanisms of ILC3s is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used wild-type [WT] and &lt;em&gt;GPRC6A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice to investigate the role of GPRC6A in the population and the function of ILC3s. We then purified ILC3s from WT and &lt;em&gt;GPRC6A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Colitis was induced in WT mice and &lt;em&gt;GPRC6A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice through dextran sodium sulphate [DSS] administration or &lt;em&gt;C. rodentium&lt;/em&gt; infection. Furthermore L-arginine, a selective GPRC6A agonist, was administered to mice with colitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that colonic ILC3s expressed GPRC6A. The deficiency of GPRC6A decreased ILC3-derived interleukin-22 [IL-22] production and the number of proliferating ILC3s, which led to increased susceptibility to colon injury and pathogen infection and impaired inflamed mucosal healing. Further studies showed that L-arginine, a GPRC6A agonist, promoted colonic ILC3 expansion and function via the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 [mTORC1] signalling &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, L-arginine attenuated DSS-induced colitis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. This was associated with a significant increase in IL-22 secretion by ILC3s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings unveil a role for the nutrient-sensing receptor GPRC6A in colonic ILC3 function and identify a novel ILC3 receptor signalling pathway modulating inflamed mucosal healing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aspirin activates resolution pathways to reprogram T cell and macrophage responses in colitis-associated colorectal cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is linked with carcinogenesis in many types of cancer including colorectal cancer (CRC). Aspirin is recommended for the prevention of CRC, although the mechanism(s) mediating its immunomodulatory actions remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that aspirin increased concentrations of the immune-regulatory aspirin-triggered specialized proresolving mediators (AT-SPMs), including AT-lipoxin A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and AT-resolvin D1, in colonic tissues during inflammation-associated CRC (I-CRC). Aspirin also down-regulated the expression of the checkpoint protein programmed cell death protein-1 in macrophages and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells from the colonic mucosa. Inhibition of AT-SPM biosynthesis or knockout of the AT-SPM receptor &lt;em&gt;Alx/Fpr2&lt;/em&gt; reversed the immunomodulatory actions of aspirin on macrophages and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and abrogated its protective effects during I-CRC. Furthermore, treatment of mice with AT-SPM recapitulated the immune-directed actions of aspirin during I-CRC. Together, these findings elucidate a central role for AT-SPM in mediating the immune-directed actions of aspirin in regulating I-CRC progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>E3 ligase RNF167 and deubiquitinase STAMBPL1 modulate mTOR and cancer progression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35114100/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RNF167 and STAMBPL1 modulate Sestrin2 ubiquitination in response to leucine status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubiquitinated Sestrin2 inhibits mTORC1 activity by sequestering GATOR2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppression of STAMBPL1 function inhibits tumor growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STAMBPL1 is a potential therapeutic target in colorectal cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is an essential metabolic hub that coordinates cellular metabolism with the availability of nutrients, including amino acids. Sestrin2 has been identified as a cytosolic leucine sensor that transmits leucine status signals to mTORC1. In this study, we identify an E3 ubiquitin ligase RING finger protein 167 (RNF167) and a deubiquitinase STAMBPL1 that function in concert to control the polyubiquitination level of Sestrin2 in response to leucine availability. Ubiquitination of Sestrin2 promotes its interaction with GATOR2 and inhibits mTORC1 signaling. Bioinformatic analysis reveals decreased RNF167 expression and increased STAMBPL1 expression in gastric and colorectal tumors. Knockout of STAMBPL1 or correction of the heterozygous STAMBPL1 mutation in a human colon cancer cell line suppresses xenograft tumor growth. Lastly, a cell-permeable peptide that blocks the STAMBPL1-Sestrin2 interaction inhibits mTORC1 and provides a potential option for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KIAA1199 drives immune suppression to promote colorectal cancer liver metastasis by modulating neutrophil infiltration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35108400/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer mortality, and colorectal cancer (CRC) frequently metastasizes to the liver. Our previous studies demonstrated the critical role of KIAA1199 in tumor invasion and metastasis in CRC. In the present study, we described an immune regulatory effect of KIAA1199 that creates a permissive environment for metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt; Flow cytometry was used to examine the effects of KIAA1199 on the infiltration of tumor immune cells. Neutrophils and T cells were isolated, stimulated, and/or cultured for in vitro function assays. In the patients with CRC, high expression levels of KIAA1199 were associated with an increased neutrophil infiltration into the liver. This result was further validated in mouse metastasis models. The increased influx of neutrophils contributed to the KIAA1199-driven CRC liver metastasis. Mechanistically, KIAA1199 activated the TGFβ signaling pathway by interacting with the TGFBR1/2 to stimulate CXCL1 and CXCL3 production, thereby driving the aggregation of immunosuppressive neutrophils. Genetic blockade or pharmacologic inhibition of KIAA1199 restored tumor immune infiltration, impeded tumor progression, and potentiated response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings indicated that KIAA1199 could facilitate the liver infiltration of immunosuppressive neutrophils via the TGFβ-chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)3/1-CXCR2 axis, which might be clinically targeted for the treatment of hepatic metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liquidambaric acid inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling and colon cancer via targeting TNF receptor-associated factor 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TRAF2 is a positive regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in colon cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidambaric acid (LDA) inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling via targeting TRAF2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A TRAF2/β-catenin/TCF4/TNIK complex is present in colon cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDA disrupts the TRAF2/β-catenin/TCF4 complex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a well-established driver of colon cancer; however, a targeted therapeutic agent has not reached clinics yet. In the present study, we report that the natural compound liquidambaric acid (LDA) inhibits oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo through its direct target tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). Mechanistically, TRAF2 positively regulates Wnt signaling by interacting with the N-terminal of β-catenin via its TRAF-C domain; this interaction is disrupted in presence of LDA. Particularly, a TRAF2/β-catenin/TCF4/TNIK complex is present in colon cancer cells, where TRAF2 is indispensable for the complex formation, and TRAF2/β-catenin and β-catenin/TCF4 interactions are disrupted upon LDA treatment. Our findings not only highlight that TRAF2 is an oncogenic regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and colon cancer but also provide a lead compound targeting TRAF2 for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>m6A modifications regulate intestinal immunity and rotavirus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35098923/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant mRNA modification and affects many biological processes. However, how m6A levels are regulated during physiological or pathological processes such as virus infections, and the in vivo function of m6A in the intestinal immune defense against virus infections are largely unknown. Here, we uncover a novel antiviral function of m6A modification during rotavirus (RV) infection in small bowel intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). We found that rotavirus infection induced global m6A modifications on mRNA transcripts by down-regulating the m6a eraser ALKBH5. Mice lacking the m6A writer enzymes METTL3 in IECs (&lt;em&gt;Mettl3&lt;/em&gt;ΔIEC) were resistant to RV infection and showed increased expression of interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Using RNA-sequencing and m6A RNA immuno-precipitation (RIP)-sequencing, we identified IRF7, a master regulator of IFN responses, as one of the primary m6A targets during virus infection. In the absence of METTL3, IECs showed increased &lt;em&gt;Irf7&lt;/em&gt; mRNA stability and enhanced type I and III IFN expression. Deficiency in IRF7 attenuated the elevated expression of IFNs and ISGs and restored susceptibility to RV infection in &lt;em&gt;Mettl3&lt;/em&gt;ΔIEC mice. Moreover, the global m6A modification on mRNA transcripts declined with age in mice, with a significant drop from 2 weeks to 3 weeks post birth, which likely has broad implications for the development of intestinal immune system against enteric viruses early in life. Collectively, we demonstrated a novel host m6A-IRF7-IFN antiviral signaling cascade that restricts rotavirus infection &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cancer-associated fibroblasts at the unfavorable desmoplastic stroma promote colorectal cancer aggressiveness: Potential role of ADAM9</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35080810/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumor microenvironment plays a key role in cancer aggressiveness. Desmoplastic reaction (DR), morphologically classified as Mature, Intermediate and Immature types, has previously been shown to be highly prognostic in colorectal cancer (CRC) and it consists to a large extent of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The aim of our study was to characterize the molecular background of DR and understand the effects of CAFs in tumor aggressiveness. The prognostic significance of DR was initially examined in 1497 patients. Then CAFs originating from patient tissues with different DR types were isolated and their impact on tumor growth was examined both in vitro and in vivo. DR was shown to be highly prognostic, with patients within the Immature DR group conferring the worst relapse-free survival. The conditioned media of CAFs from tumor with Immature-type DR (CAFs&lt;sup&gt;Immature&lt;/sup&gt;) significantly increased proliferation and migration of CRC cell lines and growth of CRC-derived organoids compared to that of CAFs from Mature-type DR (CAFs&lt;sup&gt;Mature&lt;/sup&gt;). Subcutaneous or orthotopic implantation of CRC cells together with CAFs&lt;sup&gt;Immature&lt;/sup&gt; in mice significantly promoted tumor growth and dissemination compared to implantation with CAFsMature . Systematic examination of the expression of &amp;ldquo;a disintegrin and metalloproteinases&amp;rdquo; (ADAMs) in CAFs isolated from CRC tissues showed that the secreted isoform of ADAM9 (ADAM9s) was significantly higher in CAFs&lt;sup&gt;Immature&lt;/sup&gt; than in CAFsMature . Knockdown of ADAM9s in CAFsImmature abrogated the promoting effects on CRC cell proliferation and migration. CAFs-derived ADAM9s is implicated in deteriorating survival in CRC patients with Immature-type DR by increasing tumor cell proliferation and dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Localized Degradation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps by Photoregulated Enzyme Delivery for Cancer Immunotherapy and Metastasis Suppression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35080858/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extrusion of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a fundamental host innate immune defense against pathogens, has recently been linked to cancer resistance to immunotherapy and distant metastasis. These findings highlight interesting areas of cancer-elicited inflammation and potential therapeutic strategies. Disrupting existing NETs with DNase I has been proved to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of tumor immunotherapy and attenuate metastatic spread. However, systemic biodistribution of DNase I raises safety issues, potentially impairing host defense against infection. Hence, tumor-specific delivery and metastatic niche-targeted effects are attractive options for localized degradation of NETs. We have engineered a nanoplatform with a plasmonic gold blackbody (AuPB) core with broad-spectrum photo activity and a mesoporous polydopamine (mPDA) shell for efficient loading and photoregulated release of DNase I. The on-demand released DNase I triggered by the second near-infrared (NIR-II) light irradiation breaks the &amp;ldquo;NET-mediated physical barrier&amp;rdquo;, thereby increasing the contact of immune cytotoxic cells with tumor cells in living mice and sensitizing immune checkpoint therapy of primary colorectal cancer (CRC). Moreover, the deposition and light-controlled cargo release from systemically delivered AuPB@mPDA carriers in liver, the most frequent site of CRC metastasis, abolished NET-mediated capture of circulating tumor cells and hence metastatic seeding. Our findings indicate that the localized, light-regulated release of DNase I by photoactive carriers in the NIR-II window represent a translational route for immune-mediated tumor regression and metastasis inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Berberine Relieves Metabolic Syndrome in Mice by Inhibiting Liver Inflammation Caused by a High-Fat Diet and Potential Association With Gut Microbiota</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35095784/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether berberine mediates its anti-inflammatory and blood sugar and lipid-lowering effects solely by adjusting the structure of the gut microbiota or by first directly regulating the expression of host pro-inflammatory proteins and activation of macrophages and subsequently acting on gut microbiota, is currently unclear. To clarify the mechanism of berberine-mediated regulation of metabolism, we constructed an obese mouse model using SPF-grade C57BL/6J male mice and conducted a systematic study of liver tissue pathology, inflammatory factor expression, and gut microbiota structure. We screened the gut microbiota targets of berberine and showed that the molecular mechanism of berberine-mediated treatment of metabolic syndrome involves the regulation of gut microbiota structure and the expression of inflammatory factors. Our results revealed that a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly changed mice gut microbiota, thereby probably increasing the level of toxins in the intestine, and triggered the host inflammatory response. The HFD also reduced the proportion of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing genes, thereby hindering mucosal immunity and cell nutrition, and increased the host inflammatory response and liver fat metabolism disorders. Further, berberine could improve the chronic HFD-induced inflammatory metabolic syndrome to some extent and effectively improved the metabolism of high-fat foods in mice, which correlated with the gut microbiota composition. Taken together, our study may improve our understanding of host-microbe interactions during the treatment of metabolic diseases and provide useful insights into the action mechanism of berberine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maternal regulation of biliary disease in neonates via gut microbial metabolites</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35013245/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maternal seeding of the microbiome in neonates promotes a long-lasting biological footprint, but how it impacts disease susceptibility in early life remains unknown. We hypothesized that feeding butyrate to pregnant mice influences the newborn&amp;rsquo;s susceptibility to biliary atresia, a severe cholangiopathy of neonates. Here, we show that butyrate administration to mothers renders newborn mice resistant to inflammation and injury of bile ducts and improves survival. The prevention of hepatic immune cell activation and survival trait is linked to fecal signatures of Bacteroidetes and Clostridia and increases glutamate/glutamine and hypoxanthine in stool metabolites of newborn mice. In human neonates with biliary atresia, the fecal microbiome signature of these bacteria is under-represented, with suppression of glutamate/glutamine and increased hypoxanthine pathways. The direct administration of butyrate or glutamine to newborn mice attenuates the disease phenotype, but only glutamine renders bile duct epithelial cells resistant to cytotoxicity by natural killer cells. Thus, maternal intake of butyrate influences the fecal microbial population and metabolites in newborn mice and the phenotypic expression of experimental biliary atresia, with glutamine promoting survival of bile duct epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations in gut microbiota can be explained by animal host characteristics, including host phylogeny and diet. However, there are currently no databases that allow for easy exploration of the relationship between gut microbiota and diverse animal hosts. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://leb.snu.ac.kr/amdb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Animal Microbiome Database (AMDB)&lt;/a&gt; is the first database to provide taxonomic profiles of the gut microbiota in various animal species. &lt;a href=&#34;http://leb.snu.ac.kr/amdb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AMDB&lt;/a&gt; contains 2530 amplicon data from 34 projects with manually curated metadata. The total data represent 467 animal species and contain 10 478 bacterial taxa. This novel database provides information regarding gut microbiota structures and the distribution of gut bacteria in animals, with an easy-to-use interface.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bio-annotation.cn/gutmgene&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gutMGene&lt;/a&gt;, a manually curated database, aims at providing a comprehensive resource of target genes of gut microbes and microbial metabolites in humans and mice. Metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples has identified 3.3 × 106 non-redundant microbial genes from up to 1500 different species. One of the contributions of gut microbiota to host biology is the circulating pool of bacterially derived small-molecule metabolites. It has been estimated that 10% of metabolites found in mammalian blood are derived from the gut microbiota, where they can produce systemic effects on the host through activating or inhibiting gene expression. The current version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://bio-annotation.cn/gutmgene&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gutMGene&lt;/a&gt; documents 1331 curated relationships between 332 gut microbes, 207 microbial metabolites and 223 genes in humans, and 2349 curated relationships between 209 gut microbes, 149 microbial metabolites and 544 genes in mice. Each entry in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bio-annotation.cn/gutmgene&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gutMGene&lt;/a&gt; contains detailed information on a relationship between gut microbe, microbial metabolite and target gene, a brief description of the relationship, experiment technology and platform, literature reference and so on. &lt;a href=&#34;http://bio-annotation.cn/gutmgene&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gutMGene&lt;/a&gt; provides a user-friendly interface to browse and retrieve each entry using gut microbes, disorders and intervention measures. It also offers the option to download all the entries and submit new experimentally validated associations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TRIB3 reduces CD8&#43; T cell infiltration and induces immune evasion by repressing the STAT1-CXCL10 axis in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34985967/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell infiltration in colorectal cancer (CRC) should suggest a favorable prognosis and a satisfactory response to immunotherapy; however, the vast majority of patients with CRC do not benefit from immunotherapy due to poor T cell infiltration. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms for T cell exclusion from CRC tumors is needed. Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) has been implicated as an oncoprotein, but its role in regulating antitumor immune responses has not been defined. Here, we demonstrated that TRIB3 inhibits CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell infiltration in various CRC mouse models. We showed that TRIB3 was acetylated by acetyltransferase P300, which inhibited ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of TRIB3. Ectopically expressed TRIB3 inhibited signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) activation and STAT1-mediated CXCL10 transcription by enhancing the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, causing a reduction in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Genetic ablation of Trib3 or pharmacological acceleration of TRIB3 degradation with a P300 inhibitor increased T cell recruitment and sensitized CRCs to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. These findings identified TRIB3 as a negative modulator of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell infiltration in CRCs, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for treating immunologically “cold” CRCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Claudin-2 promotes colorectal cancer growth and metastasis by suppressing NDRG1 transcription</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34965023/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumours, with multiple driving factors and biological transitions involved in its development. Claudin-2 (CLDN2), a well-defined component of cellular tight junction, has been indicated to associate with CRC progression. However, the function of CLDN2 and the underlying mechanism whereby the downstream signalling transduction is regulated in CRC remains largely unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that CLDN2 is upregulated in CRC samples and associated with poor survival. And CLDN2 depletion significantly promotes N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) transcription, leading to termination of the CRC growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, this process promotes CLDN2/ZO1/ZONAB complex dissociation and ZONAB shuttle into nucleus to enrich in the promoter of NDRG1. Thus, this study reveals a novel CLDN2/ZO1/ZONAB-NDRG1 axis in CRC by regulating the expression of EMT-related genes and CDKIs, suggesting CLDN2 may serve as a promising target for CRC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TNF-α Induces Neutrophil Apoptosis Delay and Promotes Intestinal Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Lung Injury through Activating JNK/FoxO3a Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35003520/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Intestinal ischemia is a common clinical critical illness. Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IIR) leads to acute lung injury (ALI), but the causative factors of ALI are unknown. The aim of this study was to reveal the causative factors and mechanisms of IIR-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A mouse model of IIR was developed using C57BL/6 mice, followed by detection of lung injury status and plasma levels of inflammatory factors in sham-operated mice and model mice. Some model mice were treated with a tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor lenalidomide (10 mg/kg), followed by observation of lung injury status through hematoxylin and eosin staining and detection of neutrophil infiltration levels through naphthol esterase and Ly6G immunohistochemical staining. Additionally, peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were cultured &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and then stimulated by TNF-α to mimic &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; inflammatory stimuli; this TNF-α stimulation was also performed on PMNs after knockdown of FoxO3a or treatment with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. PMN apoptosis after stimulation was detected using flow cytometry. Finally, the role of PMN apoptosis in IIR-induced lung injury was evaluated in vivo by detecting the ALI status in the model mice administered with ABT-199, a Bcl-2 inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; IIR led to pulmonary histopathological injury and increased lung water content, which were accompanied by increased plasma levels of inflammatory factors, with the TNF-α plasma level showing the most pronounced increase. Inhibition of TNF-α led to effective reduction of lung tissue injury, especially that of the damaging infiltration of PMNs in the lung. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; knockdown of FoxO3a or inhibition of JNK activity could inhibit TNF-α-induced PMN apoptosis. Further &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments revealed that ABT-199 effectively alleviated lung injury and decreased inflammation levels by promoting PMN apoptosis during IIR-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; TNF-α activates the JNK/FoxO3a pathway to induce a delay in PMN apoptosis, which promotes IIR-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N6-Methyladenosine Reader YTHDF1 Promotes ARHGEF2 Translation and RhoA Signaling in Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34968454/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34968454/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; N6-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) governs the fate of RNAs through m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A readers. Colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits aberrant m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modifications and expression of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A regulators. However, how m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A readers interpret oncogenic m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylome to promote malignant transformation remains to be illustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (Ythdf1) knockout mouse was generated to determine the effect of Ythdf1 in CRC tumorigenesis in vivo. Multiomic analysis of RNA-sequencing, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;AA methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, YTHDF1 RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, and proteomics were performed to unravel targets of YTHDF1 in CRC. The therapeutic potential of targeting YTHDF1-m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (ARHGEF2) was evaluated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) encapsulated by lipid nanoparticles (LNP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; DNA copy number gain of YTHDF1 is a frequent event in CRC and contributes to its overexpression. High expression of YTHDF1 is significantly associated with metastatic gene signature in patient tumors. Ythdf1 knockout in mice dampened tumor growth in an inflammatory CRC model. YTHDF1 promotes cell growth in CRC cell lines and primary organoids and lung and liver metastasis in vivo. Integrative multiomics analysis identified RhoA activator ARHGEF2 as a key downstream target of YTHDF1. YTHDF1 binds to m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A sites of ARHGEF2 messenger RNA, resulting in enhanced translation of ARHGEF2. Ectopic expression of ARHGEF2 restored impaired RhoA signaling, cell growth, and metastatic ability both in vitro and in vivo caused by YTHDF1 loss, verifying that ARHGEF2 is a key target of YTHDF1. Finally, ARHGEF2 siRNA delivered by LNP significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We identify a novel oncogenic epitranscriptome axis of YTHDF1-m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-ARHGEF2, which regulates CRC tumorigenesis and metastasis. siRNA-delivering LNP drug validated the therapeutic potential of targeting this axis in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USP19 exacerbates lipogenesis and colorectal carcinogenesis by stabilizing ME1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34965422/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ERK2 phosphorylates ME1 T103 to promote USP19 deubiquitinating and stabilizing ME1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USP19 deficiency attenuates lipogenesis and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ERK2 inhibition increases NRF2 trans-activating PD-L1 via ME1-mediated ROS reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USP19/ME1 is dysregulated, and combined targeting of ERK2/PD-L1 is effective in CRCs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipogenesis plays a critical role in colorectal carcinogenesis, but precisely how remains unclear. Here, we show that ERK2 phosphorylates ME1 at T103, thereby inhibiting its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and enhancing its interaction with USP19. USP19 antagonizes RNF1-mediated ME1 degradation by deubiquitination, which in turn promotes lipid metabolism and NADPH production and suppresses ROS. Meanwhile, ROS dramatically increases PD-L1 mRNA levels through accelerating expression of the transcription factor NRF2. Increased lipid metabolism is correlated with ERK2 activity and colorectal carcinogenesis in human patients. Therefore, the combination of ERK2 inhibitor and anti-PD-L1 antibody significantly inhibits spontaneous and chemically induced colorectal carcinogenesis. Collectively, the USP19-ME1 axis plays a vital role in colorectal carcinogenesis and may also provide a potential therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self-Delivery Janus-Prodrug for Precise Immuno-Chemotherapy of Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34958191/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromatized thioketal (ATK) linked the immunoregulatory molecule (budesonide, Bud) and the cytotoxic molecule (gemcitabine, Gem) to construct a ROS-activated Janus-prodrug, termed as BAG. Benefiting from the hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and other intermolecular interactions, BAG could self-assemble into nanoaggregates (BAG NA) with a well-defined spherical shape and uniform size distribution. Compared to the carrier-based drug delivery system, BAG NA have ultrahigh drug loading content and ROS concentration-dependent drug release. Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) is a typical disease in which chronic inflammation transforms into tumors. BAG NA can be internalized by colon cancer C26 cells and then triggered by excessive intracellular ROS to release nearly 100% of the drugs. Based on this, BAG NA showed a stronger pro-apoptotic effect than free Bud combined with free Gem. What is gratifying is that orally administered BAG NA can precisely accumulate in the diseased colon tissues of CAC mice induced by AOM/DSS and simultaneously release Bud and Gem. Bud can regulate the tumor immune microenvironment to restore and enhance the cytotoxicity of Gem. Therefore, BAG NA maximizes the synergistic therapeutic effect through co-delivery of Bud and Gem. This work provided a cutting-edge method for constructing self-delivery Janus-prodrug based on ATK and confirmed its potential application in inflammation-related carcinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anoikis is a programmed cell death occurring upon cell detachment from the correct extracellular matrix, thus disrupting integrin ligation. It is a critical mechanism in preventing dysplastic cell growth or attachment to an inappropriate matrix. Anoikis prevents detached epithelial cells from colonizing elsewhere and is thus essential for tissue homeostasis and development. As anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, two features associated with anoikis resistance, are crucial steps during tumour progression and metastatic spreading of cancer cells, anoikis deregulation has now evoked particular attention from the scientific community. The aim of this review is to analyse the molecular mechanisms governing both anoikis and anoikis resistance, focusing on their regulation in physiological processes, as well as in several diseases, including metastatic cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Punicalagin alleviates renal injury via the gut-kidney axis in high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34989745/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic renal injury was associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier. Punicalagin (PU) from pomegranates potentially impacts the microbial ecosystem, intestinal barrier, and renal function. Therefore, we hypothesized that PU may improve diabetic renal injury by modulating the gut-kidney axis. The present study evaluated the effect of PU on the gut-kidney axis and kidney function in a diabetic renal injury mouse model induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Mice were fed a HFD without PU or with at doses of 50 and 100 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for 8 weeks. Targeted metabolomics by GC-MS and 16S rRNA sequencing were implemented to determine short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and microbes. Further RNA sequencing analyses were performed to determine which differentially expressed genes were changed by PU. Compared with the DM model group, PU supplementation improved diabetic renal injury, ameliorated kidney architecture and function, and reshaped gut microbial ecology. Additionally, PU reversed HFD-induced gut barrier dysfunction, promoted cecal SCFA concentrations and inhibited serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and diamine oxidase (DAO) levels. Moreover, correlation analysis found that cecal SCFAs were significantly negatively correlated with inflammation-related genes in the kidney. The present results indicated that PU, a promising bioactive polyphenol, successfully improved diabetic renal injury, most likely through the gut-kidney axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim:&lt;/em&gt; To unveil genomic and immunohistochemical expression profiles associated with primary resistance to EGFR/BRAF targeted therapy in patients with BRAF-mutated and microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental design:&lt;/em&gt; In this multicenter case-control study on patients treated with EGFR/BRAF ± MEK blockade, we compared a primary resistance cohort (N = 20; RECISTv1.1 PD/SD, and progression-free survival [PFS] &amp;lt;16 weeks) versus a sensitive one (N = 19; RECISTv1.1 PR/CR, and PFS ≥16 weeks) in terms of clinical and genomic/expression data by means of comprehensive genomic profiling, tumour mutational burden (TMB), BRAF-mutant transcriptional subtypes (BM) classification and PTEN expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Left-sided tumours (28% of the total) were enriched in the sensitive versus resistant cohort (53% versus 10%, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.010). Genomic alterations in the PIK3CA/MTOR pathway, BM1 status and PTEN loss were similarly distributed among patients with resistant and sensitive tumours. Amplification of CCND1-3 genes were found only in patients with primary resistance (20% versus 0%, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.106). TMB and prevalence of intermediate TMB (TMB-I 6-20 mutations/Mb) were higher in the resistant versus sensitive cohort (median TMB: 6 [IQR, 3-7.29] versus 3 [IQR, 1.26-3.5]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.013; TMB-I/H: 60% versus 11%; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). Patients with TMB-I had shorter PFS (3.3 versus 5.9 months; HR = 2.19, 95%CI, 1.07-4.47, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.031) and overall survival (6.3 versus 10.5 months; HR = 2.22, 95%CI, 1.02-4.81, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.044).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Despite the small sample size, the association of a relatively higher TMB with limited benefit from EGFR/BRAF blockade in patients with MSS and BRAF-mutated mCRC deserves prospective validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A single-cell resolution atlas of human adenomas and serrated polyps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serrated polyps arise from metaplasia as opposed to stem cell expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cytotoxic immunity in serrated polyps occurs independently of hypermutation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distinct immune microenvironments track tumor cell-differentiation states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancers (CRCs) arise from precursor polyps whose cellular origins, molecular heterogeneity, and immunogenic potential may reveal diagnostic and therapeutic insights when analyzed at high resolution. We present a single-cell transcriptomic and imaging atlas of the two most common human colorectal polyps, conventional adenomas and serrated polyps, and their resulting CRC counterparts. Integrative analysis of 128 datasets from 62 participants reveals adenomas arise from WNT-driven expansion of stem cells, while serrated polyps derive from differentiated cells through gastric metaplasia. Metaplasia-associated damage is coupled to a cytotoxic immune microenvironment preceding hypermutation, driven partly by antigen-presentation differences associated with tumor cell-differentiation status. Microsatellite unstable CRCs contain distinct non-metaplastic regions where tumor cells acquire stem cell properties and cytotoxic immune cells are depleted. Our multi-omic atlas provides insights into malignant progression of colorectal polyps and their microenvironment, serving as a framework for precision surveillance and prevention of CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rotavirus NSP1 Contributes to Intestinal Viral Replication, Pathogenesis, and Transmission</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34903043/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotavirus (RV)-encoded nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1), the product of gene segment 5, effectively antagonizes host interferon (IFN) signaling via multiple mechanisms. Recent studies with the newly established RV reverse genetics system indicate that NSP1 is not essential for the replication of the simian RV SA11 strain in cell culture. However, the role of NSP1 in RV infection &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; remains poorly characterized due to the limited replication of heterologous simian RVs in the suckling mouse model. Here, we used an optimized reverse genetics system and successfully recovered recombinant murine RVs with or without NSP1 expression. While the NSP1-null virus replicated comparably with the parental murine RV in IFN-deficient and IFN-competent cell lines &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, it was highly attenuated in 5-day-old wild-type suckling pups in both the 129sv and C57BL/6 backgrounds. In the absence of NSP1 expression, murine RV had significantly reduced replication in the ileum, systemic spread to mesenteric lymph nodes, fecal shedding, diarrhea occurrence, and transmission to uninoculated littermates. The defective replication of the NSP1-null RV in small intestinal tissues occurred as early as 1 day postinfection. Of interest, the replication and pathogenesis defects of NSP1-null RV were only minimally rescued in &lt;em&gt;Stat1&lt;/em&gt; knockout pups, suggesting that NSP1 facilitates RV replication in an IFN-independent manner. Our findings highlight a pivotal function of NSP1 during homologous RV infections &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and identify NSP1 as an ideal viral protein for targeted attenuation for future vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotavirus remains one of the most important causes of severe diarrhea and dehydration in young children worldwide. Although NSP1 is dispensable for rotavirus replication in cell culture, its exact role in virus infection &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate, for the first time in a pathologically valid homologous small animal model, that in the context of a fully replication-competent, pathogenic, and transmissible murine rotavirus, loss of NSP1 expression substantially attenuated virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract, diarrheal disease, and virus transmission. Notably, the NSP1-deficient murine rotavirus also replicated poorly in mice lacking host interferon or inflammasome signaling. Our data provide the first piece of evidence that NSP1 is essential for murine rotavirus replication &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, making it an attractive target for developing improved next-generation rotavirus vaccines better suited for socioeconomically disadvantaged and immunocompromised individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Grouped-seq for integrated phenotypic and transcriptomic screening of patient-derived tumor organoids</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) have emerged as a reliable in vitro model for drug discovery. However, RNA sequencing-based analysis of PDOs treated with drugs has not been realized in a high-throughput format due to the limited quantity of organoids. Here, we translated a newly developed pooled RNA-seq methodology onto a superhydrophobic microwell array chip to realize an assay of genome-wide RNA output unified with phenotypic data (Grouped-seq). Over 10-fold reduction of sample and reagent consumption together with a new ligation-based barcode synthesis method lowers the cost to ∼$2 per RNA-seq sample. Patient-derived colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids with a number of 10 organoids per microwell were treated with four anti-CRC drugs across eight doses and analyzed by the Grouped-seq. Using a phenotype-assisted pathway enrichment analysis (PAPEA) method, the mechanism of actions of the drugs were correctly derived, illustrating the great potential of Grouped-seq for pharmacological screening with tumor organoids.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The deubiquitinase OTUD1 inhibits colonic inflammation by suppressing RIPK1-mediated NF-κB signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34876703/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3)-mediated ubiquitination and deubiquitinase (DUB)-mediated deubiquitination processes are closely associated with the occurrence and development of colonic inflammation. Ovarian tumor deubiquitinase 1 (OTUD1) is involved in immunoregulatory functions linked to infectious diseases. However, the effect of OTUD1 on intestinal immune responses during colonic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unclear. Here, we show that loss of OTUD1 in mice contributes to the pathogenesis of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis via excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that OTUD1 in hematopoietic cells plays a dominant role in protection against colitis. Mechanistically, OTUD1 physically interacts with receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and selectively cleaves K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIPK1 to inhibit the recruitment of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO). Moreover, the expression of OTUD1 in mucosa samples from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients was lower than that in mucosa samples from healthy controls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the UC-associated OTUD1 G430V mutation abolishes the ability of OTUD1 to inhibit RIPK1-mediated NF-κB activation and intestinal inflammation. Taken together, our study unveils a previously unexplored role of OTUD1 in moderating intestinal inflammation by inhibiting RIPK1-mediated NF-κB activation, suggesting that the OTUD1-RIPK1 axis could be a potential target for the treatment of IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helicobacter hepaticus&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Hhep&lt;/em&gt;) colonization reduces colorectal cancer burden in mice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hhep&lt;/em&gt; induces CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Tfh cell- and B cell-dependent anti-colorectal cancer immunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hhep&lt;/em&gt; colonization expands peritumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hhep&lt;/em&gt;-specific Tfh cells promote both TLSs and anti-tumor immunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The composition of the intestinal microbiota is associated with both the development of tumors and the efficacy of anti-tumor immunity. Here, we examined the impact of microbiota-specific T cells in anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) immunity. Introduction of &lt;em&gt;Helicobacter hepaticus&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Hhep&lt;/em&gt;) in a mouse model of CRC did not alter the microbial landscape but increased tumor infiltration by cytotoxic lymphocytes and inhibited tumor growth. Anti-tumor immunity was independent of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells but dependent upon CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. &lt;em&gt;Hhep&lt;/em&gt; colonization induced &lt;em&gt;Hhep&lt;/em&gt;-specific T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, increased the number of colon Tfh cells, and supported the maturation of &lt;em&gt;Hhep&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tumor-adjacent tertiary lymphoid structures. Tfh cells were necessary for &lt;em&gt;Hhep&lt;/em&gt;-mediated tumor control and immune infiltration, and adoptive transfer of &lt;em&gt;Hhep&lt;/em&gt;-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells to Tfh cell-deficient &lt;em&gt;Bcl6&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;Cd4&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice restored anti-tumor immunity. Thus, introduction of immunogenic intestinal bacteria can promote Tfh-associated anti-tumor immunity in the colon, suggesting therapeutic approaches for the treatment of CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Patient-derived organoids as a preclinical platform for precision medicine in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34850547/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient-derived organoids are being considered as models that can help guide personalized therapy through in vitro anticancer drug response evaluation. However, attempts to quantify in vitro drug responses in organoids and compare them with responses in matched patients remain inadequate. In this study, we investigated whether drug responses of organoids correlate with clinical responses of matched patients and disease progression of patients. Organoids were established from 54 patients with colorectal cancer who (except for one patient) did not receive any form of therapy before, and tumor organoids were assessed through whole-exome sequencing. For comparisons of in vitro drug responses in matched patients, we developed an &amp;lsquo;organoid score&amp;rsquo; based on the variable anticancer treatment responses observed in organoids. Very interestingly, a higher organoid score was significantly correlated with a lower tumor regression rate after the standard-of-care treatment in matched patients. Additionally, we confirmed that patients with a higher organoid score (≥ 2.5) had poorer progression-free survival compared with those with a lower organoid score (&amp;lt; 2.5). Furthermore, to assess potential drug repurposing using an FDA-approved drug library, ten tumor organoids derived from patients with disease progression were applied to a simulation platform. Taken together, organoids and organoid scores can facilitate the prediction of anticancer therapy efficacy, and they can be used as a simulation model to determine the next therapeutic options through drug screening. Organoids will be an attractive platform to enable the implementation of personalized therapy for colorectal cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Redox-sensitive cyclophilin A elicits chemoresistance through realigning cellular oxidative status in colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34852234/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CypA is identified as a redox-sensitive and druggable protein upregulated in CRC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CypA forms a disulfide bond at Cys115 and Cys161, which is reduced by PRDX2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CypA elicits CRC chemoresistance via redox modification-mediated antioxidant defense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting CypA by cyclosporine A potentiates chemotherapeutic efficacy in CRC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer cells utilize rapidly elevated cellular antioxidant programs to accommodate chemotherapy-induced oxidative stress; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. Here we screen redox-sensitive effectors as potential therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment and find that cyclophilin A (CypA) is a compelling candidate. Our results show that CypA forms an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys115 and Cys161 upon oxidative stress and the oxidized cysteines in CypA are recycled to a reduced state by peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2). Furthermore, CypA reduces cellular reactive oxygen species levels and increases CRC cell survival under insults of H2O2 and chemotherapeutics through a CypA-PRDX2-mediated antioxidant apparatus. Notably, CypA is upregulated in chemoresistant CRC samples, which predicts poor prognosis. Moreover, targeting CypA by cyclosporine A exhibits promising efficacy against chemoresistant CRC when combined with chemotherapeutics. Collectively, our findings highlight CypA as a component of cellular noncanonical antioxidant defense and as a potential druggable therapeutic target to ameliorate CRC chemoresistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gut microbiota responds to the changes in the intestinal microenvironment by modulating specific bacterial-derived bioactive metabolites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCFAs serve as energy substrates to connect dietary patterns and gut microbiota, thereby improving intestinal health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCFAs are promising to be an independent predictor of immunotherapy response in various types of cancers including CRC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCFAs have the potential to serve as a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. It involves the complex interactions between genetic factors, environmental exposure, and gut microbiota. Specific changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome have been described in CRC, supporting the critical role of gut microbiota dysbiosis and microbiota-related metabolites in the tumorigenesis process. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the principal metabolites generated from the gut microbial fermentation of insoluble dietary fiber, can directly activate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs), and serve as energy substrates to connect dietary patterns and gut microbiota, thereby improving the intestinal health. A significantly lower abundance of SCFAs and SCFA-producing bacteria has been demonstrated in CRC, and the supplementation of SCFA-producing probiotics can inhibit intestinal tumor development. SCFAs-guided modulation in both mouse and human CRC models augmented their responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. This review briefly summarizes the complex crosstalk between SCFAs and CRC, which might inspire new approaches for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of CRC on the basis of gut microbiota-derived metabolites SCFAs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free Feeding of CpG-Oligodeoxynucleotide Particles Prophylactically Attenuates Allergic Airway Inflammation and Hyperresponsiveness in Mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs) constitute an attractive alternative for asthma treatment. However, very little evidence is available from studies on the oral administration of CpG-ODNs in animals. Previously, we developed acid-resistant particles (named ODNcap) as an oral delivery device for ODNs. Here, we showed that free feeding of an ODNcap-containing feed prophylactically attenuates allergic airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and goblet cell hyperplasia in an ovalbumin-induced asthma model. Using transcriptomics-driven approaches, we demonstrated that injury of pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes accompanies allergen inhalation challenge, but is inhibited by ODNcap feeding. We also showed the participation of an airway antimicrobial peptide (Reg3γ) and fecal microbiota in the ODNcap-mediated effects. Collectively, our findings suggest that daily oral ingestion of ODNcap may provide preventive effects on allergic bronchopulmonary insults via regulation of mechanisms involved in the gut-lung connection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of a choroid plexus vascular barrier closing during intestinal inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to 40% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease present with psychosocial disturbances. We previously identified a gut vascular barrier that controls the dissemination of bacteria from the intestine to the liver. Here, we describe a vascular barrier in the brain choroid plexus (PVB) that is modulated in response to intestinal inflammation through bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide. The inflammatory response induces PVB closure after gut vascular barrier opening by the up-regulation of the wingless-type, catenin-beta 1 (Wnt/β-catenin) signaling pathway, rendering it inaccessible to large molecules. In a model of genetically driven closure of choroid plexus endothelial cells, we observed a deficit in short-term memory and anxiety-like behavior, suggesting that PVB closure may correlate with mental deficits. Inflammatory bowel disease–related mental symptoms may thus be the consequence of a deregulated gut–brain vascular axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phase separation drives RNA virus-induced activation of the NLRP6 inflammasome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dsRNA induces liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of NLRP6 &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and in cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASC solidifies LLPS of NLRP6 and RNA to promote inflammasome activation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poly-Lysine region in NLRP6 is critical for multivalent interaction and LLPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase separation of NLRP6 promotes inflammasome activation in intestine and liver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NLRP6 is important in host defense by inducing functional outcomes including inflammasome activation and interferon production. Here, we show that NLRP6 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon interaction with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and in cells, and an intrinsically disordered poly-lysine sequence (K350-354) of NLRP6 is important for multivalent interactions, phase separation, and inflammasome activation. &lt;em&gt;Nlrp6&lt;/em&gt;-deficient or &lt;em&gt;Nlrp6&lt;sup&gt;K350-354A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mutant mice show reduced inflammasome activation upon mouse hepatitis virus or rotavirus infection, and in steady state stimulated by intestinal microbiota, implicating NLRP6 LLPS in anti-microbial immunity. Recruitment of ASC via helical assembly solidifies NLRP6 condensates, and ASC further recruits and activates caspase-1. Lipoteichoic acid, a known NLRP6 ligand, also promotes NLRP6 LLPS, and DHX15, a helicase in NLRP6-induced interferon signaling, co-forms condensates with NLRP6 and dsRNA. Thus, LLPS of NLRP6 is a common response to ligand stimulation, which serves to direct NLRP6 to distinct functional outcomes depending on the cellular context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AAMP promotes colorectal cancermetastasis by suppressing SMURF2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of RhoA</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34901393/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metastasis is considered the leading cause of cancer death due to the limited possibilities to therapeutically target this process. How the ubiquitination machinery contributes to metastasis remains underexplored. Angio-associated migratory cell protein (AAMP), a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in cell migration, has been reported to play oncogenic roles in breast and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the role of AAMP in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been demonstrated. Here, we report that AAMP is aberrantly upregulated in metastatic CRC and that AAMP upregulation is correlated with the poor survival of CRC patients. AAMP knockdown significantly attenuated the migration and invasion of CRC cells, while AAMP overexpression led to the opposite effects. Mechanistically, we identified Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) as a target of AAMP. Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor (SMURF) 2 was previously found to be a CRC suppressor. Notably, we discovered here that SMURF2 acted as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of RhoA. AAMP stabilized RhoA by binding to it and suppressing its SMURF2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Subsequently, the level of active RhoA was increased, thereby accelerating CRC cell migration and invasion. These findings indicate a new potential antitumor target for CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatiotemporal Immune Landscape of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis at Single-Cell Level</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34417225/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver metastasis, the leading cause of colorectal cancer mortality, exhibits a highly heterogeneous and suppressive immune microenvironment. Here, we sequenced 97 matched samples by using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. Strikingly, the metastatic microenvironment underwent remarkable spatial reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells such as &lt;em&gt;MRC1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;CCL18&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; M2-like macrophages. We further developed scMetabolism, a computational pipeline for quantifying single-cell metabolism, and observed that those macrophages harbored enhanced metabolic activity. Interestingly, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could block this status and restore the antitumor immune balance in responsive patients, whereas the nonresponsive patients deteriorated into a more suppressive one. Our work described the immune evolution of metastasis and uncovered the black box of how tumors respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a single-cell and spatial atlas of colorectal liver metastasis and found the highly metabolically activated &lt;em&gt;MRC1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;CCL18&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; M2-like macrophages in metastatic sites. Efficient neoadjuvant chemotherapy can slow down such metabolic activation, raising the possibility to target metabolism pathways in metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enterically derived high-density lipoprotein restrains liver injury through the portal vein</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) requires apoA1 and the cholesterol transporter ABCA1. Although the liver generates most of the HDL in the blood, HDL synthesis also occurs in the small intestine. Here, we show that intestine-derived HDL traverses the portal vein in the HDL3 subspecies form, in complex with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP). HDL3, but not HDL2 or low-density lipoprotein, prevented LPS binding to and inflammatory activation of liver macrophages and instead supported extracellular inactivation of LPS. In mouse models involving surgical, dietary, or alcoholic intestinal insult, loss of intestine-derived HDL worsened liver injury, whereas outcomes were improved by therapeutics that elevated and depended upon raising intestinal HDL. Thus, protection of the liver from injury in response to gut-derived LPS is a major function of intestinally synthesized HDL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between gut microbial dysbiosis and acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD) is still unclear. Here, we show that oral administration of the probiotic &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;L. casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt;) corrected bilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced gut microbial dysbiosis, alleviated kidney injury, and delayed its progression to CKD in mice. &lt;em&gt;L. casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt; elevated the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and nicotinamide in the serum and kidney, resulting in reduced renal inflammation and damage to renal tubular epithelial cells. We also performed a 1-year phase 1 placebo-controlled study of oral &lt;em&gt;L. casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt; use (Chinese clinical trial registry, ChiCTR-INR-17013952), which was well tolerated and slowed the decline of kidney function in individuals with stage 3-5 CKD. These results show that oral administration of &lt;em&gt;L. casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt;, by altering SCFAs and nicotinamide metabolism, is a potential therapy to mitigate kidney injury and slow the progression of renal decline.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HIPK2 phosphorylates HDAC3 for NF-κB acetylation to ameliorate colitis-associated colorectal carcinoma and sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34244427/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although inflammation is critical for the clearance of pathogens, uncontrolled inflammation also contributes to the development of multiple diseases such as cancer and sepsis. Since NF-κB-mediated transactivation in the nucleus is pivotal downstream of various stimuli to induce inflammation, searching the nuclear-localized targets specifically regulating NF-κB activation will provide important therapeutic application. Here, we have identified that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), a nuclear serine/threonine kinase, increases its expression in inflammatory macrophages. Importantly, HIPK2 deficiency or overexpression could enhance or inhibit inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated macrophages, respectively. HIPK2-deficient mice were more susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxemia and CLP-induced sepsis. Adoptive transfer of &lt;em&gt;Hipk2&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; bone marrow cells (BMs) also aggravated AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer. Mechanistically, HIPK2 bound and phosphorylated histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) at serine 374 to inhibit its enzymatic activity, thus reducing the deacetylation of p65 at lysine 218 to suppress NF-κB activation. Notably, the HDAC3 inhibitors protected wild-type or &lt;em&gt;Hipk2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; BMs-reconstituted mice from LPS-induced endotoxemia. Our findings suggest that the HIPK2-HDAC3-p65 module in macrophages restrains excessive inflammation, which may represent a new layer of therapeutic mechanism for colitis-associated colorectal cancer and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MYC is a transcription factor with broad biological functions, notably in the control of cell proliferation. Here, we show that intestinal MYC regulates systemic metabolism. We find that MYC expression is increased in ileum biopsies from individuals with obesity and positively correlates with body mass index. Intestine-specific reduction of MYC in mice improves high-fat-diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis. Mechanistically, reduced expression of MYC in the intestine promotes glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) production and secretion. Moreover, we identify Cers4, encoding ceramide synthase 4, catalysing de novo ceramide synthesis, as a MYC target gene. Finally, we show that administration of the MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 has beneficial effects on high-fat-diet-induced metabolic disorders, and is accompanied by increased GLP-1 and reduced ceramide levels in serum. This study positions intestinal MYC as a putative drug target against metabolic diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteriophages have important roles in the ecology of the human gut microbiome but are under-represented in reference databases. To address this problem, we assembled the Metagenomic Gut Virus catalogue that comprises 189,680 viral genomes from 11,810 publicly available human stool metagenomes. Over 75% of genomes represent double-stranded DNA phages that infect members of the Bacteroidia and Clostridia classes. Based on sequence clustering we identified 54,118 candidate viral species, 92% of which were not found in existing databases. The Metagenomic Gut Virus catalogue improves detection of viruses in stool metagenomes and accounts for nearly 40% of CRISPR spacers found in human gut Bacteria and Archaea. We also produced a catalogue of 459,375 viral protein clusters to explore the functional potential of the gut virome. This revealed tens of thousands of diversity-generating retroelements, which use error-prone reverse transcription to mutate target genes and may be involved in the molecular arms race between phages and their bacterial hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Endogenous retroviruses promote homeostatic and inflammatory responses to the microbiota</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbiota plays a fundamental role in regulating host immunity. However, the processes involved in the initiation and regulation of immunity to the microbiota remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the skin microbiota promotes the discrete expression of defined endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Keratinocyte-intrinsic responses to ERVs depended on cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) signaling and promoted the induction of commensal-specific T cells. Inhibition of ERV reverse transcription significantly impacted these responses, resulting in impaired immunity to the microbiota and its associated tissue repair function. Conversely, a lipid-enriched diet primed the skin for heightened ERV- expression in response to commensal colonization, leading to increased immune responses and tissue inflammation. Together, our results support the idea that the host may have co-opted its endogenous virome as a means to communicate with the exogenous microbiota, resulting in a multi-kingdom dialog that controls both tissue homeostasis and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DHX15 is required to control RNA virus-induced intestinal inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA helicases play critical roles in various biological processes, including serving as viral RNA sensors in innate immunity. Here, we find that RNA helicase DEAH-box helicase 15 (DHX15) is essential for type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-β), type III IFN (IFN-λ3), and inflammasome-derived cytokine IL-18 production by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in response to poly I:C and RNA viruses with preference of enteric RNA viruses, but not DNA virus. Importantly, we generate IEC-specific Dhx15-knockout mice and demonstrate that DHX15 is required for controlling intestinal inflammation induced by enteric RNA virus rotavirus in suckling mice and reovirus in adult mice in vivo, which owes to impaired IFN-β, IFN-λ3, and IL-18 production in IECs from Dhx15-deficient mice. Mechanistically, DHX15 interacts with NLRP6 to trigger NLRP6 inflammasome assembly and activation for inducing IL-18 secretion in IECs. Collectively, our report reveals critical roles for DHX15 in sensing enteric RNA viruses in IECs and controlling intestinal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GPR34-mediated sensing of lysophosphatidylserine released by apoptotic neutrophils activates type 3 innate lymphoid cells to mediate tissue repair</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils migrate rapidly to damaged tissue and play critical roles in host defense and tissue homeostasis. Here we investigated the mechanisms whereby neutrophils participate in tissue repair. In an intestinal epithelia injury model, neutrophil depletion exacerbated colitis and associated with reduced interleukin (IL)-22 and limited activation of type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). Co-culture with neutrophils activated ILC3s in a manner dependent on neutrophil apoptosis. Metabolomic analyses revealed that lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) from apoptotic neutrophils directly stimulated ILC3 activation. ILC3-specific deletion of Gpr34, encoding the LysoPS receptor GPR34, or inhibition of downstream PI3K-AKT or ERK suppressed IL-22 production in response to apoptotic neutrophils. Gpr34&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited compromised ILC3 activation and tissue repair during colon injury, and neutrophil depletion abrogated these defects. GPR34 deficiency in ILC3s limited IL-22 production and tissue repair in vivo in settings of colon and skin injury. Thus, GPR34 is an ILC3-expressed damage-sensing receptor that triggers tissue repair upon recognition of dying neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Early-Life Microbial Restitution Reduces Colitis Risk Promoted by Antibiotic-Induced Gut Dysbiosis in Interleukin 10-/- Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34111469/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Perturbations in the early-life gut microbiome are associated with increased risk for complex immune disorders like inflammatory bowel diseases. We previously showed that maternal antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis vertically transmitted to offspring increases experimental colitis risk in interleukin (IL) 10 gene deficient (IL10-/-) mice, a finding that may result from the loss/lack of essential microbes needed for appropriate immunologic education early in life. Here, we aimed to identify key microbes required for proper development of the early-life gut microbiome that decrease colitis risk in genetically susceptible animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Metagenomic sequencing followed by reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes was performed on fecal samples of IL10-/- mice with and without antibiotic-induced dysbiosis to identify potential missing microbial members needed for immunologic education. One high-value target strain was then engrafted early and/or late into the gut microbiomes of IL10-/- mice with antibiotic-induced dysbiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Early-, but not late-, life engraftment of a single dominant Bacteroides strain of non-antibiotic-treated IL10-/- mice was sufficient to restore the development of the gut microbiome, promote immune tolerance, and prevent colitis in IL10-/- mice that had antibiotic-induced dysbiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Restitution of a keystone microbial strain missing in the early-life antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis results in recovery of the microbiome, proper development of immune tolerance, and reduced risk for colitis in genetically prone hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiota plays important roles in human health through regulating both physiological homeostasis and disease emergence. The accumulation of metagenomic sequencing studies enables us to better understand the temporal and spatial variations of the gut microbiota under different physiological and pathological conditions. However, it is inconvenient for scientists to query and retrieve published data; thus, a comprehensive resource for the quantitative gut metagenome is urgently needed. In this study, we developed &lt;a href=&#34;http://gutmega.omicsbio.info/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gut MEtaGenome Atlas (gutMEGA)&lt;/a&gt;, a well-annotated comprehensive database, to curate and host published quantitative gut microbiota datasets from Homo sapiens. By carefully curating the gut microbiota composition, phenotypes and experimental information, &lt;a href=&#34;http://gutmega.omicsbio.info/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gutMEGA&lt;/a&gt; finally integrated 59 132 quantification events for 6457 taxa at seven different levels (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species) under 776 conditions. Moreover, with various browsing and search functions, &lt;a href=&#34;http://gutmega.omicsbio.info/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gutMEGA&lt;/a&gt; provides a fast and simple way for users to obtain the relative abundances of intestinal microbes among phenotypes. Overall, &lt;a href=&#34;http://gutmega.omicsbio.info/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gutMEGA&lt;/a&gt; is a convenient and comprehensive resource for gut metagenome research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Temporal landscape of human gut RNA and DNA virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33853691/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the enveloped RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal samples, and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We enrolled 98 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity (3 asymptomatic, 53 mild, 34 moderate, 5 severe, 3 critical) and 78 non-COVID-19 controls matched for gender and co-morbidities. All subjects had fecal specimens sampled at inclusion. Blood specimens were collected for COVID-19 patients at admission to test for inflammatory markers and white cell counts. Among COVID-19 cases, 37 (38%) patients had serial fecal samples collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until after discharge. Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, we sequenced and profiled the fecal RNA and DNA virome. We investigated alterations and longitudinal dynamics of the gut virome in association with disease severity and blood parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Patients with COVID-19 showed underrepresentation of Pepper mild mottle virus (RNA virus) and multiple bacteriophage lineages (DNA viruses) and enrichment of environment-derived eukaryotic DNA viruses in fecal samples, compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Such gut virome alterations persisted up to 30 days after disease resolution. Fecal virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection harbored more stress-, inflammation-, and virulence-associated gene encoding capacities including those pertaining to bacteriophage integration, DNA repair, and metabolism and virulence associated with their bacterial host. Baseline fecal abundance of 10 virus species (1 RNA virus, pepper chlorotic spot virus, and 9 DNA virus species) inversely correlated with disease COVID-19 severity. These viruses inversely correlated with blood levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, white cells, and neutrophils. Among the 10 COVID-19 severity-associated DNA virus species, 4 showed inverse correlation with age; 5 showed persistent lower abundance both during disease course and after disease resolution relative to non-COVID-19 subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Both enteric RNA and DNA virome in COVID-19 patients were different from non-COVID-19 subjects, which persisted after disease resolution of COVID-19. Gut virome may calibrate host immunity and regulate severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observation that gut viruses inversely correlated with both severity of COVID-19 and host age may partly explain that older subjects are prone to severe and worse COVID-19 outcomes. Altogether, our data highlight the importance of human gut virome in severity and potentially therapeutics of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrated gut virome and bacteriome dynamics in COVID-19 patients</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the current global pandemic of COVID-19; this virus infects multiple organs, such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. The microbiome in these organs, including the bacteriome and virome, responds to infection and might also influence disease progression and treatment outcome. In a cohort of 13 COVID-19 patients in Beijing, China, we observed that the gut virome and bacteriome in the COVID-19 patients were notably different from those of five healthy controls. We identified a bacterial dysbiosis signature by observing reduced diversity and viral shifts in patients, and among the patients, the bacterial/viral compositions were different between patients of different severities, although these differences are not entirely distinguishable from the effect of antibiotics. Severe cases of COVID-19 exhibited a greater abundance of opportunistic pathogens but were depleted for butyrate-producing groups of bacteria compared with mild to moderate cases. We replicated our findings in a mouse COVID-19 model, confirmed virome differences and bacteriome dysbiosis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and observed that immune/infection-related genes were differentially expressed in gut epithelial cells during infection, possibly explaining the virome and bacteriome dynamics. Our results suggest that the components of the microbiome, including the bacteriome and virome, are affected by SARS-CoV-2 infections, while their compositional signatures could reflect or even contribute to disease severity and recovery processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteriophages drive evolutionary change in bacterial communities by creating gene flow networks that fuel ecological adaptions. However, the extent of viral diversity and its prevalence in the human gut remains largely unknown. Here, we introduce the Gut Phage Database, a collection of ∼142,000 non-redundant viral genomes (&amp;gt;10 kb) obtained by mining a dataset of 28,060 globally distributed human gut metagenomes and 2,898 reference genomes of cultured gut bacteria. Host assignment revealed that viral diversity is highest in the Firmicutes phyla and that ∼36% of viral clusters (VCs) are not restricted to a single species, creating gene flow networks across phylogenetically distinct bacterial species. Epidemiological analysis uncovered 280 globally distributed VCs found in at least 5 continents and a highly prevalent phage clade with features reminiscent of p-crAssphage. This high-quality, large-scale catalog of phage genomes will improve future virome studies and enable ecological and evolutionary analysis of human gut bacteriophages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the colon, long-term exposure to chronic inflammation drives colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. While the causal and clinical links are well established, molecular understanding of how chronic inflammation leads to the development of colon cancer is lacking. Here we deconstruct the evolving microenvironment of CAC by measuring proteomic changes and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization over time in a mouse model of CAC. We detect early changes in ECM structure and composition, and report a crucial role for the transcriptional regulator heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in orchestrating these events. Loss of HSF1 abrogates ECM assembly by colon fibroblasts in cell-culture, prevents inflammation-induced ECM remodeling in mice and inhibits progression to CAC. Establishing relevance to human disease, we find high activation of stromal HSF1 in CAC patients, and detect the HSF1-dependent proteomic ECM signature in human colorectal cancer. Thus, HSF1-dependent ECM remodeling plays a crucial role in mediating inflammation-driven colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commensal microbiota has been implicated in the regulation of a diverse array of physiological processes, both within the gastrointestinal tract and at distant tissue sites. Cancer is no exception, and distinct aspects of the microbiota have been reported to have either pro- or anti-tumor effects. The functional role of the microbiota in regulating not only mucosal but also systemic immune responses has led to investigations into the impact on cancer immunotherapies, particularly with agents targeting the immunologic checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4. Microbial sequencing and reconstitution of germ-free mice have indicated both positive and negative regulatory bacteria likely exist, which either promote or interfere with immunotherapy efficacy. These collective findings have led to the development of clinical trials pursuing microbiome-based therapeutic interventions, with the hope of expanding immunotherapy efficacy. This review summarizes recent knowledge about the relationship between the host microbiota and cancer and anti-tumor immune response, with implications for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors using lung and colonic organoids</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need to create novel models using human disease-relevant cells to study severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) biology and to facilitate drug screening. Here, as SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-LOs). The hPSC-LOs (particularly alveolar type-II-like cells) are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and showed robust induction of chemokines following SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to what is seen in patients with COVID-19. Nearly 25% of these patients also have gastrointestinal manifestations, which are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes1. We therefore also generated complementary hPSC-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the response of colonic cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that multiple colonic cell types, especially enterocytes, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using hPSC-LOs, we performed a high-throughput screen of drugs approved by the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and identified entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, including imatinib, mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride. Treatment at physiologically relevant levels of these drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of both hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs infected by SARS-CoV-2 can serve as disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a valuable resource for drug screening to identify candidate COVID-19 therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A STAT3 palmitoylation cycle promotes TH17 differentiation and colitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33029007/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cysteine palmitoylation (S-palmitoylation) is a reversible post-translational modification that is installed by the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases and is reversed by several acyl protein thioesterases. Although thousands of human proteins are known to undergo S-palmitoylation, how this modification is regulated to modulate specific biological functions is poorly understood. Here we report that the key T helper 17 (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17) cell differentiation stimulator, STAT3, is subject to reversible S-palmitoylation on cysteine 108. DHHC7 palmitoylates STAT3 and promotes its membrane recruitment and phosphorylation. Acyl protein thioesterase 2 (APT2, also known as LYPLA2) depalmitoylates phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and enables it to translocate to the nucleus. This palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle enhances STAT3 activation and promotes T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cell differentiation; perturbation of either palmitoylation or depalmitoylation negatively affects T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cell differentiation. Overactivation of T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells is associated with several inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a mouse model, pharmacological inhibition of APT2 or knockout of Zdhhc7-which encodes DHHC7-relieves the symptoms of IBD. Our study reveals not only a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBD but also a model through which S-palmitoylation regulates cell signalling, which might be broadly applicable for understanding the signalling functions of numerous S-palmitoylation events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome has been implicated in multiple human chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Determining its mechanistic role in disease has been difficult due to apparent disconnects between animal and human studies and lack of an integrated multi-omics view of disease-specific physiological changes. We integrated longitudinal multi-omics data from the gut microbiome, metabolome, host epigenome, and transcriptome in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) host physiology. We identified IBS subtype-specific and symptom-related variation in microbial composition and function. A subset of identified changes in microbial metabolites correspond to host physiological mechanisms that are relevant to IBS. By integrating multiple data layers, we identified purine metabolism as a novel host-microbial metabolic pathway in IBS with translational potential. Our study highlights the importance of longitudinal sampling and integrating complementary multi-omics data to identify functional mechanisms that can serve as therapeutic targets in a comprehensive treatment strategy for chronic GI diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Excessive deubiquitination of NLRP3-R779C variant contributes to very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease development</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32941940/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/32941940/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract occurring during infancy or early childhood. NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has emerged as a crucial regulator of intestinal homeostasis; however, whether NLRP3 variants may modify VEOIBD risk is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sought to investigate whether and how a rare NLRP3 variant, found in 3 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, contributes to VEOIBD development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were performed to screen disease-associated NLRP3 variants from a cohort of children with VEOIBD. Inflammasome activation was determined in reconstituted HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells with NLRP3 inflammasome components, doxycycline-inducible NLRP3 macrophages, as well as PBMCs and biopsies from patients with NLRP3 variants. Pathogenesis of the variants was determined using a dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute colitis model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a dominant gain-of-function missense variant of NLRP3, encoded by rs772009059 (R779C), in 3 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Functional analysis revealed that R779C increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in macrophages. This was mediated by enhanced deubiquitination of NLRP3 via binding with deubiquitinases BRCC3 and JOSD2, which are highly expressed in myeloid cells. In a dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute colitis model, NLRP3-R779C in hematopoietic cells resulted in more severe colitis, which can be ameliorated via knockdown of BRCC3 or JOSD2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRCC3 and JOSD2 mediate NLRP3-R779C deubiquitination, which promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the risk of developing VEOIBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Gut Virome Database Reveals Age-Dependent Patterns of Virome Diversity in the Human Gut</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome profoundly affects human health and disease, and their infecting viruses are likely as important, but often missed because of reference database limitations. Here, we (1) built a human Gut Virome Database (GVD) from 2,697 viral particle or microbial metagenomes from 1,986 individuals representing 16 countries, (2) assess its effectiveness, and (3) report a meta-analysis that reveals age-dependent patterns across healthy Westerners. The GVD contains 33,242 unique viral populations (approximately species-level taxa) and improves average viral detection rates over viral RefSeq and IMG/VR nearly 182-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively. GVD meta-analyses show highly personalized viromes, reveal that inter-study variability from technical artifacts is larger than any &amp;ldquo;disease&amp;rdquo; effect at the population level, and document how viral diversity changes from human infancy into senescence. Together, this compact foundational resource, these standardization guidelines, and these meta-analysis findings provide a systematic toolkit to help maximize our understanding of viral roles in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Roadmap for the Future of Colorectal Cancer Screening in the United States</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/32634626/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Gastroenterological Association&amp;rsquo;s Center for Gastrointestinal Innovation and Technology convened a consensus conference in December 2018, entitled, &amp;ldquo;Colorectal Cancer Screening and Surveillance: Role of Emerging Technology and Innovation to Improve Outcomes.&amp;rdquo; The goal of the conference, which attracted more than 60 experts in screening and related disciplines, including the authors, was to envision a future in which colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and surveillance are optimized, and to identify barriers to achieving that future. This White Paper originates from that meeting and delineates the priorities and steps needed to improve CRC outcomes, with the goal of minimizing CRC morbidity and mortality. A one-size-fits-all approach to CRC screening has not and is unlikely to result in increased screening uptake or desired outcomes owing to barriers stemming from behavioral, cultural, and socioeconomic causes, especially when combined with inefficiencies in deployment of screening technologies. Overcoming these barriers will require the following: efficient utilization of multiple screening modalities to achieve increased uptake; continued development of noninvasive screening tests, with iterative reassessments of how best to integrate new technologies; and improved personal risk assessment to better risk-stratify patients for appropriate screening testing paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interferon regulatory factor 1 regulates PANoptosis to prevent colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32554929/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) regulates diverse biological functions, including modulation of cellular responses involved in tumorigenesis. Genetic mutations and altered IRF1 function are associated with several cancers. Although the function of IRF1 in the immunobiology of cancer is emerging, IRF1-specific mechanisms regulating tumorigenesis and tissue homeostasis in vivo are not clear. Here, we found that mice lacking IRF1 were hypersusceptible to colorectal tumorigenesis. IRF1 functions in both the myeloid and epithelial compartments to confer protection against AOM/DSS-induced colorectal tumorigenesis. We further found that IRF1 also prevents tumorigenesis in a spontaneous mouse model of colorectal cancer. The attenuated cell death in the colons of Irf1-/- mice was due to defective pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis). IRF1 does not regulate inflammation and the inflammasome in the colon. Overall, our study identified IRF1 as an upstream regulator of PANoptosis to induce cell death during colitis-associated tumorigenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influenza infection elicits an expansion of gut population of endogenous Bifidobacterium animalis which protects mice against infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32345342/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Influenza is a severe respiratory illness that continually threatens global health. It has been widely known that gut microbiota modulates the host response to protect against influenza infection, but mechanistic details remain largely unknown. Here, we took advantage of the phenomenon of lethal dose 50 (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and metagenomic sequencing analysis to identify specific anti-influenza gut microbes and analyze the underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Transferring fecal microbes from mice that survive virulent influenza H7N9 infection into antibiotic-treated mice confers resistance to infection. Some gut microbes exhibit differential features to lethal influenza infection depending on the infection outcome. Bifidobacterium pseudolongum and Bifidobacterium animalis levels are significantly elevated in surviving mice when compared to dead or mock-infected mice. Oral administration of B. animalis alone or the combination of both significantly reduces the severity of H7N9 infection in both antibiotic-treated and germ-free mice. Functional metagenomic analysis suggests that B. animalis mediates the anti-influenza effect via several specific metabolic molecules. In vivo tests confirm valine and coenzyme A produce an anti-influenza effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings show that the severity of influenza infection is closely related to the heterogeneous responses of the gut microbiota. We demonstrate the anti-influenza effect of B. animalis, and also find that the gut population of endogenous B. animalis can expand to enhance host influenza resistance when lethal influenza infection occurs, representing a novel interaction between host and gut microbiota. Further, our data suggest the potential utility of Bifidobacterium in the prevention and as a prognostic predictor of influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interaction Between the Microbiota, Epithelia, and Immune Cells in the Intestine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gastrointestinal tract harbors numerous commensal bacteria, referred to as the microbiota, that benefit host health by digesting dietary components and eliminating pathogens. The intestinal microbiota maintains epithelial barrier integrity and shapes the mucosal immune system, balancing host defense and oral tolerance with microbial metabolites, components, and attachment to host cells. To avoid aberrant immune responses, epithelial cells segregate the intestinal microbiota from immune cells by constructing chemical and physical barriers, leading to the establishment of host-commensal mutualism. Furthermore, intestinal immune cells participate in the maintenance of a healthy microbiota community and reinforce epithelial barrier functions. Perturbations of the microbiota composition are commonly observed in patients with autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory disorders. An understanding of the intimate interactions between the intestinal microbiota, epithelial cells, and immune cells that are crucial for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis might promote advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From Association to Causality: the Role of the Gut Microbiota and Its Functional Products on Host Metabolism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many genomic studies have revealed associations between the gut microbiota composition and host metabolism. These observations led to the idea that a causal relationship could exist between the microbiota and metabolic diseases, a concept supported by studies showing compositional changes in the microbial community in metabolic diseases and transmissibility of host phenotype via microbiota transfer. Accumulating data suggest that the microbiota may affect host metabolic phenotypes through the production of metabolites. These bioactive microbial metabolites, sensitive fingerprints of microbial function, can act as inter-kingdom signaling messengers via penetration into host blood circulation and tissues. These fingerprints may be used for diagnostic purposes, and increased understanding of strain specificity in producing microbial metabolites can identify bacterial strains or specific metabolites that can be used for therapeutic purposes. Here, we will review data supporting the causal role of the gut microbiota in metabolism and discuss mechanisms and potential clinical implications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is considered a disease of the pulmonary vasculature. Limited progress has been made in preventing or arresting progression of PAH despite extensive efforts. Our previous studies indicated that PAH could be considered a systemic disease since its pathology involves interplay of multiple organs. This, coupled with increasing implication of the gut and its microbiome in chronic diseases, led us to hypothesize that patients with PAH exhibit a distinct gut microbiome that contributes to, and predicts, the disease. Fecal microbiome of 18 type 1 PAH patients (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 57.4, SD 16.7 mm Hg) and 13 reference subjects were compared by shotgun metagenomics to evaluate this hypothesis. Significant taxonomic and functional changes in microbial communities in the PAH cohort were observed. Pathways for the synthesis of arginine, proline, and ornithine were increased in PAH cohort compared with reference cohort. Additionally, groups of bacterial communities associated with trimethylamine/ trimethylamine N-oxide and purine metabolism were increased in PAH cohort. In contrast, butyrate-and propionate-producing bacteria such as Coprococcus, Butyrivibrio, Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, Akkermansia, and Bacteroides were increased in reference cohort. A random forest model predicted PAH from the composition of the gut microbiome with 83% accuracy. Finally, virome analysis showed enrichment of Enterococcal and relative depletion of Lactococcal phages in the PAH cohort. In conclusion, patients with PAH exhibit a unique microbiome profile that has the high predictive potential for PAH. This highlights previously unknown roles of gut bacteria in this disease and could lead to new therapeutic, diagnostic, or management paradigms for PAH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gmrepo.humangut.info/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GMrepo&lt;/a&gt; (data repository for Gut Microbiota) is a database of curated and consistently annotated human gut metagenomes. Its main purpose is to facilitate the reusability and accessibility of the rapidly growing human metagenomic data. This is achieved by consistently annotating the microbial contents of collected samples using state-of-art toolsets and by manual curation of the meta-data of the corresponding human hosts. &lt;a href=&#34;https://gmrepo.humangut.info/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GMrepo&lt;/a&gt; organizes the collected samples according to their associated phenotypes and includes all possible related meta-data such as age, sex, country, body-mass-index (BMI) and recent antibiotics usage. To make relevant information easier to access, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gmrepo.humangut.info/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GMrepo&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a graphical query builder, enabling users to make customized, complex and biologically relevant queries. For example, to find (1) samples from healthy individuals of 18 to 25 years old with BMIs between 18.5 and 24.9, or (2) projects that are related to colorectal neoplasms, with each containing &amp;gt;100 samples and both patients and healthy controls. Precomputed species/genus relative abundances, prevalence within and across phenotypes, and pairwise co-occurrence information are all available at the website and accessible through programmable interfaces. So far, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gmrepo.humangut.info/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GMrepo&lt;/a&gt; contains 58 903 human gut samples/runs (including 17 618 metagenomes and 41 285 amplicons) from 253 projects concerning 92 phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wnt Signaling in 3D: Recent Advances in the Applications of Intestinal Organoids</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/31718893/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using organoid technology, adult epithelial stem cells can be expanded &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; to generate self-organizing 3D epithelial structures that closely recapitulate the architecture and cellular composition of the tissue of origin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of their strict dependence on Wnt ligands for survival and growth, intestinal organoids have become the tool of choice for &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; studies aimed at revealing mechanistic aspects of Wnt signaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adult stem cell- and patient-derived intestinal organoids can serve as a platform for investigating mutation-induced disease mechanisms. Insights into how specific mutations alter Wnt activity are becoming a key determinant for tailored therapeutic approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the rapid expansion of the organoid field and its applications, there is an increasing need for a standardized method to interpret organoid genotype–phenotype relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intestinal organoids grown from adult stem cells have emerged as prototype 3D organotypic models for studying tissue renewal and homeostasis. Owing to their strict dependence on Wnt signaling, intestinal organoids offer an unprecedented opportunity to examine Wnt pathway regulation in normal physiology and cancer. We review how alterations in growth factor dependency and organoid morphology can be exploited to identify Wnt signaling mechanisms, characterize mutated pathway components, and predict responses of patient-derived tumors to targeted therapy. We discuss current deficits in the understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships that are to be considered when interpreting mutation-induced changes in organoid morphology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long-Term Culture Captures Injury-Repair Cycles of Colonic Stem Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31708126/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colonic epithelium can undergo multiple rounds of damage and repair, often in response to excessive inflammation. The responsive stem cell that mediates this process is unclear, in part because of a lack of in vitro models that recapitulate key epithelial changes that occur in vivo during damage and repair. Here, we identify a Hopx&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; colitis-associated regenerative stem cell (CARSC) population that functionally contributes to mucosal repair in mouse models of colitis. Hopx&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CARSCs, enriched for fetal-like markers, transiently arose from hypertrophic crypts known to facilitate regeneration. Importantly, we established a long-term, self-organizing two-dimensional (2D) epithelial monolayer system to model the regenerative properties and responses of Hopx&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CARSCs. This system can reenact the &amp;ldquo;homeostasis-injury-regeneration&amp;rdquo; cycles of epithelial alterations that occur in vivo. Using this system, we found that hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum stress, insults commonly present in inflammatory bowel diseases, mediated the cyclic switch of cellular status in this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer type and a threat to human health. Tumor budding (TB) is the presence of a single cancer cell or clusters of up to five cancer cells prior to the invasive front of an aggressive carcinoma and is an independent prognosis factor for CRC. The molecular mechanism of TB is still unclear, and drugs that inhibit this process are still in the blank stage. This study found that TBs exhibit characteristics of partial EMT with a decreased expression of E-cadherin and no substantial differences in the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin. We also observed the interaction of integrin with extracellular matrix components, laminin-5γ2 (LN-5γ2), play essential roles in the TB of CRC. We then verified that the interaction between LN-5γ2 and integrin β1 promotes the TB of CRC via the activation of FAK and Yes-associated proteins (YAP). A natural drug monomer, cucurbitacin B, was screened using virtual screening methods for the interaction interface of proteins. We found that this monomer could block the interaction interface between LN-5γ2 and integrin β1 and substantially inhibit the TB of CRC cells via inactivation of YAP. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of TB mechanism and the development of drugs targeting the TB of CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Commensal viruses maintain intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes via noncanonical RIG-I signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31636462/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much attention has focused on commensal bacteria in health and disease, but the role of commensal viruses is understudied. Although metagenomic analysis shows that the intestine of healthy humans and animals harbors various commensal viruses and the dysbiosis of these viruses can be associated with inflammatory diseases, there is still a lack of causal data and underlying mechanisms to understand the physiological role of commensal viruses in intestinal homeostasis. In the present study, we show that commensal viruses are essential for the homeostasis of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Mechanistically, the cytosolic viral RNA-sensing receptor RIG-I in antigen-presenting cells can recognize commensal viruses and maintain IELs via a type I interferon-independent, but MAVS-IRF1-IL-15 axis-dependent, manner. The recovery of IELs by interleukin-15 administration reverses the susceptibility of commensal virus-depleted mice to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Collectively, our results indicate that commensal viruses maintain the IELs and consequently sustain intestinal homeostasis via noncanonical RIG-I signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enterovirus pathogenesis requires the host methyltransferase SETD3</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31527793/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enteroviruses (EVs) comprise a large genus of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses whose members cause a number of important and widespread human diseases, including poliomyelitis, myocarditis, acute flaccid myelitis and the common cold. How EVs co-opt cellular functions to promote replication and spread is incompletely understood. Here, using genome-scale CRISPR screens, we identify the actin histidine methyltransferase SET domain containing 3 (SETD3) as critically important for viral infection by a broad panel of EVs, including rhinoviruses and non-polio EVs increasingly linked to severe neurological disease such as acute flaccid myelitis (EV-D68) and viral encephalitis (EV-A71). We show that cytosolic SETD3, independent of its methylation activity, is required for the RNA replication step in the viral life cycle. Using quantitative affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we show that SETD3 specifically interacts with the viral 2A protease of multiple enteroviral species, and we map the residues in 2A that mediate this interaction. 2A mutants that retain protease activity but are unable to interact with SETD3 are severely compromised in RNA replication. These data suggest a role of the viral 2A protein in RNA replication beyond facilitating proteolytic cleavage. Finally, we show that SETD3 is essential for in vivo replication and pathogenesis in multiple mouse models for EV infection, including CV-A10, EV-A71 and EV-D68. Our results reveal a crucial role of a host protein in viral pathogenesis, and suggest targeting SETD3 as a potential mechanism for controlling viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multitude of factors contribute to complex diseases and can be measured with &amp;lsquo;omics&amp;rsquo; methods. Databases facilitate data interpretation for underlying mechanisms. Here, we describe the &lt;a href=&#34;www.vmh.life&#34;&gt;Virtual Metabolic Human (VMH)&lt;/a&gt; database encapsulating current knowledge of human metabolism within five interlinked resources &amp;lsquo;Human metabolism&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Gut microbiome&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Disease&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Nutrition&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;ReconMaps&amp;rsquo;. The &lt;a href=&#34;www.vmh.life&#34;&gt;VMH&lt;/a&gt; captures 5180 unique metabolites, 17 730 unique reactions, 3695 human genes, 255 Mendelian diseases, 818 microbes, 632 685 microbial genes and 8790 food items. The &lt;a href=&#34;www.vmh.life&#34;&gt;VMH&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s unique features are (i) the hosting of the metabolic reconstructions of human and gut microbes amenable for metabolic modeling; (ii) seven human metabolic maps for data visualization; (iii) a nutrition designer; (iv) a user-friendly webpage and application-programming interface to access its content; (v) user feedback option for community engagement and (vi) the connection of its entities to 57 other web resources. The &lt;a href=&#34;www.vmh.life&#34;&gt;VMH&lt;/a&gt; represents a novel, interdisciplinary database for data interpretation and hypothesis generation to the biomedical community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modelling Cryptosporidium infection in human small intestinal and lung organoids</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/29946163/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem-cell-derived organoids recapitulate in vivo physiology of their original tissues, representing valuable systems to model medical disorders such as infectious diseases. &lt;em&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/em&gt;, a protozoan parasite, is a leading cause of diarrhoea and a major cause of child mortality worldwide. Drug development requires detailed knowledge of the pathophysiology of &lt;em&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/em&gt;, but experimental approaches have been hindered by the lack of an optimal in vitro culture system. Here, we show that &lt;em&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/em&gt; can infect epithelial organoids derived from human small intestine and lung. The parasite propagates within the organoids and completes its complex life cycle. Temporal analysis of the &lt;em&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/em&gt; transcriptome during organoid infection reveals dynamic regulation of transcripts related to its life cycle. Our study presents organoids as a physiologically relevant in vitro model system to study &lt;em&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/em&gt; infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics and chemogenetics comprise a wide variety of applications in which genetically encoded actuators and indicators are used to modulate and monitor activity with high cellular specificity. Over the past 10 years, development of these genetically encoded tools has contributed tremendously to our understanding of integrated physiology. In concert with the continued refinement of probes, strategies to target transgene expression to specific cell types have also made much progress in the past 20 years. In addition, the successful implementation of optogenetic and chemogenetic techniques thrives thanks to ongoing advances in live imaging microscopy and optical technology. Although innovation of optogenetic and chemogenetic methods has been primarily driven by researchers studying the central nervous system, these techniques also hold great promise to boost research in neurogastroenterology. In this Review, we describe the different classes of tools that are currently available and give an overview of the strategies to target them to specific cell types in the gut wall. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of optogenetic and chemogenetic technology in the gut and provide an overview of their current use, with a focus on the enteric nervous system. Furthermore, we suggest some experiments that can advance our understanding of how the intrinsic and extrinsic neural networks of the gut control gastrointestinal function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Erratum in:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corrigendum: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016219&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Mouse Intestinal Bacterial Collection (miBC) provides host-specific insight into cultured diversity and functional potential of the gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intestinal bacteria influence mammalian physiology, but many types of bacteria are still uncharacterized. Moreover, reference strains of mouse gut bacteria are not easily available, although mouse models are extensively used in medical research. These are major limitations for the investigation of intestinal microbiomes and their interactions with diet and host. It is thus important to study in detail the diversity and functions of gut microbiota members, including those colonizing the mouse intestine. To address these issues, we aimed at establishing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dsmz.de/collection/catalogue/microorganisms/special-groups-of-organisms/dzif-sammlung/maus-mikrobiomliste&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mouse Intestinal Bacterial Collection (miBC)&lt;/a&gt;, a public repository of bacterial strains and associated genomes from the mouse gut, and studied host-specificity of colonization and sequence-based relevance of the resource. The collection includes several strains representing novel species, genera and even one family. Genomic analyses showed that certain species are specific to the mouse intestine and that a minimal consortium of 18 strains covered 50-75% of the known functional potential of metagenomes. The present work will sustain future research on microbiota-host interactions in health and disease, as it will facilitate targeted colonization and molecular studies.&lt;/p&gt;
