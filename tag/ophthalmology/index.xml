&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photoreception of ipRGCs mediates light modulation of glucose tolerance (GT) in mice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus is essential for light modulation of GT in mice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light modulates GT via a neuro circuit that alters adaptive thermogenesis in mice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light modulates human GT at the temperature where brown adipose tissue is active&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health studies indicate that artificial light is a high-risk factor for metabolic disorders. However, the neural mechanism underlying metabolic modulation by light remains elusive. Here, we found that light can acutely decrease glucose tolerance (GT) in mice by activation of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) innervating the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON). Vasopressin neurons in the SON project to the paraventricular nucleus, then to the GABAergic neurons in the solitary tract nucleus, and eventually to brown adipose tissue (BAT). Light activation of this neural circuit directly blocks adaptive thermogenesis in BAT, thereby decreasing GT. In humans, light also modulates GT at the temperature where BAT is active. Thus, our work unveils a retina-SON-BAT axis that mediates the effect of light on glucose metabolism, which may explain the connection between artificial light and metabolic dysregulation, suggesting a potential prevention and treatment strategy for managing glucose metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PANoptosis-like cell death in ischemia/reperfusion injury of retinal neurons</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened small molecules to identify two compounds, which we named RSL3 and RSL5, that have increased lethality in the presence of oncogenic RAS. Counter screening with biologically active compounds defined aspects of the mechanism of action for RSL3 and RSL5, such as a nonapoptotic, MEK-dependent, and iron-dependent oxidative cell death. Erastin, a previously reported compound with RAS-selective lethality, showed similar properties. RNA interference experiments targeting voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (VDAC3), a target of erastin, demonstrated that RSL5 is a scaffold that acts through VDACs to activate the observed pathway. RSL3 activated a similar death mechanism but in a VDAC-independent manner. We found that cells transformed with oncogenic RAS have increased iron content relative to their normal cell counterparts through upregulation of transferrin receptor 1 and downregulation of ferritin heavy chain 1 and ferritin light chain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Injectable double-network hydrogel for corneal repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/cej.2022.140698/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injuries to the cornea can cause corneal opacity or even blindness. Especially scald wounds and chemical burns to the cornea can usually lead to loss of corneal epithelium function and deep damage to the corneal stroma. Injectable hydrogel has been widely applied in corneal tissue engineering because it is easy to handle and can completely fill the defect area with minimally invasive surgical procedures. To reduce the risk and complications of penetrating keratoplasty and lamellar keratoplasty and to meet the demand for donated cornea, an injectable double-network (IDN) hydrogel based on methacrylated gelatin (Gel-MA) and oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA) was constructed for focal corneal defect repairing. The Gel-MA/OHA IDN hydrogel had an interconnected porous microstructure and tunable mechanical properties with a modulus between 3.4 and 176.4 kPa. The hydrogel could promote cell adhesion and proliferation and afford the sustained release of hydrophilic/hydrophobic drugs. &lt;em&gt;In-vivo&lt;/em&gt; corneal repair was performed by injecting the precursors into the pre-drilled epithelial-stromal defects of New Zealand White rabbits followed by immediate &lt;em&gt;in-situ&lt;/em&gt; UV crosslinking. The results showed that the hydrogel had a strong capacity to promote corneal regeneration. Optical coherence tomography, slip lamp, fluorescein staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and haematoxylin &amp;amp; eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining were employed to illustrate the effectiveness and safety of corneal tissue regeneration. All the results showed that the optimized Gel-MA/OHA IDN hydrogel possessed excellent biocompatibility and could promote cornea repair &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. This study suggests that the injectable biocompatible double network hydrogel may provide a good choice for corneal repair and regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Melanopsin retinal ganglion cells mediate light-promoted brain development</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light sensation through ipRGCs early in life promotes cortical synaptogenesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light enhances CSF oxytocin level via an ipRGCs-SON-PVN oxytocin neuron circuit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oxytocin is essential for light-promoted ipRGC-mediated synaptogenesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of light sensation in early development impairs learning ability in adult mice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During development, melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) become light sensitive much earlier than rods and cones. IpRGCs project to many subcortical areas, whereas physiological functions of these projections are yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that ipRGC-mediated light sensation promotes synaptogenesis of pyramidal neurons in various cortices and the hippocampus. This phenomenon depends on activation of ipRGCs and is mediated by the release of oxytocin from the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) into cerebral-spinal fluid. We further characterized a direct connection between ipRGCs and oxytocin neurons in the SON and mutual projections between oxytocin neurons in the SON and PVN. Moreover, we showed that the lack of ipRGC-mediated, light-promoted early cortical synaptogenesis compromised learning ability in adult mice. Our results highlight the importance of light sensation early in life on the development of learning ability and therefore call attention to suitable light environment for infant care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TNF-α stimulation enhances the neuroprotective effects of gingival MSCs derived exosomes in retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury via the MEG3/miR-21a-5p axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35378413/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the main pathogenic mechanisms of glaucoma, which are largely unknown, including neuroinflammation and neuronal death in the pathological process. In our previous studies, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to play anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective roles. Additionally, conditioned culture medium (CM) of MSCs stimulated by TNF-α have achieved better antiallergic effects in an experimental allergic conjunctivitis mouse model. However, there is an urgent need for cell-free therapy approaches, like exosomes, to reduce the side effects of autoimmunity. The present study aimed to elucidate the pathways involving TNF-α-stimulated gingival MSC (GMSC)-exosomes (TG-exos), in modulating inflammatory microglia and alleviating apoptosis. In this study, exosomes from the CM of GMSCs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and were injected into the vitreous of mice. The results showed that intraocular injection of TG-exos into mice with IRI notably reduced inflammation and cell loss than that with G-exos (GMSC-exosomes). Similar results were observed in vitro. Additionally, with the microRNA (miR) arrays, it was found that miR-21-5p acted as a crucial factor in TG-exos for neuroprotection and anti-inflammation. Following target prediction and dual-luciferase assay suggested that miR-21-5p played a role by combining with programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), which was regulated by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). This study demonstrates a new therapeutic pathway for neuroprotection against IRI by delivering miR-21-5p-enriched exosomes through MEG3/miR-21-5p/PDCD4 axis and paves the way for the establishment of a cell-free therapeutic approach for glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;
