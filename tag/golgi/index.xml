      <title>Precise Monitoring and Assessing Treatment Response of Sepsis-Induced Acute Lung Hypoxia with a Nitroreductase-Activated Golgi-Targetable Fluorescent Probe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is mostly attributed to an outbreak of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which makes leukocytes infiltrate into the lung and results in lung hypoxia. Nitroreductase (NTR) is significantly upregulated under hypoxia, which is commonly regarded as a potential biomarker for assessing sepsis-induced acute lung hypoxia. Increasing evidence shows that NTR in the Golgi apparatus could be induced in sepsis-induced ALI. Meanwhile, the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor (dimethyloxalylglycine, DMOG) attenuated sepsis-induced ALI through further increasing the level of Golgi NTR by improving hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activity, but as yet, no Golgi-targetable probe has been developed for monitoring and assessing treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI. Herein, we report a Golgi-targetable probe, Gol-NTR, for monitoring and assessing treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI through mapping the generation of NTR. The probe displayed high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 54.8 ng/mL and good selectivity to NTR. In addition, due to the excellent characteristics of Golgi-targetable, Gol-NTR was successfully applied in mapping the change of Golgi NTR in cells and zebrafish caused by various stimuli. Most importantly, the production of Golgi NTR in the sepsis-induced ALI and the PHD inhibitor (DMOG) against sepsis-induced ALI were visualized and precisely assessed for the first time with the assistance of Gol-NTR. The results demonstrated the practicability of Gol-NTR for the precise monitoring and assessing of the personalized treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Golgi-derived vesicle potentiates PtdIns4P to PtdIns3P conversion for endosome fission</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34183801/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endosome fission is essential for cargo sorting and targeting in the endosomal system. However, whether organelles other than the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) participate in endosome fission through membrane contacts is unknown. Here, we characterize a Golgi-derived vesicle, the SEC14L2 compartment, that plays a unique role in facilitating endosome fission through ternary contacts with endosomes and the ER. Localized to the ER-mediated endosome fission site, the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein SEC14L2 promotes phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) conversion before endosome fission. In the absence of SEC14L2, endosome fission is attenuated and more enlarged endosomes arise due to endosomal accumulation of PtdIns4P and reduction in PtdIns3P. Collectively, our data suggest roles of the Golgi network in ER-associated endosome fission and a mechanism involving ER-endosome contacts in the regulation of endosomal phosphoinositide conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Proteomics reveals distinct mechanisms regulating the release of cytokines and alarmins during pyroptosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major pathway for proinflammatory protein release by macrophages is inflammasome-mediated pyroptotic cell death. As conventional secretion, unconventional secretion, and cell death are executed simultaneously, however, the cellular mechanisms regulating this complex paracrine program remain incompletely understood. Here, we devise a quantitative proteomics strategy to define the cellular exit route for each protein by pharmacological and genetic dissection of cellular checkpoints regulating protein release. We report the release of hundreds of proteins during pyroptosis, predominantly due to cell lysis. They comprise constitutively expressed and transcriptionally induced proteins derived from the cytoplasm and specific intracellular organelles. Many low-molecular-weight proteins including the cytokine interleukin-1β, alarmins, and lysosomal-cargo proteins exit cells in the absence of cell lysis. Cytokines and alarmins are released in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi-dependent manner as free proteins rather than by extracellular vesicles. Our work provides an experimental framework for the dissection of cellular exit pathways and a resource for pyroptotic protein release.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Golgi Apparatus: An Emerging Platform for Innate Immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/32413316/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Golgi apparatus serves as a receiving station where proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are further processed before being sent to other cellular compartments. In addition to its well-appreciated roles in vesicular trafficking and protein/lipid secretion, recent studies have demonstrated that the Golgi acts as a signaling platform to facilitate multiple innate immune pathways. Moreover, the membranous networks that connect the Golgi with the ER, mitochondria, endosomes, and autophagosomes provide convenient access to innate immune signal transduction and subsequent effector responses. Here, we review the emerging knowledge about the roles of the Golgi in the initiation and activation of innate immune signaling. Moreover, microbial hijacking strategies that inhibit Golgi-associated innate immune responses will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
