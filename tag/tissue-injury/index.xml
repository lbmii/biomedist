      <title>AKT Phosphorylates FAM13A and Promotes Its Degradation via CUL4A/DDB1/DCAF1 E3 Complex</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within FAM13A gene are significantly associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung function in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, how FAM13A protein is regulated under physiological and pathological condition remains largely elusive. Herein, we report that FAM13A is phosphorylated at the Serine 312 residue by AKT kinase after cigarette smoke extract treatment and thereby recognized by the CULLIN4A/DCAF1 E3 ligase complex, rendering the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of FAM13A. More broadly, downregulation of FAM13A protein upon AKT activation, as a general cellular response to acute stress, was also detected in influenza- or naphthalene-injured lungs in mice. Functionally, reduced protein levels of FAM13A leads to accelerated epithelial cell proliferation in murine lungs during recovery phase after injury. In summary, we characterized a novel molecular mechanism that regulates the stability of FAM13A protein, which enables the fine-tuning of lung epithelial repair post injuries. These significant findings will expand our molecular understanding on the regulation of protein stability that may modulate lung epithelial repair implicated in the development of COPD and other lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CYB5R3 in type II alveolar epithelial cells protects against lung fibrosis by suppressing TGF-β1 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36749633/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type II alveolar epithelial cell (AECII) redox imbalance contributes to the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) - a deadly disease with restricted and limited treatment options. Here, we show that expression of membrane-bound cytochrome B5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3), an enzyme critical for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) heme iron redox state, is diminished in IPF AECII. Deficiency of CYB5R3 in AECII leads to sustained activation of the profibrotic factor TGF-β1 and increased susceptibility to lung fibrosis. We further show that CYB5R3 is a critical regulator of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and sGC-cGMP-protein kinase G axis that modulates activation of TGF-β1 signaling pathway. We demonstrate that sGC agonists (BAY 41-8543 and BAY 54-6544) are effective in reducing the pulmonary fibrotic outcomes of in vivo deficiency of CYB5R3 in AECII. Taken together, these results establish that CYB5R3 in AECII is required to maintain resilience against lung injury and fibrosis, and that therapeutic manipulation of sGC redox state could provide a basis for treating fibrotic conditions in the lung and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Release of extracellular superoxide dismutase into alveolar fluid protects against acute lung injury and inflammation in Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36749572/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Oxidative stress and inflammation play crucial role in pathogenesis of ARDS. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is abundant in the lung and is important enzymatic defense against superoxide. Human single nucleotide polymorphism in matrix binding region of EC-SOD leads to substitution of arginine to glycine at position 213 (R213G) and results in release of EC-SOD into alveolar fluid, without affecting enzyme activity. We hypothesized that R213G EC-SOD variant protects against lung injury and inflammation via blockade of neutrophil-recruitment in infectious model of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. After inoculation with MRSA, WT mice had impaired integrity of alveolar-capillary barrier and increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), while infected mice expressing R213G EC-SOD variant maintained the integrity of alveolar-capillary interface and had attenuated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. MRSA-infected mice expressing R213G EC-SOD variant also had attenuated neutrophil numbers in BALF and decreased expression of neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1 by the alveolar epithelial ATII cells, compared to the infected WT group. The decreased neutrophil numbers in R213G mice were not due to increased rate of apoptosis. Mice expressing R213G variant had differential effect on neutrophil functionality, - the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) but not myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were attenuated in comparison to WT controls. Despite having the same bacterial load in the lung as WT controls, mice expressing R213G EC-SOD variant were protected from extrapulmonary dissemination of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of lung resident mesenchymal stromal cells in the pathogenesis and repair of chronic lung disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36749355/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells are multipotent adult cells that can be extracted from numerous tissues, including the lungs. Lung-resident MSCs (LR-MSCs) are localised to perivascular spaces where they act as important regulators of pulmonary homeostasis, mediating the balance between lung injury/damage and repair processes. LR-MSCs support the integrity of the lung tissue via modulation of the immune response and release of trophic factors. However, in the context of chronic lung diseases, the ability of LR-MSCs to maintain pulmonary homeostasis and facilitate repair is diminished. In this setting, LR-MSC can contribute to the pathogenesis of disease, through their altered secretory and immunomodulatory properties. In addition, they are capable of differentiating into myofibroblasts, thereby contributing to the fibrotic aspects of numerous lung diseases. For example, in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a variety of factors can stimulate their differentiation into myofibroblasts including tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-(α), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, Hedgehog (HH), and Wingless/integrated (Wnt) signalling. Here, we review the current literature on the characterisation of LR-MSCs and describe their roles in pulmonary homeostasis/repair and in the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comparing Effectiveness and Safety of SGLT2 Inhibitors vs DPP-4 Inhibitors in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Varying Baseline HbA1c Levels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36745425/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Importance:&lt;/em&gt; Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy has been associated with cardiovascular benefits and a few adverse events; however, whether the comparative effectiveness and safety profiles vary with differences in baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To compare cardiovascular effectiveness and safety of treatment with SGLT2i vs dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (1) overall and (2) at varying baseline HbA1c levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design, setting, and participants:&lt;/em&gt; A new-user comparative effectiveness and safety research study was conducted among 144 614 commercially insured adults, initiating treatment with SGLT2i or DPP-4i and with a recorded T2D diagnosis at baseline and at least 1 HbA1c laboratory result recorded within 3 months before treatment initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interventions:&lt;/em&gt; The intervention consisted of the initiation of treatment with SGLT2i or DPP-4i.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main outcomes and measures:&lt;/em&gt; Primary outcomes were a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or all-cause death (modified major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE]) and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). Safety outcomes were hypovolemia, fractures, falls, genital infections, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute kidney injury (AKI), and lower-limb amputation. Incidence rate (IR) per 1000 person-years, hazard ratios (HR) and rate differences (RD) with their 95% CIs were estimated controlling for 128 covariates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 144 614 eligible adults (mean [SD] age, 62 [12.4] years; 54% male participants) with T2D initiating treatment with a SGLT2i (n = 60 523) or a DPP-4i (n = 84 091) were identified; 44 099 had an HbA1c baseline value of less than 7.5%, 52 986 between 7.5% and 9%, and 47 529 greater than 9%. Overall, 87 274 eligible patients were 1:1 propensity score-matched: 24 052 with HbA1c less than 7.5%; 32 290 with HbA1c between 7.5% and 9%; and 30 932 with HbA1c greater than 9% (to convert percentage of total hemoglobin to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01). The initiation of SGLT2i vs DPP-4i was associated with a reduction in the risk of modified MACE (IR per 1000 person-years 17.13 vs 20.18, respectively; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.95; RD, -3.02; 95% CI, -5.23 to -0.80) and HHF (IR per 1000 person-years 3.68 vs 8.08, respectively; HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.57; RD -4.37; 95% CI, -5.62 to -3.12) over a mean follow-up of 8 months, with no evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity across the HbA1c levels. Treatment with SGLT2i showed an increased risk of genital infections and DKA and a reduced AKI risk compared with DPP-4i. Findings were consistent by HbA1c levels, except for a more pronounced risk of genital infections associated with SGLT2i for HbA1c levels of 7.5% to 9% (IR per 1000 person-years 68.5 vs 22.8, respectively; HR, 3.10; 95% CI, 2.68-3.58; RD, 46.22; 95% CI, 40.54-51.90).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions and relevance:&lt;/em&gt; In this comparative effectiveness and safety research study among adults with T2D, SGLT2i vs DPP-4i treatment initiators had a reduced risk of modified MACE and HHF, an increased risk of genital infections and DKA, and a lower risk of AKI, regardless of baseline HbA1c.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrated Proteomics and Metabolomics Analysis to Explore the Amelioration Mechanisms of Rosa roxburghii Tratt Fruit Polyphenols on Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Lung Injury Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36745194/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is the main cause of death for the elderly and children due to its high morbidity and mortality rates. Plant-derived functional foods are becoming increasingly important to the healthcare and food industries for adjunctive and alternative treatments of ALI. Polyphenols have been regarded to be beneficial to the prevention and amelioration of ALI. Rosa roxburghii Tratt fruit polyphenols (RRTP) has potential to prevent ALI, but mechanism remains unclear. This study was set up to systematically analyze the RRTP extract active ingredients, comprehensively evaluate its protective effects via lung histopathological examination, protein concentration, and cytokines production in ALI mice induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and finally revealed alleviation mechanisms of the regulatory effects of RRTP by proteomics and metabolomics approach. The results demonstrated RRTP could synergistically exert significant preventive effects against ALI by notably ameliorating lung histopathological damage and pulmonary capillary permeability in ALI mice, inhibiting lung tissue inflammatory response and acute phase proteins and S-100 calcium binding proteins, suppressing excessive activation of complement and coagulation cascades, and regulating disordered lipids metabolism and amino acid metabolism. This study illustrated that RRTP has obvious advantages in ALI adjunctive therapy and revealed the complicated amelioration mechanisms, which provides a breakthrough for the development and demonstration of RRTP as a nutritional compound additive for complementary therapy of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis promotes functional recovery after spinal cord injury by regulating microglia/macrophage polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36739421/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammatory response is an essential part of secondary injury after spinal cord injury (SCI). During this period, the injury may be exacerbated through the release of a large number of inflammatory factors and the polarization of infiltrating macrophages and microglia towards M1. Ang-(1-7), mainly generated by Ang II via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), can specifically bind to the G protein-coupled receptor Mas (MasR) and plays an important role in regulating inflammation and alleviating oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We aimed to investigate whether activating the Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis in rats after SCI can regulate local neuroinflammation to achieve functional recovery and obtain its potential mechanism. MasR expression of bone marrow-derived macrophages was determined by Western blot. Immunofluorescence, Western blot, Flow cytometry, and RT-qPCR were applied to evaluate the polarization of Ang-(1-7) on macrophages and the regulation of inflammatory cytokines. Previous evaluation of the spinal cord and bladder after SCI was conducted by hematoxylin-eosin staining, Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score, inclined plate test, electrophysiology, and catwalk were used to evaluate the functional recovery of rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MasR expression increased in macrophages under inflammatory conditions and further elevated after Ang-(1-7) treatment. Both in vivo and in vitro results confirmed that Ang-(1-7) could regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines by down-regulating proinflammatory cytokines and up-regulating anti-inflammatory cytokines, and bias the polarization direction of microglia/macrophages to M2 phenotypic. After SCI, Ang-(1-7) administration in situ led to better histological and functional recovery in rats, and this recovery at least partly involved the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; As shown in our data, activating Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis can effectively improve the inflammatory microenvironment after spinal cord injury, promote the polarization of microglia/macrophages towards the M2 phenotype, and finally support the recovery of motor function. Therefore, we suggest using Ang-(1-7) as a feasible treatment strategy for spinal cord injury to minimize the negative consequences of the inflammatory microenvironment after spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LINC00355 mediates CTNNBIP1 promoter methylation and promotes ER stress-induced podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36738224/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) plays an important role in podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy. Wnt/β-catenin signaling modulates ER stress, yet the epigenetic regulation of β-catenin in ER stress and podocyte injury remains largely unknown. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that LINC00355 recruits EZH1 to the promoter region of CTNNBIP1 and trimethylates H3K4 to regulate ER-stress induced podocyte injury in DN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; LINC00355 is upregulated in podocytes and correlates with renal function decline in DN patients. LINC00355 localizes in the nucleus and exerts biological functions by directly binding EZH1, which epigenetically targets CTNNBIP1 through repressive trimethylation of H3K4 and activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling and ER stress. Further, we provide mechanistic evidences that LINC00355 recruits EZH1 to the promoter region of CTNNBIP1 and regulates ER-stress induced podocyte injury in DN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation and conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our data reveal a major role of LINC00355/EZH1/CTNNBIP1 network in triggering podocyte injury, providing new evidences for understanding the role of ER stress in DN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RNA-binding protein in degenerative joint diseases: a systematic review</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36746279/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RBPs play an important role in the regulation and expression of post-transcriptional genes by participating in RNA synthesis, translation, splicing, and transport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent studies have demonstrated that the regulation of ECM metabolism, autophagy, senescence and even cell death by RBPs is closely related to OA and IVDD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RBPs are expected to become a new target for the mechanism research and clinical treatment in joint degenerative diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which are conserved proteins comprising multiple intermediate sequences, can interact with proteins, messenger RNA (mRNA) of coding genes, and non-coding RNAs to perform different biological functions, such as the regulation of mRNA stability, selective polyadenylation, and the management of non-coding microRNA (miRNA) synthesis to affect downstream targets. This article will highlight the functions of RBPs, in degenerative joint diseases (intervertebral disc degeneration [IVDD] and osteoarthritis [OA]). It will reviews the latest advancements on the regulatory mechanism of RBPs in degenerative joint diseases, in order to understand the pathophysiology, early diagnosis and treatment of OA and IVDD from a new perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals liver injury induced by glyphosate in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Glyphosate (GLY), as the active ingredient of the most widely used herbicide worldwide, is commonly detected in the environment and living organisms, including humans. Its toxicity and carcinogenicity in mammals remain controversial. Several studies have demonstrated the hepatotoxicity of GLY; however, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), immunofluorescent staining, and in vivo animal studies, we analyzed the liver tissues from untreated and GLY-treated mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We generated the first scRNA-seq atlas of GLY-exposed mouse liver. GLY induced varied cell composition, shared or cell-type-specific transcriptional alterations, and dysregulated cell-cell communication and thus exerted hepatotoxicity effects. The oxidative stress and inflammatory response were commonly upregulated in several cell types. We also observed activation and upregulated phagocytosis in macrophages, as well as proliferation and extracellular matrix overproduction in hepatic stellate cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study provides a comprehensive single-cell transcriptional picture of the toxic effect of GLY in the liver, which offers novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of the GLY-associated hepatotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Benefit of Flow-Controlled Over Pressure-Regulated Volume Control Mode During One-Lung Ventilation: A Randomized Experimental Crossover Study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36729097/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Application of a ventilation modality that ensures adequate gas exchange during one-lung ventilation (OLV) without inducing lung injury is of paramount importance. Due to its beneficial effects on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange, flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) may be considered as a protective alternative mode of traditional pressure- or volume-controlled ventilation during OLV. We investigated whether this new modality provides benefits compared with conventional ventilation modality for OLV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Ten pigs were anaesthetized and randomly assigned in a crossover design to be ventilated with FCV or pressure-regulated volume control (PRVC) ventilation. Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon dioxide (PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ventilation and hemodynamical parameters, and lung aeration measured by electrical impedance tomography were assessed at baseline and 1 hour after the application of each modality during OLV using an endobronchial blocker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared to PRVC, FCV resulted in increased Pao2 (153.7 ± 12.7 vs 169.9 ± 15.0 mm Hg; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .002) and decreased Paco2 (53.0 ± 11.0 vs 43.2 ± 6.0 mm Hg; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001) during OLV, with lower respiratory elastance (103.7 ± 9.5 vs 77.2 ± 10.5 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/L; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001) and peak inspiratory pressure values (27.4 ± 1.9 vs 22.0 ± 2.3 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001). No differences in lung aeration or hemodynamics could be detected between the 2 ventilation modalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The application of FCV in OLV led to improvement in gas exchange and respiratory elastance with lower ventilatory pressures. Our findings suggest that FCV may offer an optimal, protective ventilation modality for OLV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Efficacy and Safety of Balloon Pulmonary Angioplasty for Patients With Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension and Comorbid Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36734336/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36734336/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is a promising treatment modality for nonoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). However, BPA for atypical CTEPH with concurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains controversial owing to the risk of exacerbation of ventilation-perfusion mismatch. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BPA for CTEPH with moderate or severe COPD. Methods and Results Data from 149 patients with CTEPH, who underwent BPA from March 2011 to June 2021, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided based on COPD comorbidity: the COPD group (n=32, defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity &amp;lt;70% and forced expiratory volume in 1 second &amp;lt;80% predicted) and the non-COPD group (n=101); patients with mild COPD (n=16) were excluded. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were compared between the groups. Hemodynamics improved similarly in both groups (reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance): -55.6±29.0% (COPD group) and -58.9±21.4% (non-COPD group); &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=nonsignificant. Respiratory function and oxygenation improved in the COPD group (forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity [61.8±7.0% to 66.5±10.2%, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.02] and arterial oxygen partial pressure [60.9±10.6 mm Hg to 69.3±13.6 mm Hg, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.01]). Higher vital capacity (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.024) and higher diffusing capacity for lung carbon monoxide (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.028) at baseline were associated with greater improvement in oxygenation in the multivariable linear analysis. Lung injury per BPA session was 1.6% in the COPD group. Conclusions The efficacy and safety of BPA for nonoperable CTEPH in patients with comorbid COPD were similar to those in patients without COPD. Oxygenation and forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity improved in patients with COPD. BPA should be considered in patients with CTEPH with concurrent COPD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What Is New?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the first study to focus on balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) for atypical chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) with concurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The efficacy and safety of BPA in patients with COPD were similar to those in patients without COPD; hemodynamics nearly normalized despite comorbid COPD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPA improved oxygenation and forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity without exacerbation of the ventilation‐perfusion mismatch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What Are the Clinical Implications?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most patients with stable COPD do not have pulmonary hypertension or exhibit mild pulmonary hypertension; therefore, factors related to CTEPH contribute considerably to pulmonary hypertension in patients with CTEPH and concurrent COPD. BPA could be considered as an effective and safe treatment method for these patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moderate‐to‐severe COPD is one of the causes of nonoperability of CTEPH even if the type is deemed operable, However, BPA can be safely performed in CTEPH with moderate‐to‐severe COPD because it is minimally invasive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Lung epithelial cell-derived C3 protects against pneumonia-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36735773/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lung protection by local complement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complement proteins are innate immune defense molecules that protect the host against pathogenic microorganisms. The activities of the C3 component of complement are mostly attributed to circulating C3 primarily synthesized by hepatocytes. Sahu and Ozantürk et al. used mouse models of conditional gene deletion to investigate the contribution of local C3 protein production in the lung to protecting the pulmonary mucosal surface from cell damage caused by &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; infection. Mice lacking C3 only in lung epithelial cells exhibited more pronounced acute lung injury than control mice even so circulating C3 levels were maintained at near-normal levels by maintenance of liver C3 production. These findings point to lung epithelial cell-intrinsic protective functions provided by C3 as an essential contributor to first-line defense against bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complement component C3 is a fundamental plasma protein for host defense, produced largely by the liver. However, recent work has demonstrated the critical importance of tissue-specific C3 expression in cell survival. Here, we analyzed the effects of local versus peripheral sources of C3 expression in a model of acute bacterial pneumonia induced by &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. Whereas mice with global C3 deficiency had severe pneumonia-induced lung injury, those deficient only in liver-derived C3 remained protected, comparable to wild-type mice. Human lung transcriptome analysis showed that secretory epithelial cells, such as club cells, express high levels of C3 mRNA. Mice with tamoxifen-induced C3 gene ablation from club cells in the lung had worse pulmonary injury compared with similarly treated controls, despite maintaining normal circulating C3 levels. Last, in both the mouse pneumonia model and cultured primary human airway epithelial cells, we showed that stress-induced death associated with C3 deficiency parallels that seen in Factor B deficiency rather than C3a receptor deficiency. Moreover, C3-mediated reduction in epithelial cell death requires alternative pathway component Factor B. Thus, our findings suggest that a pathway reliant on locally derived C3 and Factor B protects the lung mucosal barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Minimizing Lung Injury During Laparoscopy in Head-Down Tilt: A Physiological Cohort Study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36729514/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Increased intra-abdominal pressure during laparoscopy induces atelectasis. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can alleviate atelectasis but may cause hyperinflation. Cyclic opening of collapsed alveoli and hyperinflation can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury and postoperative pulmonary complications. We aimed to study the effect of PEEP on atelectasis, lung stress, and hyperinflation during laparoscopy in the head-down (Trendelenburg) position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; An open-label, repeated-measures, interventional, physiological cohort trial was designed. All participants were recruited from a single tertiary Belgian university hospital. Twenty-three nonobese patients scheduled for laparoscopy in the Trendelenburg position were recruited.We applied a decremental PEEP protocol: 15 (high), 10 and 5 (low) cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Atelectasis was studied with the lung ultrasound score, the end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure, the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fraction of inspired oxygen concentration (Pao2/Fio2) ratio, and the dynamic respiratory system compliance. Global hyperinflation was evaluated by dead space volume, and regional ventilation was evaluated by lung ultrasound. Lung stress was estimated using the transpulmonary driving pressure and dynamic compliance. Data are reported as medians (25th-75th percentile).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; At 15, 10, and 5 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O PEEP, the respective measurements were: lung ultrasound scores (%) 11 (0-22), 27 (11-39), and 53 (42-61) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001); end-expiratory transpulmonary pressures (cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) 0.9 (-0.6 to 1.7), -0.3 (-2.0 to 0.7), and -1.9 (-4.6 to -0.9) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001); Pao2/Fio2 ratios (mm Hg) 471 (435-538), 458 (410-537), and 431 (358-492) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001); dynamic respiratory system compliances (mL/cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) 32 (26-36), 30 (25-34), and 27 (22-30) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001); driving pressures (cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) 8.2 (7.5-9.5), 9.3 (8.5-11.1), and 11.0 (10.3-12.2) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001); and alveolar dead space ventilation fractions (%) 10 (9-12), 10 (9-12), and 9 (8-12) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .23). The lung ultrasound score was similar between apical and basal lung regions at each PEEP level (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .76, .37, and .76, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Higher PEEP levels during laparoscopy in the head-down position facilitate lung-protective ventilation. Atelectasis and lung stress are reduced in the absence of global alveolar hyperinflation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil extracellular trap-associated carbamylation and histones trigger osteoclast formation in rheumatoid arthritis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36737106/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36737106/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective: Neutrophil infiltration into the synovial joint is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a disease characterised by progressive bone erosion. However, the mechanisms by which neutrophils participate in bone destruction remain unclear. Carbamylation is a posttranslational modification linked to increased bone erosion in RA and we previously showed that carbamylation is present in RA neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). However, it remains unclear whether NETs and their carbamylated protein cargo directly promote bone destruction and alter osteoclast biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: NETs and carbamylated NETs (cNETs) were assessed for their capacity to induce osteoclast formation in CD14+ monocytes. Chemical inhibitors and neutralising antibodies were used to elucidate the pathway by which NETs induce osteoclastogenesis. &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1*04:01&lt;/em&gt; mice received intra-articular injection of cNETs for 4 weeks. Joints were isolated and assessed for osteoclast formation. Plasma and synovial fluid samples from patients with RA (n=32) were assessed for the presence of carbamylated histone, and correlations to disease specific outcomes were performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: We found that NETs, when cNETs, instruct monocytes to undergo rapid osteoclast formation. NET-mediated osteoclastogenesis appears to depend on Toll-like receptor 4 signalling and NET-associated proteins including histones and neutrophil elastase. In vivo, we identified that the number of osteoclasts increased following immunisation with cNETs in &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1*04:01&lt;/em&gt; transgenic mice. Furthermore, carbamylated histones are increased in plasma and synovial fluid from patients with RA and correlate with active bone resorption and inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our results suggest that NETs have a direct role in RA-associated bone erosion by promoting osteoclast formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sesamin Induces the Transdifferentiation of Type II Alveolar Epithelial Cells via AnnexinA1 and TRPV1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36735045/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) with high rates of morbidity is often accompanied by the apoptosis in the type I alveolar epithelial cells (ATIs). Thus, the transdifferentiation of type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATIIs) into ATIs is crucial for the maintenance of alveolar epithelial functions. We aimed to elucidate the role of sesamin in the transdifferentiation of ATIIs to ATIs and the involvement of the TRPV1/AKT pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In vivo, the mouse model of ALI was simulated by intraperitoneal and intratracheal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. The protective effects of sesamin on ALI were investigated using the survival rate, lung/body weight ratio, histological analysis of lung with HE staining, and mRNA levels of inflammatory factors. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence detection of ATIs marker AQP5 were used to evaluate the protective effect of sesamin on ATIs. Western blot, EdU, and qPCR analyses were applied to detect changes in apoptosis, proliferation, and transdifferentiation markers of ATII A549 cell lines. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to detect the involvement and relationships between the sesamin receptors (ANXA1 and TRPV1) and the AKT pathway in transdifferentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Sesamin (200 mg/kg) significantly improved LPS-induced ALI and inhibited LPS-induced ATIs reduction. A low concentration of sesamin (20 μM) promoted the transdifferentiation of ATIIs to ATIs. Both ANXA1 and TRPV1 were involved in sesamin-promoted transdifferentiation, while the P-AKT (S473) level was down-regulated by TRPV1 siRNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Sesamin may promote transdifferentiation of ATII to ATI to ultimately rescue ALI, with TRPV1/AKT pathway involved in this transdifferentiation. This study revealed a novel role of sesamin in promoting the transdifferentiation of ATIIs to ATIs, providing experimental supports for the potential targets of ALI therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury is a major cause of death in sepsis. Tofacitinib (TOFA), a JAK inhibitor, has anti-inflammatory activity in autoimmune diseases, but its role in acute lung injury in sepsis remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to establish a septic rat model by cecal ligation and perforation, and to evaluate the effect of tofacitinib on the survival rate of septic rat model and its role in acute lung injury in septic rats and the possible mechanism of action. In this study, TOFA (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg) was used to observe the survival rate of septic rats. It was found that TOFA (10 mg/kg) significantly improved the survival rate of septic rats. We selected TOFA (10 mg/kg) and focused on the protective effect of TOFA on acute lung injury. The results confirmed that TOFA significantly inhibited the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ inflammatory factors, reduced the W/D weight ratio of septic lung tissue, and significantly improved lung histopathological damage. These results may be related to the inhibitory effect of TOFA on JAK-STAT/NF-κ B signaling pathway. In conclusion, for the first time, we found that TOFA has a protective effect against sepsis-induced acute lung injury, and it may be a promising drug for the treatment of acute lung injury in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Thrombin-Activated Peptide-Templated Nanozyme for Remedying Ischemic Stroke Via Thrombolytic and Neuroprotective Actions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the most common causes of disability and death. Thrombolysis and neuroprotection are two current major therapeutic strategies to overcome the ischemic and reperfusion damages. Here, we have designed a novel peptide-templated MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanozyme (PNzyme/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that integrates the thrombolytic activity of the functional peptides with the ROS scavenging ability of the nanozyme. Through the self-assembled polypeptides that contains multiple functional motifs, the novel peptide-templated nanozyme is able to bind fibrin in the thrombus, cross blood brain barrier, and finally accumulate in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &amp;ldquo;switch-on&amp;rdquo; by the action of thrombin. In mice and rat IS models, the PNzyme/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; prolonged blood circulation time and exhibited strong thrombolytic action, and reduced the ischemic damages in brain tissues. Moreover, this peptide-templated nanozyme also effectively inhibited the activation of astrocytes and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These data indicated that rationally designed PNzyme/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanozyme exerts both thrombolytic and neuroprotective actions. Giving its long half-life in the blood and ability to target brain thrombi, the biocompatible nanozyme may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to improve the efficacy and prevent secondary thrombosis during the treatment of IS.

      <title>Carnosic acid inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation by targeting both priming and assembly steps</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36738671/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA specifically inhibits the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in murine and human macrophages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA blocks the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by suppressing ROS production and interrupting the NLRP3-NEK7 interaction as well as subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA ameliorates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute systemic inflammation and MSU-induced peritonitis in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In summary, CA acts as an NLRP3 potent inhibitor and exerts the potential application in NLRP3-driven diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carnosic acid (CA) is a polyphenolic diterpene from rosemary extract with anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities. Numerous reports have focused on its anti-tumor ability, while the exact mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammation remains unclear. Here, we have identified that CA is a potent inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro and in vivo. CA not only reduces NLRP3 expression by blocking NF-κB activation, but also inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation by suppressing mitochondrial ROS production and interrupting NLRP3-NEK7 interaction. Furthermore, in mouse models, CA alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute systemic inflammation and MSU-induced peritonitis via NLRP3. Taken together, our data demonstrated the inhibitory effect of CA on NLRP3 inflammasome and pointed out the potential application of CA in the treatment of NLRP3-driven diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genome-wide Association Study in Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36749126/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) is a rare immune related disease, accounting for about 10% of cases of unexplained acute kidney injury (AKI). Previous elucidation of the relationship between genetic factors that contribute to its pathogenesis was hampered due to small sample sizes and candidate gene design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We undertook the first two-stage genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analysis involving 544 kidney biopsy-defined cases of ATIN and 2,346 controls with Chinese ancestry. We conducted statistical fine-mapping analysis, provided functional annotations of significant variants, estimated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability, and checked genotype and sub-phenotype correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Two genome-wide significant loci, rs35087390 of HLA-DQA1 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;= 3.01×10&lt;sup&gt;-39&lt;/sup&gt;) on 6p21.32 and rs2417771 of PLEKHA5 on 12p12.3 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 2.14×10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt;), emerged from the analysis. HLA imputation using two reference panels suggested that HLA-DRB1-14 mainly drives the HLA risk association. HLA-DRB1 residue 60 belonging to pockets P10 was the key amino acid position. The SNP-based heritability estimates with and without the HLA locus were 20.43% and 10.35%. Different clinical sub-phenotypes (drug-related or tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome) seemed to share the same risk alleles. But HLA risk genotype was associated with disease severity and response rate to immunosuppressive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We identified two candidate genome regions associated with susceptibility to ATIN. The findings suggest that a genetically conferred risk of immune dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of ATIN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrative in situ mapping of single-cell transcriptional states and tissue histopathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer&#39;s disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36732642/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex diseases are characterized by spatiotemporal cellular and molecular changes that may be difficult to comprehensively capture. However, understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying pathology can shed light on disease mechanisms and progression. Here we introduce STARmap PLUS, a method that combines high-resolution spatial transcriptomics with protein detection in the same tissue section. As proof of principle, we analyze brain tissues of a mouse model of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease at 8 and 13 months of age. Our approach provides a comprehensive cellular map of disease progression. It reveals a core-shell structure where disease-associated microglia (DAM) closely contact amyloid-β plaques, whereas disease-associated astrocyte-like (DAA-like) cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are enriched in the outer shells surrounding the plaque-DAM complex. Hyperphosphorylated tau emerges mainly in excitatory neurons in the CA1 region and correlates with the local enrichment of oligodendrocyte subtypes. The STARmap PLUS method bridges single-cell gene expression profiles with tissue histopathology at subcellular resolution, providing a tool to pinpoint the molecular and cellular changes underlying pathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The STARmap PLUS sequencing data are available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP1375&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Single-Cell Portal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7332091&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Zenodo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio as a prognostic marker of mortality and disease severity in septic Acute kidney injury Patients: A retrospective study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36738677/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36738677/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of sepsis associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been shown as a risk factor for septic AKI. In this study, we aimed to further evaluate NLR&amp;rsquo;s prediction value on the prognosis of septic AKI patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Septic AKI patients at a tertiary university-affiliated medical center were retrospectively enrolled from August 2015 to August 2021. The primary outcomes were 30-day and 90-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were disease severity, length of stay, and rehospitalization in survivors. Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards, cubic spline and logistics regression analyses were performed for adverse outcomes basing on NLR. The predictive value of NLR on morality was also estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 309 septic AKI patients were included with a mean age of 57.8 ± 18.1 years and 92 (29.8 %) being female. The 30-day mortality was 43.4 % and 90-day morality was 61.8 %. When divided by the median of NLR at hospital admission, patients in the high NLR group were associated with an increased 30-day/90-day mortality. After adjusting for multiple covariates, the predictive value of NLR remained significant for 30-day mortality (HR: 2.96, 95 % CI: 1.48-5.92, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002) and 90-day mortality (HR: 1.88, 95 % CI: 1.11-3.16, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.018). NLR at admission had the highest AUROC (0.618) for 30-day mortality compared with other parameters such as white blood cell (0.573), neutrophil (0.579), lymphocyte (0.567), platelet (0.546), BUN (0.580), albumin (0.545), C-reactive protein (0.571) and procalcitonin (0.534). A similar predictive value on mortality was also observed for NLR measured at septic AKI diagnosis. For secondary outcomes, high NLR was associated with increased risk of transfer to ICU, mechanical ventilation, stage-3 AKI and renal replacement therapy, but not with length of hospital/ICU stay or long-term rehospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; High NLR is independently associated with 30-day/90-day mortality and disease severity in septic AKI patients. NLR may serve as an economic and widely available biomarker of septic AKI prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron recycling prevents the development of anemia under homeostatic conditions. Whether iron recycling was co-opted as a defense strategy to prevent the development of anemia in response to infection is unclear. We find that in severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the onset of life-threatening anemia is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), irrespective of parasite load. Using a well-established experimental rodent model of malaria anemia, we identify a transcriptional response that endows renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) with the capacity to store and recycle iron during P. chabaudi chabaudi (Pcc) infection. This response encompasses the induction of ferroportin 1/SLC40A1, which exports iron from RPTECs and counteracts AKI while supporting compensatory erythropoiesis and preventing the onset of life-threatening malarial anemia. Iron recycling by myeloid cells is dispensable to this protective response, suggesting that RPTECs provide an iron-recycling salvage pathway that prevents the pathogenesis of life-threatening malarial anemia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>G9a/GLP Targeting Ameliorates Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36724371/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by progressive vascular remodeling of small pulmonary arteries (PAs) causing sustained elevation of PA pressure, right ventricular failure and death. Similar to cancer cells, PA smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), which play a key role in pulmonary vascular remodeling, have adopted multiple mechanisms to sustain their survival and proliferation in the presence of stress. The histone methyltransferase G9a and its partner protein GLP have been shown to exert oncogenic effects and to serve as a buffer against an exaggerated transcriptional response. Therefore, we hypothesized that up-regulation of G9a/GLP in PAH plays a pivotal role in pulmonary vascular remodeling by maintaining the abnormal phenotype of PAH-PASMCs. We found that G9a is increases in PASMCs from PAH patients as well as in remodeled PAs from animal models. Pharmacological inhibition of G9a/GLP activity using BIX01294 and UNC0642 significantly reduced the pro-survival and pro-proliferative potentials of cultured PAH-PASMCs. Using RNA sequencing, further exploration revealed that G9a/GLP promotes extracellular matrix production and affords protection against the negative effects of an overactive stress response. Finally, we found that therapeutic treatment with BIX01294 reduced pulmonary vascular remodeling and lowered mean PA pressure in Fawn-Hooded rats. Treatment of Sugen/hypoxia-challenged mice with BIX01294 also improved pulmonary hemodynamics and right ventricular function. In conclusion, these findings indicate that G9a/GLP inhibition may represent a new therapeutic approach in PAH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USP25 Ameliorates Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy by Stabilizing SERCA2a in Cardiomyocytes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36722348/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pathological cardiac hypertrophy can lead to heart failure and is one of the leading causes of death globally. Understanding the molecular mechanism of pathological cardiac hypertrophy will contribute to the treatment of heart failure. DUBs (deubiquitinating enzymes) are essential to cardiac pathophysiology by precisely controlling protein function, localization, and degradation. This study set out to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of a DUB, USP25 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 25), in pathological cardiac hypertrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The role of USP25 in myocardial hypertrophy was evaluated in murine cardiomyocytes in response to Ang II (angiotensin II) and transverse aortic constriction stimulation and in hypertrophic myocardium tissues of heart failure patients. Liquid chromotography with mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis combined with Co-IP was used to identify SERCA2a (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2A), an antihypertrophy protein, as an interacting protein of USP25. To clarify the molecular mechanism of USP25 in the regulation of SERCA2a, we constructed a series of mutant plasmids of USP25. In addition, we overexpressed USP25 and SERCA2a in the heart with adenoassociated virus serotype 9 vectors to validate the biological function of USP25 and SERCA2a interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We revealed increased protein level of USP25 in murine cardiomyocytes subject to Ang II and transverse aortic constriction stimulation and in hypertrophic myocardium tissues of patients with heart failure. USP25 deficiency aggravated cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction under Ang II and transverse aortic constriction treatment. Mechanistically, USP25 bound to SERCA2a directly via its USP (ubiquitin-specific protease) domain and cysteine at position 178 of USP25 exerts deubiquitination to maintain the stability of the SERCA2a protein by removing the K48 ubiquitin chain and preventing proteasomal pathway degradation, thereby maintaining calcium handling in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, restoration of USP25 expression via adenoassociated virus serotype 9 vectors in USP25-/- mice attenuated Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction, whereas myocardial overexpression of SERCA2a could mimic the effect of USP25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We confirmed that USP25 inhibited cardiac hypertrophy by deubiquitinating and stabilizing SERCA2a.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convergence of diverse CMT2-causing mutant proteins in SG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutant proteins enter SGs and aberrantly interact with G3BP upon stress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aberrant G3BP interactions perturb the SG network and cause stress vulnerability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SG-mediated molecular interplay between genetic and environmental pathways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex diseases often involve the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 neuropathies (CMT2) are a group of genetically heterogeneous disorders, in which similar peripheral neuropathology is inexplicably caused by various mutated genes. Their possible molecular links remain elusive. Here, we found that upon environmental stress, many CMT2-causing mutant proteins adopt similar properties by entering stress granules (SGs), where they aberrantly interact with G3BP and integrate into SG pathways. For example, glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) is translocated from the cytoplasm into SGs upon stress, where the mutant GlyRS perturbs the G3BP-centric SG network by aberrantly binding to G3BP. This disrupts SG-mediated stress responses, leading to increased stress vulnerability in motoneurons. Disrupting this aberrant interaction rescues SG abnormalities and alleviates motor deficits in CMT2D mice. These findings reveal a stress-dependent molecular link across diverse CMT2 mutants and provide a conceptual framework for understanding genetic heterogeneity in light of environmental stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Notoginsenoside R1 protects against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice via suppressing TAK1-JNK/p38 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36721009/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies show that notoginsenoside R1 (NG-R1), a novel saponin isolated from Panax notoginseng, protects kidney, intestine, lung, brain and heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury. In this study we investigated the cardioprotective mechanisms of NG-R1 in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury in vivo and in vitro. MI/R injury was induced in mice by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by 4 h reperfusion. The mice were treated with NG-R1 (25 mg/kg, i.p.) every 2 h for 3 times starting 30 min prior to ischemic surgery. We showed that NG-R1 administration significantly decreased the myocardial infarction area, alleviated myocardial cell damage and improved cardiac function in MI/R mice. In murine neonatal cardiomyocytes (CMs) subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro, pretreatment with NG-R1 (25 μM) significantly inhibited apoptosis. We revealed that NG-R1 suppressed the phosphorylation of transforming growth factor β-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1), JNK and p38 in vivo and in vitro. Pretreatment with JNK agonist anisomycin or p38 agonist P79350 partially abolished the protective effects of NG-R1 in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of TAK1 greatly ameliorated H/R-induced apoptosis of CMs, and NG-R1 pretreatment did not provide further protection in TAK1-silenced CMs under H/R injury. Overexpression of TAK1 abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of NG-R1 and diminished the inhibition of NG-R1 on JNK/p38 signaling in MI/R mice as well as in H/R-treated CMs. Collectively, NG-R1 alleviates MI/R injury by suppressing the activity of TAK1, subsequently inhibiting JNK/p38 signaling and attenuating cardiomyocyte apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rapidly Blocking the Calcium Overload/ROS Production Feedback Loop to Alleviate Acute Kidney Injury via Microenvironment-Responsive BAPTA-AM/BAC Co-Delivery Nanosystem</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36719986/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcium overload and ROS overproduction, two major triggers of acute kidney injury (AKI), are self-amplifying and mutually reinforcing, forming a complicated cascading feedback loop that induces kidney cell &amp;ldquo;suicide&amp;rdquo; and ultimately renal failure. There are currently no clinically effective drugs for the treatment of AKI, excluding adjuvant therapy. In this study, a porous silicon-based nanocarrier rich in disulfide bond skeleton (&amp;lt;50 nm) is developed that enables efficient co-loading of the hydrophilic drug borane amino complex and the hydrophobic drug BAPTA-AM, with its outer layer sealed by the renal tubule-targeting peptide PEG-LTH. Once targeted to the kidney injured site, the nanocarrier structure collapses in the high glutathione environment of the early stage of AKI, releasing the drugs. Under the action of the slightly acidic inflammatory environment and intracellular esterase, the released drugs produce hydrogen and BAPTA, which can rapidly eliminate the excess ROS and overloaded Ca2+ , blocking endoplasmic reticulum/mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (ATF4-CHOP-Bax axis, Casp-12-Casp-3 axis, Cyt-C-Casp-3 axis) and inflammatory pathway (TNF-α-NF-κB axis) from the source, thus rescuing the renal cells in the &amp;ldquo;critical survival&amp;rdquo; state and further restoring the kidney function. Overall, this nanoparticle shows substantial clinical promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for I/R injury-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Mouse Model of Spinal Cord Hypoperfusion with Immediate Paralysis Caused by Endovascular Repair of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36716430/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; A clinically relevant mouse model of thoracic endovascular aortic repair-induced ischemic spinal cord injury has been lacking since the procedure was first employed in 1991. We hypothesized that ligation of mouse intercostal arteries would simulate thoracic endovascular aortic repair-induced ischemic spinal cord injury and behavioral deficit. We aimed to create a mouse model of thoracic endovascular aortic repair-induced spinal cord hypoperfusion by ligating five pairs of mouse intercostal vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mice were divided into sham (n=53) and ligation (n=60) groups. We double ligated three pairs and single ligated two pairs of thoracic intercostal arteries in adult C57BL/6 mice. A laser doppler probe was used in vivo on the spinal cords and intercostal arteries to document the extent of arterial ligation and spinal cord hypoperfusion. The Basso Mouse Scale for Locomotion, histological studies, and electron microscopy demonstrated post-ligation locomotive and histopathological changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Ligation induced a significant and instantaneous drop in blood flow in the intercostal arteries (% change) (mean=-63.81, 95%CI: -72.28 to -55.34) and the thoracic spinal cord (% change) (mean=-68.55, 95%CI: -80.23 to -56.87).Paralysis onset was immediate and of varying degree, with behavioral deficit stratified into three groups: 9.4% exhibited severe paralysis, 37.5% moderate paralysis, and 53.1% mild paralysis at day 1 (n=32; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Mild and moderate paralysis was transient, gradually improving over time. Severe paralysis showed no improvement and exhibited a higher mortality rate (83%; n=15/18) compared to moderately (33%; n=6/18) and mildly (24%; n=6/25) paralyzed mice (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The overall ligation group survival rate (84%; n=46/55) was significantly lower than the sham group (100%; n=48/48) with &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our mouse model generates reproducible spinal cord hypoperfusion and accompanying histopathological ischemic spinal cord damage. The resulting anatomical changes and variable behavioral deficits mimic the variability in radiological and clinical findings in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FTO-dependent m6A modification of Plpp3 in circSCMH1-regulated vascular repair and functional recovery following stroke</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36717587/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular repair is considered a key restorative measure to improve long-term outcomes after ischemic stroke. N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A), the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic mRNAs, functionally mediates vascular repair. However, whether circular RNA SCMH1 (circSCMH1) promotes vascular repair by m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation after stroke remains to be elucidated. Here, we identify the role of circSCMH1 in promoting vascular repair in peri-infarct cortex of male mice and male monkeys after photothrombotic (PT) stroke, and attenuating the ischemia-induced m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation in peri-infarct cortex of male mice after PT stroke. Mechanically, circSCMH1 increased the translocation of ubiquitination-modified fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) into nucleus of endothelial cells (ECs), leading to m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A demethylation of phospholipid phosphatase 3 (Plpp3) mRNA and subsequently the increase of Plpp3 expression in ECs. Our data demonstrate that circSCMH1 enhances vascular repair via FTO-regulated m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation after stroke, providing insights into the mechanism of circSCMH1 in promoting stroke recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Renal outcomes following intravenous contrast administration in patients with acute kidney injury: a multi-site retrospective propensity-adjusted analysis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36715705/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Evidence of an association between intravenous contrast media (CM) and persistent renal dysfunction is lacking for patients with pre-existing acute kidney injury (AKI). This study was designed to determine the association between intravenous CM administration and persistent AKI in patients with pre-existing AKI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A retrospective propensity-weighted and entropy-balanced observational cohort analysis of consecutive hospitalized patients ≥ 18 years old meeting Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine-based criteria for AKI at time of arrival to one of three emergency departments between 7/1/2017 and 6/30/2021 who did or did not receive intravenous CM. Outcomes included persistent AKI at hospital discharge and initiation of dialysis within 180 days of index encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our analysis included 14,449 patient encounters, with 12.8% admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). CM was administered in 18.4% of all encounters. AKI resolved prior to hospital discharge for 69.1%. No association between intravenous CM administration and persistent AKI was observed after unadjusted multivariable logistic regression modeling (OR 1; 95% CI 0.89-1.11), propensity weighting (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.83-1.05), and entropy balancing (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.83-1.05). Sub-group analysis in those admitted to the ICU yielded similar results. Initiation of dialysis within 180 days was observed in 5.4% of the cohort. An association between CM administration and increased risk of dialysis within 180 days was not observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Among patients with pre-existing AKI, contrast administration was not associated with either persistent AKI at hospital discharge or initiation of dialysis within 180 days. Current consensus recommendations for use of intravenous CM in patients with stable renal disease may also be applied to patients with pre-existing AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schwann cell-derived exosomes containing MFG-E8 modify macrophage/microglial polarization for attenuating inflammation via the SOCS3/STAT3 pathway after spinal cord injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophage/microglia polarization acts as an important part in regulating inflammatory responses in spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the regulation of inflammation of Schwann cell-derived exosomes (SCDEs) for SCI repair is still unclear. Therefore, we intend to find out the effect of SCDEs on regulating the inflammation related to macrophage polarization during the recovery of SCI. Firstly, the thesis demonstrated that SCDEs could attenuate the LPS- inflammation in BMDMs by suppressing M1 polarization and stimulating M2 polarization. Similarly, SCDEs improved functional recovery of female Wistar rats of the SCI contusion model according to BBB (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan) score, electrophysiological assay, and the gait analysis system of CatWalk XT. Moreover, MFG-E8 was verified as the main component of SCDEs to improve the inflammatory response by proteomic sequencing and lentiviral transfection. Improvement of the inflammatory microenvironment also inhibited neuronal apoptosis. The knockout of MFG-E8 in SCs can reverse the anti-inflammatory effects of SCDEs treatment. The SOCS3/STAT3 signaling pathway was identified to participate in upregulating M2 polarization induced by MFG-E8. In conclusion, our findings will enrich the mechanism of SCDEs in repairing SCI and provide potential applications and new insights for the clinical translation of SCDEs treatment for SCI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vimentin affects inflammation and neutrophil recruitment in airway epithelium during Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36717839/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) frequently colonizes the swine upper respiratory tract and can cause Streptococcal disease in swine with clinical manifestations of pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia. Previously, we have shown that vimentin, a kind of intermediate filament protein, is involved in the penetration of SS2 through the tracheal epithelial barrier. The initiation of invasive disease is closely related to SS2-induced excessive local inflammation; however, the role of vimentin in airway epithelial inflammation remains unclear. Here, we show that vimentin deficient mice exhibit attenuated lung injury, diminished production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and the IL-8 homolog, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), and substantially reduced neutrophils in the lungs following intranasal infection with SS2. We also found that swine tracheal epithelial cells (STEC) without vimentin show decreased transcription of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8. SS2 infection caused reassembly of vimentin in STEC, and pharmacological disruption of vimentin filaments prevented the transcription of those proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, deficiency of vimentin failed to increase the transcription of nucleotide oligomerization domain protein 2 (NOD2), which is known to interact with vimentin, and the phosphorylation of NF-κB protein p65. This study provides insights into how vimentin promotes excessive airway inflammation, thereby exacerbating airway injury and SS2-induced systemic infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Faeces-derived extracellular vesicles participate in the onset of barrier dysfunction leading to liver diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36708245/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from faeces (fEVs) and small circulating EVs (cEVs) in liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty diseases (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has not been demonstrated. fEVs and cEVs of healthy donors, NAFLD and NASH patients were isolated and characterized. The effects of EVs were evaluated in intestinal, endothelial, Kupffer and stellate cells. Non-muscular myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK) deficient mice were used in vivo. Bacterial origins of fEVs were analysed by 16s rDNA gene sequencing. fEVs and small cEVs were composed of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins. Only NASH-fEVs exerted deleterious effects. NASH-fEVs increased intestinal permeability and reduced expression of tight junction proteins that were prevented by nmMLCK inhibition, increased endothelial cell permeability and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines requiring TLR4/lipopolysaccharide pathway. NASH-fEVs and NASH-cEVs activated profibrotic and proinflammatory proteins of hepatic stellate cells. Treatment with NASH-fEVs evoked an increase in intestinal permeability in wild type but not in nmMLCK deficient mice. Bacterial origins of fEVs were different between NAFLD and NASH patients and 16 amplicon sequence variants were differentially abundant. We demonstrate that fEVs actively participate in barrier dysfunctions leading to liver injuries underscoring the role of nmMLCK and lipopolysaccharide carried by fEVs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>lncRNA CRNDE Affects Th17/IL-17A and Inhibits Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Lung Epithelial Cells Reducing Asthma Signs</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36743692/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Asthma treatment is difficult due to disease heterogeneity and comorbidities. In addition, the development of drugs targeting the underlying mechanisms of asthma remains slow. We planned to identify the most upregulated differentially expressed long noncoding RNA in asthma to explore its regulatory patterns and pathways in asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We sensitized mice using a mixture of ovalbumin, house dust mites, and lipopolysaccharide to establish an asthma mouse model. We also sensitized asthma cells with TGF-β1 in an in vitro model. We performed a microarray analysis to identify the lncRNA with the differential expression level in model mice. We applied hematoxylin and eosin and Masson&amp;rsquo;s trichrome stainings to mouse tissues to quantify the tissue damage extent. Next, we assess the levels of lncRNA CRNDE, miR-29a-3p, TGF-β1, MCL-1, E-cadherin, vimentin, and snail. We counted the percentages of Th17 cells using flow cytometry. Finally, we performed a dual-luciferase reporter assay to assess the association between lncRNA CRNDE and miR-29a-3p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We successfully established asthma mouse/cell models and selected the lncRNA CRNDE for our study. Transfection of si-CRNDE reduced the degree of injury and inflammation in the mouse model and reversed the TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the cell model. Moreover, the E-cadherin level was upregulated, and the levels of IL-17A, vimentin, snail, and α-SMA were downregulated. We also discovered that lncRNA CRNDE negatively regulated miR-29a-3p and that this one in turn inhibited MCL-1 in mice. After lncRNA CRNDE expression downregulation, the level of miR-29a-3p was increased, and we detected reduced levels of MCL-1 and EMTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; lncRNA CRNDE expression downregulation led to reduced inflammation and reduced lung damage in mice with induced asthma, it inhibited the EMTs of lung epithelial cells via the miR-29a-3p/MCL-1 pathway, and it reduced the levels of Th17/IL-17A cells to reduce asthma signs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SGLT2 Inhibitors: The Sweet Success for Kidneys</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36706745/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) were originally developed as antidiabetic agents, with cardiovascular (CV) outcome trials demonstrating improved CV outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Secondary analyses of CV outcome trials and later dedicated kidney outcome trials consistently reported improved kidney-related outcomes independent of T2D status and across a range of kidney function and albuminuria. Importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally safe and well tolerated, with clinical trials and real-world analyses demonstrating a decrease in the risk of acute kidney injury. The kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors generally extend across different members of the class, possibly on the basis of hemodynamic, metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes in diverse patient populations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pathological consequences of DNA damage in the kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36702905/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA lesions that evade repair can lead to mutations that drive the development of cancer, and cellular responses to DNA damage can trigger senescence and cell death, which are associated with ageing. In the kidney, DNA damage has been implicated in both acute and chronic kidney injury, and in renal cell carcinoma. The susceptibility of the kidney to chemotherapeutic agents that damage DNA is well established, but an unexpected link between kidney ciliopathies and the DNA damage response has also been reported. In addition, human genetic deficiencies in DNA repair have highlighted DNA crosslinks, DNA breaks and transcription-blocking damage as lesions that are particularly toxic to the kidney. Genetic tools in mice, as well as advances in kidney organoid and single-cell RNA sequencing technologies, have provided important insights into how specific kidney cell types respond to DNA damage. The emerging view is that in the kidney, DNA damage affects the local microenvironment by triggering a damage response and cell proliferation to replenish injured cells, as well as inducing systemic responses aimed at reducing exposure to genotoxic stress. The pathological consequences of DNA damage are therefore key to the nephrotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and the kidney phenotypes observed in human DNA repair-deficiency disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kirenol inhibits inflammation challenged by lipopolysaccharide through the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 autophagy pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36706589/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirenol is a bioactive substance isolated from &lt;em&gt;Herba Siegesbeckiae&lt;/em&gt;. Although the anti-inflammatory activity of kirenol has been well documented, its role in autophagy remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the protective role of kirenol on inflammation challenged by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in acute lung injury (ALI) cell and mouse models and unravel the underlying mechanisms, with a particular focus on autophagy. For this purpose, an ALI cell and mouse models were established, and the effects of kirenol on the expression of molecules related to inflammation and autophagy were examined. The present results revealed that kirenol could significantly inhibit inflammatory cytokines secretion in cells and in the mice injured by LPS; this effect may be attributed to enhanced autophagy as evidenced by the up-regulation of LC3-II and the down-regulation of p62 both in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylated AMPK and ULK1 increased, while phosphorylated mTOR decreased in the kirenol-treated ALI cell model. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy using AMPK inhibitor or 3-MA or chloroquine (CQ) reversed the anti-inflammatory and autophagy-enhancement effects of kirenol exposure in vitro, indicating that kirenol could enhance autophagy by activating the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 pathway. The results of RNA sequencing suggested that kirenol was strongly related to the biological functions of acute inflammatory response and the AMPK signaling pathway. Further in vivo ALI mouse model studies demonstrated the protective role of kirenol against lung inflammation, such as improved histopathology, decreased lung edema, and leukocyte infiltration were abolished by 3-MA. These findings implicate that kirenol can inhibit LPS-induced inflammation via the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 autophagy pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Skullcapflavone II, a novel NQO1 inhibitor, alleviates aristolochic acid I-induced liver and kidney injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36697978/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristolochic acid I (AAI) is a well established nephrotoxin and human carcinogen. Cytosolic NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) plays an important role in the nitro reduction of aristolochic acids, leading to production of aristoloactam and AA-DNA adduct. Application of a potent NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol is limited by its life-threatening side effect as an anticoagulant and the subsequent hemorrhagic complications. As traditional medicines containing AAI remain available in the market, novel NQO1 inhibitors are urgently needed to attenuate the toxicity of AAI exposure. In this study, we employed comprehensive 2D NQO1 biochromatography to screen candidate compounds that could bind with NQO1 protein. Four compounds, i.e., skullcapflavone II (SFII), oroxylin A, wogonin and tectochrysin were screened out from Scutellaria baicalensis. Among them, SFII was the most promising NQO1 inhibitor with a binding affinity (KD = 4.198 μmol/L) and inhibitory activity (IC50 = 2.87 μmol/L). In human normal liver cell line (L02) and human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2), SFII significantly alleviated AAI-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. In adult mice, oral administration of SFII dose-dependently ameliorated AAI-induced renal fibrosis and dysfunction. In infant mice, oral administration of SFII suppressed AAI-induced hepatocellular carcinoma initiation. Moreover, administration of SFII did not affect the coagulation function in short term in adult mice. In conclusion, SFII has been identified as a novel NQO1 inhibitor that might impede the risk of AAI to kidney and liver without obvious side effect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting interleukin-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin pathways for novel pulmonary therapeutics in asthma and COPD</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36697211/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interleukin-33 (IL-33) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are alarmins that are released upon airway epithelial injury from insults such as viruses and cigarette smoke, and play critical roles in the activation of immune cell populations such as mast cells, eosinophils and group 2 innate lymphoid cells. Both cytokines were previously understood to primarily drive type 2 (T2) inflammation, but there is emerging evidence for a role for these alarmins to additionally mediate non-T2 inflammation, with recent clinical trial data in asthma and COPD cohorts with non-T2 inflammation providing support. Currently available treatments for both COPD and asthma provide symptomatic relief with disease control, improving lung function and reducing exacerbation rates; however, there still remains an unmet need for further improving lung function and reducing exacerbations, particularly for those not responsive to currently available treatments. The epithelial cytokines/alarmins are involved in exacerbations; biologics targeting TSLP and IL-33 have been shown to reduce exacerbations in moderate-to-severe asthma, either in a broad population or in specific subgroups, respectively. For COPD, while there is clinical evidence for IL-33 blockade impacting exacerbations in COPD, clinical data from anti-TSLP therapies is awaited. Clinical data to date support an acceptable safety profile for patients with airway diseases for both anti-IL-33 and anti-TSLP antibodies in development. We examine the roles of IL-33 and TSLP, their potential use as drug targets, and the evidence for target patient populations for COPD and asthma, together with ongoing and future trials focused on these targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The temporal characteristics of the disruption of gut microbiota, serum metabolome, and cytokines by silica exposure in wistar rats</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silica exposure causes impaired lung function and lung tissue damage in wistar rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At different stages, the changes of intestinal microflora in rats were different after silica exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serum metabolites and disrupted multiple metabolic pathways differed after varied silica exposure exposure duration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The inflammation-metabolite-gut microbiota interaction axis varies at different stages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicosis is one of the most frequent, rapidly developing, and lethal types of pneumoconiosis. However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of its pathogenesis and progress remains unclear. We investigated the fundamental processes of silicosis incidence and progression using a combination of lung function testing, histopathology, 16 S rRNA, untargeted metabolomics, and cytokine chips at different exposure times (4 or 8 weeks). The results show that silica exposure damages lung tissue reduces lung function, and increases with time. Cytokines with time-specific properties were found in lung lavage fluid: IFN-γ (4 weeks; _P_＜0.05), TNF-α, M-CSF, GM-CSF (8 weeks; _P_＜0.01). In addition, silica exposure for different periods interferes to varying degrees with the metabolism of lipids. The composition of the intestinal microbiota changed with increasing exposure time and there were time-specific: &lt;em&gt;Allobaculum&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/em&gt;、 &lt;em&gt;Jeotgalicoccu&lt;/em&gt;、 &lt;em&gt;Coprococcus 1&lt;/em&gt; (4 weeks; _P_＜0.05), &lt;em&gt;Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group&lt;/em&gt;、 &lt;em&gt;Ruminiclostridium 5&lt;/em&gt; (8 weeks; _P_＜0.05). We found strong associations between cytokines, gut microbiota changes, and metabolic disturbances at different exposure times. These results suggest that time-specific changes in crosstalk among cytokines, the gut microbiota, and metabolites may be a potential mechanism for silica-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PQ poisoning can induce acute lung injury and fibrosis without effective treatment methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TwHF possessed potential properties in therapies for PQ-induced lung injury and fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protective effect of TwHF may be due to the regulation of oxidative stress and ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paraquat (PQ) poisoning can induce acute lung injury and fibrosis and has an extremely high mortality rate. However, no effective treatments for PQ poisoning have been established. In this study, the potential efficacy of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f. (TwHF) in alleviating PQ-induced lung injury and fibrosis was investigated in a mouse model. Mice were randomly assigned to the control, PQ, PQ + TwHF1 (pretreatment before inducing poisoning), and PQ + TwHF2 (treatment after poisoning) groups. The mice in the PQ + TwHF1 group were pretreated with TwHF for 5 days before receiving one dose of PQ (120 mg/kg) and then received a daily oral gavage of the indicated dosages of TwHF until sacrifice. The mice in the PQ + TwHF2 group were treated with TwHF 2 h after PQ exposure until sacrifice. The pathological analysis and Fapi PET/CT showed that treatment with TwHF attenuated lung injury. And TwHF reduced pulmonary oxidative stress, as indicated by the reduction in, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, as well as by the increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Accordingly, the Perls DAB staining showed increased iron concentrations and western blotting revealed a decreased GPX4 expression after PQ exposure, as well as the mitigation of the overexpression of Nrf2 and HO-1 induced by PQ. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the potential of TwHF as a treatment for PQ-induced lung injury and fibrosis. The protective mechanism of this medicinal herb may involve the regulation of ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;hUC-MSCs reduced lung injury and inflammation in mice with LPS-induced ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic YAP regulation on AECII was mediated by hUC-MSCs in LPS-induced ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inactivation of YAP facilitated LPS-induced AECII differentiation in response to hUC-MSCs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hUC-MSCs may have potential in the treatment of ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) contributes to higher mortality worldwide. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) have immunomodulatory and regenerative potential. However, the effects of hUC-MSCs as an ARDS treatment remain unclear. We investigated the role of hUC-MSCs in the differentiation of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) by regulating Yes-associated protein (YAP) in ARDS. Male C57BL/6JNarl mice were intratracheally (i.t.) administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an ARDS model, followed by a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of hUC-MSCs. hUC-MSCs improved pulmonary function, decreased inflammation on day 3, and mitigated lung injury by reducing the lung injury score and increasing lung aeration (%) in mice on day 7 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). hUC-MSCs inactivated YAP on AECII and facilitated cell differentiation by decreasing Pro-surfactant protein C (Pro-SPC) and galectin 3 (LGALS3) while increasing podoplanin (T1α) in lungs of mice (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In AECII MLE-12 cells, both coculture with hUC-MSCs after LPS exposure and the YAP inhibitor, verteporfin, reduced Pro-SPC and LGALS3, whereas the YAP inhibitor increased T1α expression (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In conclusion, hUC-MSCs ameliorated lung injury of ARDS and regulated YAP to facilitate AECII differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in lung epithelial cells triggers radiation-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36694200/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is the most common and serious complication of chest radiotherapy. However, reported radioprotective agents usually lead to radiation resistance in tumor cells. The key to solving this problem is to distinguish between the response of tumor cells and normal lung epithelial cells to radiation damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; RNA-Seq was used to recognize potential target of alleviating the progression of RILI as well as inhibiting tumor growth. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in lung epithelial cells was screened by qRT-PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence, and ELISA. An in vivo model of RILI and in vitro conditioned culture model were constructed to evaluate the effect of NLRP3/interleukin-1β on fibroblasts activation. ROS, ATP, and (NADP)+/NADP(H) level in lung epithelial cells was detected to explore the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The lung macrophages of the mice were deleted to evaluate the role of lung epithelial cells in RILI. Moreover, primary cells were extracted to validate the results obtained from cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; NLRP3 activation in epithelial cells after radiation depends on glycolysis-related reactive oxygen species accumulation. DPYSL4 is activated and acts as a negative regulator of this process. The NLRP3 inflammasome triggers interleukin-1β secretion, which directly affects fibroblast activation, proliferation, and migration, eventually leading to lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study suggests that NLRP3 inflammasome activation in lung epithelial cells is essential for radiation-induced lung injury. These data strongly indicate that targeting NLRP3 may be effective in reducing radiation-induced lung injury in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long-term statins administration exacerbates diabetic nephropathy via ectopic fat deposition in diabetic mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36693830/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statins play an important role in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Increasing attention has been given to the relationship between statins and insulin resistance, but many randomized controlled trials confirm that the therapeutic effects of statins on diabetic nephropathy are more beneficial than harmful. However, further confirmation of whether the beneficial effects of chronic statin administration on diabetic nephropathy outweigh the detrimental effects is urgently needed. Here, we find that long-term statin administration may increase insulin resistance, interfere with lipid metabolism, leads to inflammation and fibrosis, and ultimately fuel diabetic nephropathy progression in diabetic mice. Mechanistically, activation of insulin-regulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway leads to increased fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, statins administration increases lipid uptake and inhibits fatty acid oxidation, leading to lipid deposition. Here we show that long-term statins administration exacerbates diabetic nephropathy via ectopic fat deposition in diabetic mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Menthol Flavoring in E-Cigarette Condensate Causes Pulmonary Dysfunction and Cytotoxicity in Precision Cut Lung Slices</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-cigarette consumption is under scrutiny by regulatory authorities due to concerns about product toxicity, lack of manufacturing standards, and increasing reports of e-cigarette- or vaping-associated acute lung injury. In vitro studies have demonstrated cytotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress induced by unflavored e-cigarette aerosols and flavoring additives. However, e-cigarette effects on the complex lung parenchyma remain unclear. Herein, the impact of e-cigarette condensates with or without menthol flavoring on functional, structural, and cellular responses was investigated using mouse precision cut lung slices (PCLS). PCLS were exposed to e-cigarette condensates prepared from aerosolized vehicle, nicotine, nicotine + menthol, and menthol e-fluids at doses from 50-500 mM. Doses were normalized to the glycerin content of vehicle. Video-microscopy of PCLS revealed impaired contractile responsiveness of airways to methacholine and dampened ciliary beating following exposure to menthol-containing condensates at concentrations greater than 300 mM. Following 500 mM menthol-containing condensate exposure, epithelial exfoliation in intrabronchial airways was identified in histological sections of PCLS. Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release, mitochondrial WST-1 conversion, and glutathione content supported earlier findings of nicotine or nicotine + menthol e-cigarette-induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity and oxidative stress responses. Evaluation of PCLS metabolic activity revealed dose-related impairment of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis after exposure to menthol-containing condensates. Taken together, these data demonstrate prominent menthol-induced pulmonary toxicity and impairment of essential physiological functions in the lung, which warrants concerns about e-cigarette consumer safety and emphasizes the need for further investigations of molecular mechanisms of toxicity and menthol effects in an experimental model of disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RAGE inhibition alleviates lipopolysaccharides-induced lung injury via directly suppressing autophagic apoptosis of type II alveolar epithelial cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36691012/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Advanced glycation end product receptor (RAGE) acts as a receptor of pro-inflammatory ligands and is highly expressed in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Autophagy in AECs has received much attention recently. However, the roles of autophagy and RAGE in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore whether RAGE activation signals take part in the dysfunction of alveolar epithelial barrier through autophagic death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury animal models were established using C57BL/6 and Ager gene knockout (Ager -/- mice) mice in this study. A549 cells and primary type II alveolar epithelial (ATII) cells were treated with siRNA to reduce Ager gene expression. Autophagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Lung injury was assessed by histopathological examination. Cell viability was estimated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and soluble RAGE (sRAGE) were evaluated by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The involvement of RAGE signals, autophagy and apoptosis was assessed using western blots, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy and TUNEL test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The expression of RAGE was promoted by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which was associated with activation of autophagy both in mice lung tissues and A549 cells as well as primary ATII cells. sRAGE in BALF was positively correlated with IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Compared with the wild-type mice, inflammation and apoptosis in lung tissues were alleviated in Ager-/- mice. Persistently activated autophagy contributed to cell apoptosis, whereas the inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA protected lungs from damage. In addition, Ager knockdown inhibited LPS-induced autophagy activation and attenuated lung injury. In vitro, knockdown of RAGE significantly suppressed the activation of LPS-induced autophagy and apoptosis of A549 and primary ATII cells. Furthermore, RAGE activated the downstream STAT3 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; RAGE plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of ATII cells injury. Our results suggested that RAGE inhibition alleviated LPS-induced lung injury by directly suppressing autophagic apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Zfp521 promotes chondrocytes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zfp521 maintains chondrocytes extracellular matrix homeostasis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zfp521 attenuates osteoarthritis via HDAC4 in the cell nucleus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether zinc finger protein 521 (Zfp521) has a chondroprotective effect by maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis to attenuate osteoarthritis (OA). In chondrocytes, Zfp521 was overexpressed or silenced to detect its effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and ECM homeostasis. Adenovirus encoding Zfp521 was injected into the knee joints of anterior cruciate ligament transection rats to test its efficacy against OA. Combined with proteomic analysis, the molecular mechanism of Zfp521 in cartilage degeneration was further explored. An intra-articular injection of adenovirus carrying a Zfp521 sequence showed a chondroprotective effect against OA. The molecular mechanism around Zfp521 was classified at the molecular, cellular, histological, and functional levels. It was reported that Zfp521 could effectively promote cartilage proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and maintain the balance of anabolism and catabolism of ECM. Moreover, it was confirmed that Zfp521 exerted its effect better by upregulating histone deacetylases 4 (HDAC4) in the nucleus and was significantly weakened in the absence of HDAC4 in the nucleus. Overall, Zfp521 better exerts its efficacy against OA by increasing the HDAC4 content in the nucleus, making it a promising strategy for OA treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and sepsis, characterized by systemic inflammatory response syndrome, remain the major causes of death in severe patients. Inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines is considered to be a promising method for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases. In this study, a total of 28 4-oxo-N-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide derivatives were designed and synthesized and their anti-inflammatory activities in J774A.1 were evaluated. Among them, derivative 13a was found to significantly inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on J774A.1, THP-1 and LX-2 cells, and inhibited the activation of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, administration of 13ain vivo significantly improved the symptoms in LPS-induced ALI mice, including alleviation of pathological changes in the lung tissue, reduction of pulmonary edema, and inhibition of macrophage infiltration. Moreover, the administration of 13ain vivo significantly promoted survival in LPS-induced sepsis mice. 13a demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic properties with T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; value of 11.8 h and F value of 36.3%. Therefore, this study has identified a novel 4-oxo-N-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide derivative, 13a, which is an effective anti-inflammatory agent. The findings have laid a foundation for the further development of agents to treat ALI and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The amounts of dopamine are negatively correlated with circulating ILC2 numbers in humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dopamine suppresses ILC2-driven allergic airway inflammation via DRD1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dopamine constrains ILC2 responses through inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local administration of dopamine may represent a promising therapeutic regimen for asthma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal signals have emerged as pivotal regulators of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that regulate tissue homeostasis and allergic inflammation. The molecular pathways underlying the neuronal regulation of ILC2 responses in lungs remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that the abundance of neurotransmitter dopamine was negatively correlated with circulating ILC2 numbers and positively associated with pulmonary function in humans. Dopamine potently suppressed lung ILC2 responses in a DRD1-receptor-dependent manner. Genetic deletion of &lt;em&gt;Drd1&lt;/em&gt; or local ablation of dopaminergic neurons augmented ILC2 responses and allergic lung inflammation. Transcriptome and metabolic analyses revealed that dopamine impaired the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway in ILC2s. Augmentation of OXPHOS activity with oltipraz antagonized the inhibitory effect of dopamine. Local administration of dopamine alleviated allergen-induced ILC2 responses and airway inflammation. These findings demonstrate that dopamine represents an inhibitory regulator of ILC2 responses in allergic airway inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2, primarily authenticated in November 2021 in South Africa, has initiated the 5th wave of global pandemics. Here, we systemically examined immunological and metabolic characteristics of Omicron variants infection. We found Omicron resisted to neutralizing antibody targeting receptor binding domain (RBD) of wildtype SARS-CoV-2. Omicron could hardly be neutralized by sera of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescents infected with the Delta variant. Through mass spectrometry on MHC-bound peptidomes, we found that the spike protein of the Omicron variants could generate additional CD8 + T cell epitopes, compared with Delta. These epitopes could induce robust CD8 + T cell responses. Moreover, we found booster vaccination increased the cross-memory CD8 + T cell responses against Omicron. Metabolic regulome analysis of Omicron-specific T cell showed a metabolic profile that promoted the response of memory T cells. Consistently, a greater fraction of memory CD8 + T cells existed in Omicron stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, CD147 was also a receptor for the Omicron variants, and CD147 antibody inhibited infection of Omicron. CD147-mediated Omicron infection in a human CD147 transgenic mouse model induced exudative alveolar pneumonia. Taken together, our data suggested that vaccination booster and receptor blocking antibody are two effective strategies against Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requires proteolytic cleavage of the viral spike protein. While the role of the host transmembrane protease serine 2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection is widely recognized, the involvement of other proteases capable of facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry remains incompletely explored. Here, we show that multiple members from the membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase (MT-MMP) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase families can mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Inhibition of MT-MMPs significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that MT-MMPs can cleave SARS-CoV-2 spike and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and facilitate spike-mediated fusion. We further demonstrate that Omicron BA.1 has an increased efficiency on MT-MMP usage, while an altered efficiency on transmembrane serine protease usage for virus entry compared with that of ancestral SARS-CoV-2. These results reveal additional protease determinants for SARS-CoV-2 infection and enhance our understanding on the biology of coronavirus entry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibronectin (FN) is an essential glycoprotein in the extracellular matrix with favorable biological functions for potential applications in various biomedical fields including wound healing, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, as well as diagnosis and treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. Herein, we aim to explore the influence of intracellular FN delivery on macrophage functions and its possible therapeutic applications. We prepared phenylboronic acid (PBA)-functionalized generation 5 (G5) poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (G5.NH2-PBA) as a nanocarrier to load FN, and reveal that the obtained dendrimers enable efficient intracellular delivery of FN at an optimized dendrimer-to-FN weight ratio of 8, which guides macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype polarization. Studies on action mechanisms show that the dendrimer-mediated FN intracellular delivery acts strongly on suppressing the nuclear factor-κB pathway, leading to reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and enhanced reactive oxygen species depletion in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. Further investigation in vivo using an LPS-induced mouse model of acute lung injury (ALI) shows that the dendrimer-mediated FN delivery can effectively alleviate the ALI symptoms through alleviation of lung inflammation and oxidation stress. Our work suggests a general approach to using dendrimers for mediating intracellular delivery of FN, thereby offering many opportunities to explore the biological functions of FN for different therapeutic applications toward inflammation-associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery and pharmacological characterization of a novel benzimidazole TRPV4 antagonist with cyanocyclobutyl moiety</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36696767/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2b displayed more potent &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; TRPV4 inhibition activity than GSK-Bz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single cell patch-clamp proved that 2b also gave significantly improved potency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2b is a novel and highly potent TRPV4 antagonist &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSK-Bz, a TPRV4 antagonist discovered by GSK, displayed potent in vitro TRPV4 inhibition activity, and demonstrated ability to inhibit TRPV4-mediated pulmonary edema in an &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; rat model. In this study, a series of GSK-Bz derivatives were designed and synthesized based on our previous findings. Compound 2b with cyanocyclobutyl moiety (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 22.65 nM) was found to be 5.3-fold more potent than GSK-Bz (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 121.6 nM) in the calcium imaging experiment. Patch-clamp experiments confirmed that compound 2b (IR = 77.1%) also gave significantly improved potency on TRPV4 currents measured at -60 mV. Furthermore, 2b effectively suppressed the permeability response to LPS in HUVEC with negligible cytotoxicity (CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 100 μM). The &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; protective effects of compounds 2b on acute lung injury were finally assessed in an LPS-induced ALI mice model. Notably, 2b gave better results than HC-067047 against all of the tested indexes (lung W/D ratios, the concentrations of BALF protein and pathological scores), indicating that 2b is a novel and highly potent TRPV4 antagonist which is worth for further development. Currently, evaluation for the drug-like properties of 2b is underway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery of alantolactone as a natural NLRP3 inhibitor to alleviate NLRP3-driven inflammatory diseases in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36668704/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and purpose:&lt;/em&gt; NLRP3 inflammasome activation is involved in many inflammatory diseases, however, no small-molecule inhibitors of NLRP3 have been clinically used so far. Discovery of natural NLRP3 inhibitors may be beneficial to the design and development of molecules targeting NLRP3. Alantolactone (ALA) is a natural compound isolated from a traditional Chinese medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory activity, but the precise target of ALA remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental approach:&lt;/em&gt; The inhibitory activity of 150 natural compounds against NLRP3-driven IL-1β production was screened in macrophages. Mice models of gouty arthritis and acute lung injury were used to determine the efficacy of the potential compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key results:&lt;/em&gt; Among 150 compounds in an in-house natural products bank, ALA was found to possess the highest inhibitory activity against LPS + ATP-induced IL-1β production in macrophages. We demonstrated that ALA suppressed the IL-1β secretion, the caspase-1 activation, and pyroptosis in LPS + ATP-challenged macrophages. Further studies showed that ALA directly bound to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 to inhibit the activation and assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome. The molecular simulation showed that Arg335 in NLRP3 might be a critical residue for ALA binding, leading to suppression of NLRP3-NEK7 interaction. The &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; studies validated that ALA significantly alleviated NLRP3-driven inflammatory diseases, including acute lung injury and gouty arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion and implications:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, we identified ALA as a natural inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome by directly targeting NLRP3 NACHT domain. ALA shows great potential in the treatment of NLRP3-driven diseases and the development of novel NLRP3 inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomes as perioperative therapeutics to limit organ injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perioperative organ injury is a frequent and major complication for the ∼240 million people undergoing surgery worldwide annually. Ischaemic preconditioning is a powerful technique that reduces organ injury in experimental models of heart, lung, gut, brain, and kidney ischaemia-reperfusion injury. However, ischaemic preconditioning has been a challenge to translate into clinical practice. We describe how utilising isolated pre-conditioned exosomes (secreted vesicles containing many cell-survival mediators), some of the translational hurdles of ischaemic preconditioning can be overcome. Delivery of exosomes in the perioperative period could become a promising new therapeutic strategy to prevent perioperative organ injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Circadian Biology of Heart Failure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driven by autonomous molecular clocks that are synchronized by a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, cardiac physiology fluctuates in diurnal rhythms that can be partly or entirely circadian. Cardiac contractility, metabolism, and electrophysiology, all have diurnal rhythms, as does the neurohumoral control of cardiac and kidney function. In this review, we discuss the evidence that circadian biology regulates cardiac function, how molecular clocks may relate to the pathogenesis of heart failure, and how chronotherapeutics might be applied in heart failure. Disrupting molecular clocks can lead to heart failure in animal models, and the myocardial response to injury seems to be conditioned by the time of day. Human studies are consistent with these findings, and they implicate the clock and circadian rhythms in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Certain circadian rhythms are maintained in patients with heart failure, a factor that can guide optimal timing of therapy. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic manipulation of circadian rhythms and molecular clocks show promise in the prevention and treatment of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amomum subulatum mitigates experimental thoracic radiation-induced lung injury by regulating antioxidant status and inflammatory responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36655677/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is one of the most prominent complications of thoracic radiotherapy for which effective therapy is still lacking. This study investigates the nutraceutical potential of the culinary spice &lt;em&gt;Amomum subulatum&lt;/em&gt; in mitigating thoracic radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Mouse models of RP and PF were established by whole thorax irradiation at a dose of 25 gray. C57BL/6 mice were administered with 250 mg per kg body weight of methanolic extract of &lt;em&gt;A. subulatum&lt;/em&gt; dry fruits (MEAS) for four consecutive weeks and observed for changes in lung tissue antioxidant activities, oxidative stress parameters, and expression of antioxidant, inflammation, and fibrosis-related genes by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR analysis, and histology analysis. MEAS administration reduced radiation-induced oxidative stress by enhancing the expression of Nrf2 and its target genes. Irradiation increased gene expression of inflammatory mediators and lung histology further confirmed the characteristics of RP, which were reduced by MEAS treatment. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed the potential of MEAS in reducing the radiation-induced elevation of cyclooxygenase 2 expression in the lungs. The late sequel of RILI was manifested as PF, characterized by the elevated expression of pro-fibrotic genes and increased collagen content. However, MEAS administration markedly reduced radiation-induced fibrotic changes in the lungs. These effects might be attributed to the synergistic effect of bioactive polyphenols in MEAS with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic efficacies. Taken together, this study demonstrates the potential of MEAS in mitigating RILI, suggesting the possible nutraceutical application of &lt;em&gt;A. subulatum&lt;/em&gt; against radiation toxicities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C-type lectin Mincle initiates IL-17-mediated inflammation in acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36680813/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) has a poor prognosis and high mortality. However, there is limited information regarding the mechanisms of AE-IPF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; We aimed to explore the function of macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) in AE-IPF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In the present study, Mincle was detected in the lung tissues of AE-IPF patients. Mincle-deficient (&lt;em&gt;Mincle&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were administered bleomycin (BLM), followed by HSV1 viral infection to establish the AE-IPF model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Mincle was increased in the lung tissues of AE-IPF patients compared with those with stable IPF (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04) and healthy controls (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009). The survival rate of the &lt;em&gt;Mincle&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;+BLM+HSV group was higher than that of the WT+BLM+HSV group. The mice in the &lt;em&gt;Mincle&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;+BLM+HSV group exhibited milder inflammation and lower acute lung injury scores (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.008). Mincle was expressed on inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils (CD11b+Gr1 +F4/80-) and monocyte-derived macrophages (Mo-AMs, CD11b+Gr1 +F4/80 +) in the BALF of AE-IPF mice. Mo-AMs were significantly increased in the WT+BLM+HSV group compared with the WT+BLM+PBS (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and Mincle-/-+BLM+HSV (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0009) groups. Deletion of Mincle decreased the proportion of Th17 cells and Mo-AMs in the &lt;em&gt;Mincle&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;+BLM+HSV group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Mincle contributed to acute inflammation in AE-IPF by promoting Th17 differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Formyl peptide receptor 2 activation by mitochondrial formyl peptides stimulates the neutrophil proinflammatory response via the ERK pathway and exacerbates ischemia-reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36658472/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an inevitable process in renal transplantation that significantly increases the risk of delayed graft function, acute rejection, and even graft loss. Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) is an important receptor in multiple septic and aseptic injuries, but its functions in kidney IRI are still unclear. This study was designed to reveal the pathological role of FPR2 in kidney IRI and its functional mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To explore the mechanism of FPR2 in kidney IRI, the model rats were sacrificed after IRI surgery. Immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and western blotting were used to detect differences in the expression of FPR2 and its ligands between the IRI and control groups. WRW4 (WRWWWW-NH2), a specific antagonist of FPR2, was administered to kidney IRI rats. Kidney function and pathological damage were detected to assess kidney injury and recovery. Flow cytometry was used to quantitatively compare neutrophil infiltration among the experimental groups. Mitochondrial formyl peptides (mtFPs) were synthesized and administered to primary rat neutrophils together with the specific FPR family antagonist WRW4 to verify our hypothesis in vitro. Western blotting and cell function assays were used to examine the functions and signaling pathways that FPR2 mediates in neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; FPR2 was activated mainly by mtFPs during the acute phase of IRI, mediating neutrophil migration and reactive oxygen species production in the rat kidney through the ERK1/2 pathway. FPR2 blockade in the early phase protected rat kidneys from IRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; mtFPs activated FPR2 during the acute phase of IRI and mediated rat kidney injury by activating the migration and reactive oxygen species generation of neutrophils through the ERK1/2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kaempferide ameliorates cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity via inhibiting oxidative stress and inducing autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36658427/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by anti-tumor drugs, such as cisplatin, is a severe complication with no effective treatment currently, leading to the reduction or discontinuation of chemotherapy. Natural products or herbal medicines are gradually considered as promising agents against cisplatin-induced AKI with the advantages of multi-targeting, multi-effects, and less resistance. In this study, we investigated the effects of kaempferide, a natural flavonoid extracted from the rhizome of Kaempferia galanga, in experimental AKI models in vitro and in vivo. We first conducted pharmacokinetic study in mice and found a relative stable state of kaempferide with a small amount of conversion into kaempferol. We showed that both kaempferide (10 μM) and kaempferol (10 μM) significantly inhibited cisplatin-caused injuries in immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2. In AKI mice induced by injection of a single dose of cisplatin (15 mg/kg), oral administration of kaempferide (50 mg/kg) either before or after cisplatin injection markedly improved renal function, and ameliorated renal tissue damage. We demonstrated that kaempferide inhibited oxidative stress and induced autophagy in cisplatin-treated mice and HK-2 cells, thus increasing tubular cell viability and decreasing immune responses to attenuate the disease progression. In addition, treatment with kaempferide significantly ameliorated ischemia-reperfusion-induced renal injury in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that kaempferide is a promising natural product for treating various AKI. This study has great implications for promotion of its use in healthcare products, and help to break through the limited use of cisplatin in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light-sheet imaging of intact bones uncovers lymphatic vessels in bones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stress-induced IL6 drives lymphatic vessel expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lymphatic vessels mediate bone and hematopoietic regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lymphangiocrine CXCL12 supports regeneration in bone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood and lymphatic vessels form a versatile transport network and provide inductive signals to regulate tissue-specific functions. Blood vessels in bone regulate osteogenesis and hematopoiesis, but current dogma suggests that bone lacks lymphatic vessels. Here, by combining high-resolution light-sheet imaging and cell-specific mouse genetics, we demonstrate presence of lymphatic vessels in mouse and human bones. We find that lymphatic vessels in bone expand during genotoxic stress. VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling and genotoxic stress-induced IL6 drive lymphangiogenesis in bones. During lymphangiogenesis, secretion of CXCL12 from proliferating lymphatic endothelial cells is critical for hematopoietic and bone regeneration. Moreover, lymphangiocrine CXCL12 triggers expansion of mature Myh11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CXCR4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pericytes, which differentiate into bone cells and contribute to bone and hematopoietic regeneration. In aged animals, such expansion of lymphatic vessels and Myh11-positive cells in response to genotoxic stress is impaired. These data suggest lymphangiogenesis as a therapeutic avenue to stimulate hematopoietic and bone regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>8-Oxoguanine targeted by 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is central to fibrogenic gene activation upon lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in epithelial cell-state transition and deposition of extracellular matrix upon airway injury. Of the many cellular targets of ROS, oxidative DNA modification is a major driving signal. However, the role of oxidative DNA damage in modulation profibrotic processes has not been fully delineated. Herein, we report that oxidative DNA base lesions, 8-oxoG, complexed with 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) functions as a pioneer factor, contributing to transcriptional reprogramming within airway epithelial cells. We show that TGFβ1-induced ROS increased 8-oxoG levels in open chromatin, dynamically reconfigure the chromatin state. OGG1 complexed with 8-oxoG recruits transcription factors, including phosphorylated SMAD3, to pro-fibrotic gene promoters thereby facilitating gene activation. Moreover, 8-oxoG levels are elevated in lungs of mice subjected to TGFβ1-induced injury. Pharmacologic targeting of OGG1 with the selective small molecule inhibitor of 8-oxoG binding, TH5487, abrogates fibrotic gene expression and remodeling in this model. Collectively, our study implicates that 8-oxoG substrate-specific binding by OGG1 is a central modulator of transcriptional regulation in response to tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scavenger receptor BI attenuates oxidized phospholipid-induced pulmonary inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36681128/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These studies demonstrate that scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) limits the lung pathology and inflammation following the generation of the danger associated molecular pattern oxidized phospholipids (oxPL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These findings indicate that if SR-BI is dysfunctional, there is a lack of oxPL clearance, dysfunctional lipid metabolism, and increased toll-like receptor 4 signaling in the lung leading to increased lung pathologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules released from dead/dying cells following toxicant and/or environmental exposures that activate the immune response through binding pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Excessive production of DAMPs or failed clearance leads to chronic inflammation and delayed inflammation resolution. One category of DAMPs are oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs) produced upon exposure to high levels of oxidative stress, such as following ozone (O3)- induced inflammation. OxPLs are bound by multiple classes of PRRs that include scavenger receptors (SRs) such as SR class B-1 (SR-BI) and toll-like receptors (TLRs). Interactions between oxPLs and PRRs appear to regulate inflammation; however, the role of SR-BI in oxPL-induced lung inflammation has not been defined. Therefore, we hypothesize that SR-BI is critical in protecting the lung from oxPL-induced pulmonary inflammation/injury. To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6 J (WT) female mice were dosed with oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (oxPAPC) by oropharyngeal aspiration and identified increased pulmonary SR-BI expression. Following oxPAPC exposure, SR-BI deficient (SR-BI&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) mice exhibited increased lung pathology and inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production. Lipidomic analysis revealed that SR-BI&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had an altered pulmonary lipidome prior to and following oxPAPC exposure, which correlated with increased oxidized phosphatidylcholines (PCs). Finally, we characterized TLR4-mediated activation of NF-κB following oxPAPC exposure and discovered that SR-BI&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased TLR4 mRNA expression in lung tissue and macrophages, increased nuclear p65, and decreased cytoplasmic IκBα. Overall, we conclude that SR-BI is required for limiting oxPAPC-induced lung pathology by maintaining lipid homeostasis, reducing oxidized PCs, and attenuating TLR4-NF-κB activation thereby preventing excessive and persistent inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The antimicrobial peptide LK2(6)A(L) exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by binding to the myeloid differentiation 2 domain and protects against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36706531/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LK2(6)A(L) reflected anti-inflammatory activity through TLR4 signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LK2(6)A(L) interacted with MD2 and the knockdown MD2 abolished its anti-inflammatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key domain of LK2(6)A(L) binding to MD2 was its amino acid domain 7–13 (IS-7).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LK2(6)A(L) and IS-7 displayed protective effects in LPS-induced ALI mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease that is generally attributable to an uncontrolled inflammatory response in the lung, but there is a lack of effective treatments. At present, regulating the inflammatory response has become an important strategy for treating ALI. In the present study, LK2(6)A(L), a peptide derived from the natural antimicrobial peptide temporin-1CEa, inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and NO in RAW264.7 cells. Herein, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of LK2(6)A(L) was investigated. The RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) results showed that LK2(6)A(L) significantly inhibited the TLR4-mediated NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. The results of co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), pull-down experiment, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) suggested that MD2 was the direct target of LK2(6)A(L). Chemical inhibition of MD2 and its knockdown abolished the anti-inflammatory effect of LK2(6)A(L). Molecular dynamic simulation indicated that LK2(6)A(L) could bind to the active domain of the MD2 hydrophobic pocket via six hydrogen bonds. The truncated peptides were designed based on analysis of the molecular docking of LK2(6)A(L) to MD2. The truncated peptide IS-7 showed strong affinity to MD2 and a remarkable inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory factors that was comparable to the effect of LK2(6)A(L). Finally, LK2(6)A(L) and IS-7 relieved inflammatory symptoms and lung tissue destruction in the ALI mouse model. Overall, our study suggested that LK2(6)A(L) showed promising anti-inflammatory activity by targeting MD2, and the amino acid domain 7-13 was an important area that binds with MD2 and also an anti-inflammatory active region. LK2(6)A(L) and IS-7 may be potential new treatments for ALI and other acute inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective Effect of Calpain Inhibition During Cold Ischemia on Ischemia-reperfusion Injury After Lung Transplantation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36648297/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Necroptosis, one of the types of regulated necrosis, causes ischemia-reperfusion (IR) lung injury. N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), a calpain inhibitor, is known to attenuate necroptosis and apoptosis, and the purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of ALLN during cold ischemia against IR injury in a rat lung transplant model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male Lewis rats (250-350 g) were divided into 3 groups: sham group (n = 4), nontransplantation; control group (n = 8), transplantation with IR lung injury; and ALLN group (n = 8), transplantation with IR lung injury/ALLN. Rats in the sham group underwent a simple thoracotomy, and the remaining 2 groups of rats underwent an orthotopic left lung transplant. Cold ischemic time was 15 h. After 2 h of reperfusion, physiological function, inflammatory cytokine expression, pathway activation, and the degrees of necroptosis and apoptosis were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Lung gas exchange (PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was significantly better, and pulmonary edema was significantly improved in the ALLN group compared with the control group (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0009, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0014). Plasma expression of interleukin-1β was significantly lower in the ALLN group than in the control group (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0313). The proportion of necroptotic and apoptotic cells was significantly lower in the ALLN group than in the control group (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0009), whereas the proportion of apoptotic cells remained unchanged (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.372); therefore, the calpain inhibitor was thought to suppress necroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The administration of ALLN during cold ischemia appears to improve IR lung injury in a lung transplant animal model via the inhibition of necroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The dysfunction of complement factor H (CFH), the main soluble complement negative regulator, potentiates various complement-induced renal injuries. However, insights into the underlying mechanism of CFH dysfunction remain limited. In this study, we investigated whether extracellular protease-mediated degradation accounts for CFH dysfunction in complement-mediated renal injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; An unbiased interactome of lupus mice kidneys identified CFH-binding protease. In vitro cleavage assay clarified CFH degradation. Pristane-induced SLE or renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury models were used in wild-type and ADAMTS7-/- mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We identified the metalloprotease ADAMTS7 as a CFH-binding protein in lupus kidneys. Moreover, the upregulation of ADAMTS7 correlated with CFH reduction in both lupus mice and patients. Mechanistically, ADAMTS7 is directly bound to CFH complement control protein (CCP) 1-4 domain and degraded CCP 1-7 domain through multiple cleavages. In mice with lupus nephritis or renal I/R injury, ADAMTS7 deficiency alleviated complement activation and related renal pathologies, but without affecting complement-mediated bactericidal activity. Adeno-associated virus-mediated CFH silencing compromised these protective effects of ADAMTS7 knockout against complement-mediated renal injuries in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; ADAMTS7-mediated CFH degradation potentiates complement activation and related renal injuries. ADAMTS7 would be a promising anticomplement therapeutic target that does not increase bacterial infection risk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TFEB-mediated lysosomal exocytosis alleviates high fat diet-induced lipotoxicity in the kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36649084/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a major risk factor for end-stage kidney disease. We previously found that lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagic flux contributed to lipotoxicity in obesity-related kidney disease, both in humans and experimental animal models. However, the regulatory factors involved in countering renal lipotoxicity are largely unknown. Here we found that palmitic acid (PA) strongly promoted dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) by inhibiting the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1 (MTORC1) pathway in a Rag GTPase-dependent manner, although these effects gradually diminished after extended treatment. We then investigated the role of TFEB in the pathogenesis of obesity-related kidney disease. Proximal tubular epithelial cell (PTEC)-specific Tfeb-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibited greater phospholipid accumulation in enlarged lysosomes, which manifested as multilamellar bodies (MLBs). Activated TFEB mediated lysosomal exocytosis of phospholipids, which help reduce MLB accumulation in PTECs. Furthermore, HFD-fed PTEC-specific Tfeb-deficient mice showed autophagic stagnation and exacerbated injury upon renal ischemia-reperfusion. Finally, higher body mass index was associated with increased vacuolation and decreased nuclear TFEB in the proximal tubules of chronic kidney disease patients. These results indicate a critical role of TFEB-mediated lysosomal exocytosis in counteracting renal lipotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Timing and cell specificity of senescence drives postnatal lung development and injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36650158/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senescence causes age-related diseases and stress-related injury. Paradoxically, it is also essential for organismal development. Whether senescence contributes to lung development or injury in early life remains unclear. Here, we show that lung senescence occurred at birth and decreased throughout the saccular stage in mice. Reducing senescent cells at this stage disrupted lung development. In mice (&amp;lt;12 h old) exposed to hyperoxia during the saccular stage followed by air recovery until adulthood, lung senescence increased particularly in type II cells and secondary crest myofibroblasts. This peaked during the alveolar stage and was mediated by the p53/p21 pathway. Decreasing senescent cells during the alveolar stage attenuated hyperoxia-induced alveolar and vascular simplification. Conclusively, early programmed senescence orchestrates postnatal lung development whereas later hyperoxia-induced senescence causes lung injury through different mechanisms. This defines the ontogeny of lung senescence and provides an optimal therapeutic window for mitigating neonatal hyperoxic lung injury by inhibiting senescence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The level of linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) has been proved to be a sensor of cell state, but its relationship with hyperoxia-induced alveolar type 2 epithelial cells injure and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not been clarified. In this study, we evaluated if these effects ultimately led to functional damage in hyperoxia-induced alveolar cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We treated RLE-6TN cells at 85% hyperoxia for 0, 24 and 48 h with Thiamet G (TG), an OGA inhibitor; OSMI-1 (OS), an OGT inhibitor; or with UDP-GlcNAc, which is involved in synthesis of O-GlcNAc as a donor. The metabolic rerouting, cell viability and apoptosis resulting from the changes in O-GlcNAc glycosyltransferase levels were evaluated in RLE-6TN cells after hyperoxia exposure. We constructed rat Park2 overexpression and knockdown plasmmids for in vitro verification and Co-immunoprecipitation corroborated the binding of Parkin and O-GlcNAc. Finally, we assessed morphological detection in neonatal BPD rats with TG and OS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found a decrease in O-GlcNAc content and levels of its metabolic enzymes in RLE-6TN cells under hyperoxia. However, the inhibition of OGT function with OSMI-1 ameliorated hyperoxia-induced lung epithelial cell injury, enhanced cell metabolism and viability, reduced apoptosis, and accelerated the cell proliferation. Mitochondrial homeostasis was affected by O-GlcNAc and regulated Parkin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The results revealed that the decreased O-GlcNAc levels and increased O-GlcNAcylation of Parkin might cause hyperoxia-induced alveolar type II cells injurys.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulatory T cell and macrophage crosstalk in acute lung injury: future perspectives</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36646692/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) describes the injury to endothelial cells in the lungs and associated vessels due to various factors. Furthermore, ALI accompanied by inflammation and thrombosis has been reported as a common complication of SARS-COV-2 infection. It is widely accepted that inflammation and the cytokine storm are main causes of ALI. Two classical anti-inflammatory cell types, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2 macrophages, are theoretically capable of resisting uncontrolled inflammation. Recent studies have indicated possible crosstalk between Tregs and macrophages involving their mutual activation. In this review, we discuss the current findings related to ALI pathogenesis and the role of Tregs and macrophages. In particular, we review the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between Tregs and macrophages in ALI pathogenesis. Understanding the role of Tregs and macrophages will provide the potential targets for treating ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and macrophages are responsible for acute lung injury (ALI) progression through pro-/anti-inflammatory cell balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tregs and macrophages influence each other to potentiate their roles in ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the mutual interaction, new application of conventional drugs and novel insights of ALI treatment are generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The specific Treg–macrophage crosslink in different stage of ALI needs more investigations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The curative effects of application of conventional drugs and new immunological therapy should be performed in precise clinical verifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proper control of Treg or M2 macrophage expansion in ALI treatment expects further studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Adaptor protein HIP-55-mediated signalosome protects against ferroptosis in myocardial infarction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36639542/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Myocardial infarction (MI) results in cardiac damage due to cell death and insufficient cardiomyocyte self-renewal. Ferroptosis, a novel type of cell death, has recently been shown as a key cause of cardiomyocyte death after MI. However, the complicated regulation mechanisms involved in ferroptosis, especially how ferroptosis is integrated into classical cell survival/death pathways, are still unclear. Here, we discovered that HIP-55, a novel adaptor protein, acts as a hub protein for the integration of the ferroptosis mechanism into the classical AKT cell survival and MAP4K1 cell death pathways for MI injury. The expression of HIP-55 is induced in MI. Genetic deletion of HIP-55 increased cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and MI injury, whereas cardiac-specific overexpression of HIP-55 significantly alleviated cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and MI injury. Mechanistically, HIP-55 was identified as a new AKT substrate. AKT phosphorylates HIP-55 at S269/T291 sites and further HIP-55 directs AKT signaling to negatively regulate the MAP4K1 pathway against MI injury in a site-specific manner. S269A/T291A-mutated HIP-55 (HIP-55AA), which is defective in AKT phosphorylation and significantly decreases the interaction between HIP-55 and MAP4K1, failed to inhibit the MAP4K1/GPX4 ferroptosis pathway. In line with this mechanism, cardiac-specific overexpression of HIP-55WT mice, but not cardiac-specific overexpression of HIP-55AA mice, protected cardiomyocytes against MI-induced ferroptosis and cardiac injury in vivo. These findings suggest that HIP-55 rewired the classical AKT (cell survival) and MAPK (cell death) pathways into ferroptosis mechanism in MI injury. HIP-55 may be a new therapeutic target for myocardial damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lineage Tracing and Single-Nucleus Multiomics Reveal Novel Features of Adaptive and Maladaptive Repair after Acute Kidney Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36735940/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; AKI triggers a proliferative response as part of an intrinsic cellular repair program, which can lead to adaptive renal repair, restoring kidney structure and function, or maladaptive repair with the persistence of injured proximal tubule cells (PTCs) and an altered kidney structure. However, the cellular and molecular understanding of these repair programs is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To examine chromatin and transcriptional responses in the same cell upon ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), we combined genetic fate mapping of cycling (Ki67+) cells labeled early after IRI with single-nucleus multiomics-profiling transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in the same nucleus-and generated a dataset of 83,315 nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; AKI triggered a broad cell cycle response preceded by cell type-specific and global transcriptional changes in the nephron, the collecting and vascular systems, and stromal and immune cell types. We observed a heterogeneous population of maladaptive PTCs throughout proximal tubule segments 6 months post-AKI, with a marked loss of maladaptive cells from 4 weeks to 6 months. Gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiling in the same nuclei highlighted differences between adaptive and maladaptive PTCs in the activity of &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-regulatory elements and transcription factors, accompanied by corresponding changes in target gene expression. Adaptive repair was associated with reduced expression of genes encoding transmembrane transport proteins essential to kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Analysis of genome organization and gene activity with single-cell resolution using lineage tracing and single-nucleus multiomics offers new insight into the regulation of renal injury repair. Weeks to months after mild-to-moderate IRI, maladaptive PTCs persist with an aberrant epigenetic landscape, and PTCs exhibit an altered transcriptional profile even following adaptive repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anti-angiogenic effect of exo-LncRNA TUG1 in myocardial infarction and modulation by remote ischemic conditioning</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36635484/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successful use of exosomes in therapy after myocardial infarction depends on an improved understanding of their role in cardiac signaling and regulation. Here, we report that exosomes circulating after myocardial infarction (MI) carry LncRNA TUG1 which downregulates angiogenesis by disablement of the HIF-1α/VEGF-α axis and that this effect can be counterbalanced by remote ischemic conditioning (RIC). Rats with MI induced through left coronary artery ligation without (MI model) and with reperfusion (ischemia/reperfusion I/R model) were randomized to RIC, or MI (I/R) or sham-operated (SO) control. Data from one cohort study and one randomized-controlled trial of humans with MI were also utilized, the former involving patients who had not received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and the latter patients with PCI. Exosome concentrations did not differ between intervention groups (RIC vs. control) in rats (MI and I/R model) as well as humans (with and without PCI). However, MI and I/R exosomes attenuated HIF-1α, VEGF-α, and endothelial function. LncRNA TUG1 was increased in MI and I/R exosomes, but decreased in SO and RIC exosomes. HIF-1α expression was downregulated with MI and I/R exosomes but increased with RIC exosomes. Exosome inhibition suppressed HIF-1α upregulation through RIC exosomes. VEGF-α was identified as HIF-1α-regulated target gene. Knockdown of HIF-1α decreased VEGF-α, endothelial cell capability, and tube formation. Overexpression of HIF-1α exerted opposite effects. Transfection and co-transfection of 293 T cells with exosome-inhibitor GW4869 and HIF-1α inhibitor si-HIF-1α confirmed the exosomal-LncRNA TUG1/HIF-1α/VEGF-α pathway. LncRNA TUG1 is a potential therapeutic target after MI with or without reperfusion through PCI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GPR97 deficiency ameliorates renal interstitial fibrosis in mouse hypertensive nephropathy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36635422/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36635422/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypertensive nephropathy (HTN) ranks as the second-leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Accumulating evidence suggests that persistent hypertension injures tubular cells, leading to tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF), which is involved in the pathogenesis of HTN. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are implicated in many important pathological and physiological processes and act as important drug targets. In this study, we explored the intrarenal mechanisms underlying hypertension-associated TIF, and particularly, the potential role of GPR97, a member of the adhesion GPCR subfamily, in TIF. A deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)/salt-induced hypertensive mouse model was used. We revealed a significantly upregulated expression of GPR97 in the kidneys, especially in renal tubules, of the hypertensive mice and 10 patients with biopsy-proven hypertensive kidney injury. GPR97-/- mice showed markedly elevated blood pressure, which was comparable to that of wild-type mice following DOCA/salt treatment, but dramatically ameliorated renal injury and TIF. In NRK-52E cells, we demonstrated that knockdown of GPR97 suppressed the activation of TGF-β signaling by disturbing small GTPase RhoA-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization, thus inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis of TGF-β receptors and subsequent Smad activation. Collectively, this study demonstrates that GPR97 contributes to hypertension-associated TIF at least in part by facilitating TGF-β signaling, suggesting that GPR97 is a pivotal intrarenal factor for TIF progression under hypertensive conditions, and therapeutic strategies targeting GPR97 may improve the outcomes of patients with HTN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lifelong exposure to high-altitude hypoxia in humans is associated with improved redox homeostasis and structural-functional adaptations of the neurovascular unit</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36633375/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-altitude (HA) hypoxia has the potential to alter the structural-functional integrity of the neurovascular unit (NVU) in humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the first time, we examined to what extent chronic and lifelong hypoxia impacts multimodal biomarkers reflecting NVU structure-function in lowlanders and native Andean highlanders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite lowlanders presenting with a reduction in systemic oxidative-nitrosative stress and maintained cerebral bioenergetic and cerebrovascular function during chronic hypoxia, there was evidence for increased axonal injury and cognitive impairment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared to lowlanders at sea-level, highlanders exhibited elevated vascular NO bioavailability, improved dynamic regulatory capacity and cerebrovascular reactivity, comparable cerebral substrate delivery, neurovascular coupling and maintained cognition. Unlike lowlanders following chronic-HA, highlanders presented with lower concentrations of S100B, neurofilament-light chain and total-tau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These findings highlight novel integrated adaptations towards the regulation of the NVU in highlanders that may represent a neuroprotective phenotype underpinning successful adaptation to the lifelong stress of HA hypoxia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-altitude (HA) hypoxia may alter the structural-functional integrity of the neurovascular unit (NVU). Herein, we compared male lowlanders (n = 9) at sea-level (SL) and after 14-days acclimatization to 4,300 m (chronic HA) in Cerro de Pasco (CdP), Péru (HA), against sex, age and body mass index-matched healthy highlanders (n = 9) native to CdP (lifelong-HA). Serum proteins were examined to reflect NVU integrity and venous blood assayed for free radicals and nitric oxide (NO). Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was examined in conjunction with cerebral substrate delivery, dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA), cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide (CVRCO2 ) and neurovascular coupling (NVC). Psychomotor tests were employed to examine cognitive function. Compared to lowlanders at SL, highlanders exhibited elevated plasma and red blood cell NO bioavailability (P = 0.005, d = 1.549 and P = 0.003, d = 1.681), improved anterior and posterior dCA (low frequency Gain: P = 0.029, d = -1.292 and P = 0.017, d = -1.255 respectively), elevated anterior CVRCO2 (P = 0.113, d = -0.852) and preserved cerebral substrate delivery and NVC (all P = &amp;gt;0.100). In highlanders, S100B, neurofilament light-chain and T-tau were consistently lower (P = 0.018, d = -1.244, P = 0.037, d = -1.075 and P = &amp;lt;0.001, d = -3.894, respectively) and cognition comparable (all P = &amp;gt;0.100) to lowlanders following chronic-HA. These findings highlight novel integrated adaptations towards regulation of the NVU in highlanders that may represent a neuroprotective phenotype underpinning successful adaptation to the lifelong stress of HA hypoxia. Abstract figure legend We determined how the hypoxia of high-altitude across the temporal continuum of chronic through to lifelong exposure impacts the neurovascular unit (NVU) phenotype and to what extent this is subject to altered redox homeostasis. Basal multimodal biomarkers reflecting NVU structure-function were determined in lowlanders at sea-level (lifelong normoxia) and after 2 weeks acclimatization to 4,300 m (chronic hypoxia) in Cerro de Pasco, Péru (CdP) and compared to age/sex-matched highlanders native to CdP (lifelong hypoxia). Compared to acclimatized lowlanders, highlanders were characterized by elevated systemic nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, improved dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) and cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide (CVRCO2 ) and lower concentrations of S100B, neurofilament-light chain (NF-L) and total tau (T-Tau) in the face of preserved cerebral bioenergetics and cognition. Collectively, our novel findings tentatively suggest that these integrated adaptations may collectively reflect a neuroprotective phenotype to cope with the lifelong stress of high-altitude hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective effect of soloxolone derivatives in carrageenan- and LPS-driven acute inflammation: Pharmacological profiling and their effects on key inflammation-related processes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36640672/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36640672/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soloxolone derivatives (SDs) effectively ameliorate carrageenan-induced inflammation and LPS-stimulated ALI in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SDs suppress the expression of key inflammatory genes in inflamed sites and the functional activity of murine macrophages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SDs inhibit macrophage NO production by both suppression of Nos2 expression and probable direct interaction with iNOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soloxolone methyl (SM) displays cytoprotective effect on inflamed pneumocytes and does not affect their ALI-driven EMT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SM directly inhibits the activity of thrombin involved in the regulation of inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-inflammatory potential of three cyanoenone-containing triterpenoids, including soloxolone methyl (SM), soloxolone (S) and its novel derivative bearing at the C-30 amidoxime moiety (SAO), was studied in murine models of acute inflammation. It was found that the compounds effectively suppressed the development of carrageenan-induced paw edema and peritonitis as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-driven acute lung injury (ALI) with therapeutic outcomes comparable with that of the reference drugs indomethacin and dexamethasone. Non-immunogenic carrageenan-stimulated inflammation was more sensitive to the transformation of C-30 of SM compared with immunogenic LPS-induced inflammation: the anti-inflammatory properties of the studied compounds against carrageenan-induced paw edema and peritonitis decreased in the order of SAO &amp;gt; S &amp;gt; &amp;gt; SM, whereas the efficiency of these triterpenoids against LPS-driven ALI was similar (SAO ≈ S ≈ SM). Further studies demonstrated that soloxolone derivatives significantly inhibited a range of immune-related processes, including granulocyte influx and the expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the inflamed sites as well as the functional activity of macrophages. Moreover, SM was found to prevent inflammation-associated apoptosis of A549 pneumocytes and effectively inhibited the protease activity of thrombin (IC50 = 10.3 µM) tightly associated with rodent inflammatome. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that soloxolone derivatives can be considered as novel promising anti-inflammatory drug candidates with multi-targeted mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TREM2hi resident macrophages protect the septic heart by maintaining cardiomyocyte homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36635449/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM) is common in septic patients with a high mortality and is characterized by an abnormal immune response. Owing to cellular heterogeneity, understanding the roles of immune cell subsets in SICM has been challenging. Here we identify a unique subpopulation of cardiac-resident macrophages termed CD163&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;RETNLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Mac1), which undergoes self-renewal during sepsis and can be targeted to prevent SICM. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing with fate mapping in a mouse model of sepsis, we demonstrate that the Mac1 subpopulation has distinct transcriptomic signatures enriched in endocytosis and displays high expression of TREM2 (TREM2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;). TREM2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Mac1 cells actively scavenge cardiomyocyte-ejected dysfunctional mitochondria. &lt;em&gt;Trem2&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in macrophages impairs the self-renewal capability of the Mac1 subpopulation and consequently results in defective elimination of damaged mitochondria, excessive inflammatory response in cardiac tissue, exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and decreased survival. Notably, intrapericardial administration of TREM2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Mac1 cells prevents SICM. Our findings suggest that the modulation of TREM2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Mac1 cells could serve as a therapeutic strategy for SICM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of lung damage originating from excessive inflammation and cytokine release during various types of infections remains relevant and stimulates the search for highly effective and safe drugs. The biological activity of the latter may be associated with the regulation of hyperactivation of certain immune cells and enzymes. Here, we propose the design and synthesis of amino derivatives of 4,6- and 5,7-diaryl substituted pyrimidines and [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines as promising double-acting pharmacophores inhibiting IL-6 and NO. The anti-inflammatory activity of 14 target compounds was studied on isolated primary murine macrophages after LPS stimulation. Seven compounds were identified to inhibit the synthesis of nitric oxide and interleukin 6 at a concentration of 100 µM. The most active compounds are micromolar inhibitors of IL-6 secretion and NO synthesis, showing a minimal impact on innate immunity, unlike the reference drug dexamethasone, along with acceptable cytotoxicity. Evaluation in an animal model of acute lung injury proved the protective activity of compound 6e, which was supported by biochemical, cytological and morphological markers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD16&#43; natural killer cells in bronchoalveolar lavage are associated with antibody-mediated rejection and chronic lung allograft dysfunction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute and chronic rejections limit the long-term survival after lung transplant. Pulmonary antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is an incompletely understood driver of long-term outcomes characterized by donor-specific antibodies (DSAs), innate immune infiltration, and evidence of complement activation. Natural killer (NK) cells may recognize DSAs via the CD16 receptor, but this complement-independent mechanism of injury has not been explored in pulmonary AMR. CD16+ NK cells were quantified in 508 prospectively collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 195 lung transplant recipients. Associations between CD16+ NK cells and human leukocyte antigen mismatches, DSAs, and AMR grade were assessed by linear models adjusted for participant characteristics and repeat measures. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess CD16+ NK cell association with chronic lung allograft dysfunction and survival. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid CD16+ NK cell frequency was associated with increasing human leukocyte antigens mismatches and increased AMR grade. Although NK frequencies were similar between DSA+ and DSA- recipients, CD16+ NK cell frequencies were greater in recipients with AMR and those with concomitant allograft dysfunction. CD16+ NK cells were associated with long-term graft dysfunction after AMR and decreased chronic lung allograft dysfunction-free survival. These data support the role of CD16+ NK cells in pulmonary AMR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exposure to polystyrene microplastics triggers lung injury via targeting toll-like receptor 2 and activation of the NF-κB signal in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36641069/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are ubiquitous pollutants with a wide range of plastic applications. More recently, microplastics are in the air and can be inhaled into the lungs, causing respiratory diseases. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms by which microplastics may induce respiratory disease is still limited. This study used intranasal instillation to develop a model of lung injury. The histopathology result showed that the mouse lung had severe inflammatory responses, apoptosis and collagen deposition with chronic exposure to different sizes (Small: 1–5 μm and Large: 10–20 μm) of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPS), and the damage of smaller sizes was obvious. The expression levels of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) family, evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors, were detected, and the levels of TLR2 mRNA was significantly increased. In transfection experiments, PS-MPS increased the inflammatory response in HEK293 cells with TLR2 expression. Furthermore, exposure to small polystyrene microplastics promoted oxidative stress and apoptosis, and accelerated the process of fibrosis. Interestingly, inhibition of the NF-κB signal relieves inflammation and oxidative stress, reduces apoptosis, and thus controls the fibrosis process. These results suggested that PS-MPS targeted binding to TLR2 and further exacerbated fibrosis by facilitating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis with the activation of NF-κB signal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicle-encapsulated CC16 as novel nanotherapeutics for treatment of acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is still associated with high mortality. Growing evidence suggests that Club Cell Protein 16 (CC16) plays a protective role against ALI. However, the doses of recombinant CC16 (rCC16) used in preclinical studies are supraphysiological for clinical applications. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanovesicles endogenously generated by mammalian cells. Our study demonstrated that CC16 is released via small EVs and EV-encapsulated CC16 (sEV-CC16) has anti-inflammatory activities, which protect mice from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or bacteria-induced ALI. Additionally, sEV-CC16 can activate the DNA damage repair signaling pathways. Consistent with this activity, we observed more severe DNA damage in lungs from Cc16 knockout (KO) than wild-type (WT) mice. Mechanistically, we elucidated that CC16 suppresses NF-κB signaling activation by binding to Heat Shock Protein 60 (HSP60). We concluded that sEV-CC16 could be a potential therapeutic agent for ALI by inhibiting the inflammatory and DNA damage responses by reducing NF-κB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long Noncoding RNA: A Novel Insight into the Pathogenesis of Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36675533/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), represent an acute stage of lung inflammation where the alveolar epithelium loses its functionality. ALI has a devastating impact on the population as it not only has a high rate of incidence, but also has high rates of morbidity and mortality. Due to the involvement of multiple factors, the pathogenesis of ALI is complex and is not fully understood yet. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of non-protein-coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. Growing evidence has shown that lncRNAs have a decisive role in the pathogenesis of ALI. LncRNAs can either promote or hinder the development of ALI in various cell types in the lungs. Mechanistically, current studies have found that lncRNAs play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of ALI via the regulation of small RNAs (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, microRNAs) or downstream proteins. Undoubtedly, lncRNAs not only have the potential to reveal the underlying mechanisms of ALI pathogenesis but also serve as diagnostic and therapeutic targets for the therapy of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LONP1 targets HMGCS2 to protect mitochondrial function and attenuate chronic kidney disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria comprise the central metabolic hub of cells and their imbalance plays a pathogenic role in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here, we studied Lon protease 1 (LONP1), a major mitochondrial protease, as its role in CKD pathogenesis is unclear. LONP1 expression was decreased in human patients and mice with CKD, and tubular-specific Lonp1 overexpression mitigated renal injury and mitochondrial dysfunction in two different models of CKD, but these outcomes were aggravated by Lonp1 deletion. These results were confirmed in renal tubular epithelial cells in vitro. Mechanistically, LONP1 downregulation caused mitochondrial accumulation of the LONP1 substrate, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2), which disrupted mitochondrial function and further accelerated CKD progression. Finally, computer-aided virtual screening was performed, which identified a novel LONP1 activator. Pharmacologically, the LONP1 activator attenuated renal fibrosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Collectively, these results imply that LONP1 is a promising therapeutic target for treating CKD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-20a-5p alleviates kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury by targeting ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36695612/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is prone to occur after kidney transplantation, leading to delayed graft function (DGF). MicroRNAs play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury, and miR-20a-5p was found to be the most significantly upregulated gene in a DGF patient cohort. However, the roles of microRNAs in transplanted kidneys remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that miR-20a-5p was upregulated in the kidneys of acute kidney injury mice and in patients with DGF. We identified early growth response-1 as a critical upstream target and verified the binding of early growth response-1 to a predicted sequence in the promoter region of the miR-20a-5p gene. Functionally, the miR-20a-5p mimic attenuated IRI and postischemic renal fibrosis, whereas the miR-20a-5p inhibitor delivery aggravated IRI and fibrosis. Importantly, delivery of the miR-20a-5p mimic or inhibitor in the donor kidneys attenuated or aggravated renal loss and structural damage in cold storage transplantation injury. Furthermore, our study identified miR-20a-5p as a negative regulator of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) by targeting the 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated region of ACSL4 mRNA, thereby inhibiting ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis. Our results suggest a potential therapeutic application of miR-20a-5p in kidney transplantation through the inhibition of ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial transplant after ischemia reperfusion promotes cellular salvage and improves lung function during ex-vivo lung perfusion</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36707296/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In lung transplantation, ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with mitochondrial damage can lead to graft rejection. Intact, exogenous mitochondria provide a unique treatment option to salvage damaged cells within lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We developed a novel method to freeze and store allogeneic mitochondria isolated from porcine heart tissue. Stored mitochondria were injected into a model of induced ischemia-reperfusion injury using porcine &lt;em&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/em&gt; lung perfusion. Treatment benefits to immune modulation, antioxidant defense, and cellular salvage were evaluated. These findings were corroborated in human lungs undergoing &lt;em&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/em&gt; lung perfusion. Lung tissue homogenate and primary lung endothelial cells were then used to address underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Following cold ischemia, mitochondrial transplant reduced lung pulmonary vascular resistance and tissue pro-inflammatory signaling and cytokine secretion. Further, exogenous mitochondria reduced reactive oxygen species by-products and promoted glutathione synthesis, thereby salvaging cell viability. These results were confirmed in a human model of &lt;em&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/em&gt; lung perfusion wherein transplanted mitochondria decreased tissue oxidative and inflammatory signaling, improving lung function. We demonstrate that transplanted mitochondria induce autophagy and suggest that bolstered autophagy may act upstream of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. Importantly, chemical inhibitors of the MEK autophagy pathway blunted the favorable effects of mitochondrial transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These data provide direct evidence that mitochondrial transplant improves cellular health and lung function when administered during &lt;em&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/em&gt; lung perfusion and suggest the mechanism of action may be through promotion of cellular autophagy. Data herein contribute new insights into the therapeutic potential of mitochondrial transplant to abate ischemia-reperfusion injury during lung transplant, and thus reduce graft rejection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B inhibits the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B prevents the production of ROS and reduced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B alleviates pulmonary edema, reverses inflammatory mediator TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-β secretion in lung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a devastating respiratory disorder characterized by rapid alveolar injury, uncontrolled inflammatory response, etc. Onychiol B is a cyathane diterpene originally isolated from fern plants. In this study, onychiol B can inhibit the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as NO, iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells by restraining the NF-κB and the p38 MAPK pathway. In addition, it prevents the production of ROS and reduces the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, in the acute lung injury mouse model induced by LPS injected into the trachea, onychiol B alleviates pulmonary edema, reverses inflammatory mediator TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-β secretion in lung. In general, our data show that significant anti-ALI effects of onychiol B would render it a potential candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sesamolin Attenuates Kidney Injury, Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction, and Gut Microbiota Imbalance in High-Fat and High-Fructose Diet-Fed Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36630317/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the effects of sesamolin on kidney injury, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and gut microbiota imbalance in high-fat and high-fructose (HF-HF) diet-fed mice and explored the underlying correlations among them. The results indicated that sesamolin suppressed metabolic disorders and increased renal function parameters. Histological evaluation showed that sesamolin mitigated renal epithelial cell degeneration and brush border damage. Meanwhile, sesamolin inhibited the endotoxin-mediated induction of the Toll-like receptor 4-related IKKα/NF-κB p65 pathway activation. Additionally, sesamolin mitigated intestinal barrier dysfunction and improved the composition of gut microbiota. The correlation results further indicated that changes in the dominant phyla, including &lt;em&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deferribacterota&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Desulfobacterota&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroidota&lt;/em&gt;, were more highly correlated with a reduction in endotoxemia and metabolic disorders, as well as decreases in intestinal proinflammatory response and related renal risk biomarkers. The results of this study suggest that sesamolin attenuates kidney injuries, which might be associated with its effects on the reduction of endotoxemia and related metabolic disorders through the restoration of the intestinal barrier and the modulation of gut microbiota. Thus, sesamolin may be a potential dietary supplement for protection against obesity-associated kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alpha-1 antitrypsin limits neutrophil extracellular trap disruption of airway epithelial barrier function</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps contribute to lung injury in cystic fibrosis and asthma, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We sought to understand the impact of human NETs on barrier function in primary human bronchial epithelial and a human airway epithelial cell line. We demonstrate that NETs disrupt airway epithelial barrier function by decreasing transepithelial electrical resistance and increasing paracellular flux, partially by NET-induced airway cell apoptosis. NETs selectively impact the expression of tight junction genes claudins 4, 8 and 11. Bronchial epithelia exposed to NETs demonstrate visible gaps in E-cadherin staining, a decrease in full-length E-cadherin protein and the appearance of cleaved E-cadherin peptides. Pretreatment of NETs with alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) inhibits NET serine protease activity, limits E-cadherin cleavage, decreases bronchial cell apoptosis and preserves epithelial integrity. In conclusion, NETs disrupt human airway epithelial barrier function through bronchial cell death and degradation of E-cadherin, which are limited by exogenous A1AT.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>microRNA-33 deficiency in macrophages enhances autophagy, improves mitochondrial homeostasis, and protects against lung fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36626225/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease. Recent findings have shown a marked metabolic reprogramming associated with changes in mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy during pulmonary fibrosis. The microRNA-33 (miR-33) family of microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded within the introns of SREBP (sterol regulatory element binding protein) genes are master regulators of sterol and fatty acid (FA) metabolism. miR-33 controls macrophage immuno-metabolic response and enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, FA oxidation, and cholesterol efflux. Here, we show that miR-33 levels are increased in Broncho Alveolar Lavage (BAL) cells isolated from IPF patients compared to healthy controls. We demonstrate that specific genetic ablation of miR-33 in macrophages protects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The absence of miR-33 in macrophages improves mitochondrial homeostasis and increases autophagy while decreasing inflammatory response after bleomycin injury. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of miR-33 in macrophages via administration of anti-miR-33 Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNA-33) attenuates fibrosis in different &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; mice and human models of pulmonary fibrosis. Together, these studies elucidate a major role of miR-33 in macrophages in the regulation of pulmonary fibrosis and uncover a novel therapeutic approach to treat this disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular imaging of chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) in experimental acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36626557/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study developed a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent that detects pulmonary inflammation during acute lung injury. The PET radiotracer uptake was highest in lung regions with high macrophage influx, and quantification of radiotracer uptake strongly correlated with the expression of established inflammatory markers. Further, this PET tracer was able to monitor treatment response to a clinically relevant treatment, providing information beyond what would be obtained by other imaging modalities, like computed tomography, alone. This knowledge will enhance our ability to noninvasively characterize and monitor molecular patterns of inflammation to help develop precision medicine approaches to treat the acutely injured lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of techniques for noninvasive imaging of inflammation has challenged precision medicine management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here, we determined the potential of positron emission tomography (PET) of chemokine-like receptor-1 (CMKLR1) to monitor lung inflammation in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide-induced injury. Lung uptake of a CMKLR1-targeting radiotracer, [&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu]NODAGA-CG34, was significantly increased in lipopolysaccharide-induced injury, correlated with the expression of multiple inflammatory markers, and reduced by dexamethasone treatment. Monocyte-derived macrophages, followed by interstitial macrophages and monocytes were the major CMKLR1-expressing leukocytes contributing to the increased tracer uptake throughout the first week of lipopolysaccharide-induced injury. The clinical relevance of CMKLR1 as a biomarker of lung inflammation in ARDS was confirmed using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets which showed significant increases in &lt;em&gt;CMKLR1&lt;/em&gt; expression among transcriptionally distinct subsets of lung monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 patients vs. controls. CMKLR1-targeted PET is a promising strategy to monitor the dynamics of lung inflammation and response to anti-inflammatory treatment in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1324 Protein Contributes to Mycobacterial Persistence and Causes Pathological Lung Injury in Mice by Inducing Ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36625672/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; (Mtb) is the pathogenic agent of tuberculosis (TB). Intracellular survival plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Mtb, a process that depends on an array of virulence factors for Mtb to colonize and proliferate within a host. Reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNS and ROS) are among the most effective antimycobacterial molecules generated by the host during infection. However, Mtb has evolved a number of proteins and enzymes to detoxify ROS and RNS. Secretory protein Rv1324, as a possible thioredoxin, might also have oxidoreductase activity against ROS and RNS during Mtb infection, and it is a potential virulence factor of Mtb. In this study, we investigated the biochemical properties of Mtb Rv1324 and its role in mycobacterial survival and virulence. The results showed that the Rv1324 protein had antioxidant activity and increased the survival of &lt;em&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/em&gt; that was exposed to ROS and RNS. In addition, Rv1324 enhanced the colonization ability of &lt;em&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/em&gt; in the lungs of mice. Further, mice infected with &lt;em&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/em&gt; harboring Rv1324 exhibited pathological injury and inflammation in the lung, which was mediated by ferroptosis. In summary, this study advances our understanding of the mechanisms of mycobacterial survival and pathogenesis, and it reveals a novel target for TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intracellular survival of &lt;em&gt;M. tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; (Mtb) plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis, which depends on various Mtb oxidoreductases that are resistant to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) that are generated by the host during Mtb infection. Secretory protein Rv1324 is a potential virulence factor of Mtb and is a possible thioredoxin that has oxidoreductase activity against ROS and RNS during Mtb infection. We investigated the biochemical properties of Mtb Rv1324 and its role in mycobacterial survival and virulence. It was confirmed that the Rv1324 protein had antioxidant activity and an increased mycobacterial resistance to ROS and RNS. In addition, Rv1324 enhanced mycobacterial persistence and induced pathological injury and inflammation in the lungs of mice by activating ferroptosis. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms of mycobacterial survival and pathogenesis, and it reveals a novel target for TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myofibroblast-Specific Inhibition of the Rho Kinase-MRTF-SRF Pathway Using Nanotechnology for the Prevention of Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36625494/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of myofibroblasts in the lung and progressive tissue scarring. Fibroblasts exist across a spectrum of states, from quiescence in health to activated myofibroblasts in the setting of injury. Highly activated myofibroblasts have a critical role in the establishment of fibrosis as the predominant source of type 1 collagen and pro-fibrotic mediators. Myofibroblasts are also highly contractile cells and can alter lung biomechanical properties through tissue contraction. . One of the ways myofibroblast activation occurs is through activation of the Rho/myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) / serum response factor (SRF) pathway, which signals through intracellular actin polymerization. However, concerns surrounding the pleiotropic and ubiquitous nature of these signaling pathways have limited the translation of inhibitory drugs. Herein, we demonstrate a novel therapeutic anti-fibrotic strategy utilizing myofibroblast-targeted nanoparticles containing a MTRF/SRF pathway inhibitor (CCG-1423) which has been shown to block myofibroblast activation in vitro. Myofibroblasts were preferentially targeted via the angiotensin 2 receptor, which has been shown to be selectively upregulated in animal and human studies. These nanoparticles were non-toxic and accumulated in lung myofibroblasts in the bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, reducing the number of these activated cells and their production of pro-fibrotic mediators. Ultimately, in a murine model of lung fibrosis, a single injection of these drug containing targeted nanoagents reduced fibrosis as compared to control mice. This approach has the potential to deliver personalized therapy by precisely targeting signaling pathways in a cell-specific manner, allowing increased efficacy with reduced deleterious off-target effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of MR1-driven signals and amphiregulin on the recruitment and repair function of MAIT cells during skin wound healing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36630919/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue repair processes maintain proper organ function following mechanical or infection-related damage. In addition to antibacterial properties, mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells express a tissue repair transcriptomic program and promote skin wound healing when expanded. Herein, we use a human-like mouse model of full-thickness skin excision to assess the underlying mechanisms of MAIT cell tissue repair function. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis suggested that skin MAIT cells already express a repair program at steady state. Following skin excision, MAIT cells promoted keratinocyte proliferation, thereby accelerating healing. Using skin grafts, parabiosis, and adoptive transfer experiments, we show that MAIT cells migrated into the wound in a T cell receptor (TCR)-independent but CXCR6 chemokine receptor-dependent manner. Amphiregulin secreted by MAIT cells following excision promoted wound healing. Expression of the repair function was probably independent of sustained TCR stimulation. Overall, our study provides mechanistic insights into MAIT cell wound healing function in the skin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell transcriptomics reveals a mechanosensitive injury signaling pathway in early diabetic nephropathy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36627643/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, and histopathologic glomerular lesions are among the earliest structural alterations of DN. However, the signaling pathways that initiate these glomerular alterations are incompletely understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To delineate the cellular and molecular basis for DN initiation, we performed single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing of renal cells from type 2 diabetes mice (BTBR ob/ob) at the early stage of DN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed glucose-independent responses in glomerular cell types. The gene regulatory network upstream of glomerular cell programs suggested the activation of mechanosensitive transcriptional pathway MRTF-SRF predominantly taking place in mesangial cells. Importantly, activation of MRTF-SRF transcriptional pathway was also identified in DN glomeruli in independent patient cohort datasets. Furthermore, ex vivo kidney perfusion suggested that the regulation of MRTF-SRF is a common mechanism in response to glomerular hyperfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Overall, our study presents a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of early DN, highlighting mechanosensitive signaling pathways as novel targets of diabetic glomerulopathy.Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The main e-cigarette component vegetable glycerin enhances neutrophil migration and fibrosis in endotoxin-induced lung injury via p38 MAPK activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36627690/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the effects of vegetable glycerin (VG), a main e-cigarette constituent, on endotoxin-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Mice received intratracheal administration of 30% VG in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vehicle or only PBS (control) for 4 days. On Day 5, mice received an intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (LPS group and VG + LPS group) or PBS (VG group and control group). Lung histopathology, expression of chemokine receptors, and regulatory signaling were analyzed 24 h after the Day 5 treatment. VG significantly increased ALI-associated histopathological and fibrotic changes in both the VG group and LPS-induced ALI mice (VG + LPS group). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analyses revealed that VG administration resulted in upregulation of neutrophil markers [lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus G6D (Ly6G) and myeloperoxidase (MPO)] as well as upregulation of the expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a central mediator of fibrogenesis, in the lungs of both VG and VG + LPS groups. VG enhanced the expression of adhesion molecules [very late antigen 4 (VLA-4) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)] and increased activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) to prompt neutrophil recruitment in the lungs of mice with ALI. Intraperitoneal administration of a p38 inhibitor attenuated these histopathological changes significantly as well as VG-induced upregulation in expression of Ly6G, MPO, VLA-4, VCAM-1, TGF-β, and collagen-1 in mice with ALI. In conclusion, VG enhances neutrophil chemotaxis and fibrosis and it amplifies the inflammatory response associated with LPS-induced ALI in the lungs via enhancement of p38 MAPK activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of short-term high-concentration exposure to PM2.5 on pulmonary tissue damage and repair ability as well as innate immune events</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36632972/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-term heavy air pollution still occurs frequently worldwide, especially during the winter heating period in some developing countries, which is usually accompanied by the temporary explosive growth of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;. The pulmonary damage caused by PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure has been determined, but there have been few studies on the repair ability after the cessation of exposure and the important role of innate immune events. This study established a short-term (30 days) high-concentration (15 mg/kg body weight) PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure and recovery (15 days of exposure cessation) model by intratracheal instillation. The results showed that short-term PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure increased the content of collagen fiber in rat lung tissue, which was significantly repaired after recovery by 15 days of exposure cessation. Meanwhile, exposure to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; also caused changes in lung epithelial function, macrophage polarization and cell autophagy function. Most of these changes could be restored or reversed to a certain extent after recovery. However, there were also some biomarkers, including CLDN18.1, SP-A, SP-D, iNOS, CD206, Beclin1, p62 and LC3B, that were still significantly different between the exposure and control groups after recovery, suggesting that some toxic effects, especially epithelial function damage, were not completely repaired. In addition, there was a significant correlation between pulmonary fibrosis and innate immunity. The present study demonstrated that short-term high-concentration exposure to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; could cause temporary lung tissue damage and related innate immune events in rats, and the repair ability existed after the cessation of exposure, but part of the damage that required special attention still persisted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cationic phosphorus dendron nanomicelles deliver microRNA mimics and microRNA inhibitors for enhanced anti-inflammatory therapy of acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient nanomedicines to repress the repolarization of M1 phenotype macrophages and therefore inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression for anti-inflammatory therapy is still a challenging task. We report here an original gene delivery nanoplatform based on pyrrolidinium-modified amphiphilic generation 1 phosphorus dendron (C12G1) nanomicelles with a rigid phosphorous dendron structure. The nanomicelles display higher gene delivery efficiency than the counterpart materials of pyrrolidinium-modified G1 phosphorus dendrimers, and meanwhile exhibit excellent cytocompatibility. The C12G1 nanomicelles can be employed to co-deliver the miRNA-146a mimic (miR-146a mimic) and miRNA-429 inhibitor (miR-429i) to inhibit the Toll-like receptor-4 signaling pathway and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, respectively, thus causing repression of M1 phenotype alveolar macrophage polarization. The developed C12G1/miR-mixture polyplexes enable efficient therapy of lipopolysaccharide-activated alveolar macrophages &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and an acute lung injury mouse model &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. The generated cationic phosphorus dendron nanomicelles may hold promising potential for anti-inflammatory gene therapy of other inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immunity to the microbiota promotes sensory neuron regeneration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbiota-induced T cells accelerate sensory neuron regeneration upon injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Injury promotes the expression of IL-17RA in dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-17/IL-17RA axis promotes peripheral sensory neuron regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue immunity and responses to injury depend on the coordinated action and communication among physiological systems. Here, we show that, upon injury, adaptive responses to the microbiota directly promote sensory neuron regeneration. At homeostasis, tissue-resident commensal-specific T cells colocalize with sensory nerve fibers within the dermis, express a transcriptional program associated with neuronal interaction and repair, and promote axon growth and local nerve regeneration following injury. Mechanistically, our data reveal that the cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) released by commensal-specific Th17 cells upon injury directly signals to sensory neurons via IL-17 receptor A, the transcription of which is specifically upregulated in injured neurons. Collectively, our work reveals that in the context of tissue damage, preemptive immunity to the microbiota can rapidly bridge biological systems by directly promoting neuronal repair, while also identifying IL-17A as a major determinant of this fundamental process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WWOX activates autophagy to alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury by regulating mTOR</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36621327/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by acute systemic inflammatory responses that may lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The clinical course of ALI/ARDS is variable; however, it has been reported that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) play a role in its development. The fragile chromosomal site gene WWOX is highly sensitive to genotoxic stress induced by environmental exposure and is an important candidate gene for exposure-related lung disease research. However, the expression of WWOX and its role in LPS-induced ALI still remain unidentified. This study investigated the expression of WWOX in mouse lung and epithelial cells and explored the role of WWOX in LPS-induced ALI model in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we explored one of the possible mechanisms by which WWOX alleviates ALI from the perspective of autophagy. Here, we observed that LPS stimulation reduced the expression of WWOX and the autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3β-II (MAP1LC3B/LC3B) in mouse lung epithelial and human epithelial (H292) cells. Overexpression of WWOX led to the activation of autophagy and inhibited inflammatory responses in LPS-induced ALI cells and mouse model. More importantly, we found that WWOX interacts with mechanistic target of rapamycin [serine/threonine kinase] (mTOR) and regulates mTOR and ULK-1 signaling-mediated autophagy. Thus, reduced WWOX levels were associated with LPS-induced ALI. WWOX can activate autophagy in lung epithelial cells and protect against LPS-induced ALI, which is partly related to the mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD44-targeting Drug Delivery System of Exosomes Loading Forsythiaside A Combats Liver Fibrosis via Regulating NLRP3-mediated Pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36603210/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver fibrosis is a progressive pathological process induced by various stimuli and may progress to liver cirrhosis and cancer. Forsythiaside A (FA) is an active ingredient extracted from traditional Chinese medicine Forsythiae Fructus and has prominent hepatoprotective activities. However, the unsatisfactory pharmacokinetic properties restrict its clinical application. In this study, the nanocarrier of CD44-specific ligand Hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified milk-derived exosomes (mExo) encapsulated with FA (HA-mExo-FA) is developed. As a result, HA modification could deliver drug-loaded exosomes to the target cells and form a specific ligand-receptor interaction with CD44, thus improving the anti-liver fibrosis effect of FA. In vitro findings indicate that HA-mExo-FA could inhibit TGF-β1-induced LX2 cell proliferation, reduce α-SMA and collagen gene and protein levels, and promote the apoptosis of activated LX2 cells. In vivo results demonstrate that HA-mExo-FA could improve liver morphology and function changes in zebrafish larvae. The anti-liver fibrosis mechanism of HA-mExo-FA may be attributed to the inhibition of NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis. In addition, the effect of HA-mExo-FA on TAA-induced increase in NLRP3 production is attenuated by NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950. Collectively, this study demonstrates the promising application of HA-mExo-FA in drug delivery with high specificity and provides a powerful and novel delivery platform for liver fibrosis therapy.

      <title>Development of a 32-gene signature using machine learning for accurate prediction of inflammatory bowel disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36600111/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Numerous genes are implicated in the etiology of IBD, but the diagnosis of IBD is challenging. Here, XGBoost, a machine learning prediction model, has been used to distinguish IBD from healthy cases following elaborative feature selection. Using combined unsupervised clustering analysis and the XGBoost feature selection method, we successfully identified a 32-gene signature that can predict IBD occurrence in new cohorts with 0.8651 accuracy. The signature shows enrichment in neutrophil extracellular trap formation and cytokine signaling in the immune system. The probability threshold of the XGBoost-based classification model can be adjusted to fit personalized lifestyle and health status. Therefore, this study reveals potential IBD-related biomarkers that facilitate an effective personalized diagnosis of IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A method for preparing hydrogels with parallel wavy fibers was developed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATA with a bionic double-layer structure was prepared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATA has bionic mechanical properties and biocompatibility and can repair TA injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This approach could provide a common platform for future tissue analog preparations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian tunica albuginea (TA) is characterized by a double-layer orthogonal structure composed of stacked parallel wavy collagen fibers. During an erection, these fibers undergo sequential straightening and stretching to mediate the soft-to-firm transition. Inspired by the delicate strain-adaptive structure of natural TA, we propose an artificial TA (ATA) composed of a strain-stiffening hydrogel consisting of aligned yet crimped fibers. This delicate structure is produced via the stretching of an isotropic polyvinyl alcohol gel followed by covalent cross-linking. ATA possesses several key mechanical features of natural TA, including rapid strain stiffening over small intervals of deformation, excellent fatigue resistance to sustain cyclic bursts, and high toughness to withstand pointwise acupuncture during suturing. Furthermore, ATA displays the capability to repair injuries and restore normal erectile function of the TA-damaged penile tissue in a pig model. Our study demonstrates that ATA has great promise for penile injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress and potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mammalian tunica albuginea (TA) is characterized by a double-layer orthogonal structure composed of stacked parallel wavy collagen fibrils. A TA mimic fiber with directional crimping was synthesized in this study by stretching an isotropic polyvinyl alcohol gel followed by covalent cross-linking to permanently fix the parallel aligned curved structures. Similar to the sequential response of the crimped structure in natural TA, the curved fibers first straighten to absorb strain and then stretch to induce a soft-to-firm transition. The proposed method paves the way for building a variety of weight-bearing organizations. Through the imitation of the structure, performance matching can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Donor and recipient human leukocyte antigen-G polymorphisms modulate the risk of adverse immunologic events following lung transplantation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36695689/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term benefits of lung transplantation (LTx) are limited by pathogenic alloimmune responses that drive injury, inflammation, and chronic dysfunction. Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) plays a key role in the modulation of these pathways. This study assesses the impact of the HLA-G genotype on immunologic risk and survival following LTx. This retrospective cohort study included 289 bilateral LTx. Recipient and donor HLA-G genotypes were analyzed to identify associations with de novo donor-specific antibodies, acute rejection, chronic lung allograft dysfunction, and allograft survival. We further assessed these associations, both individually and in paired analysis, based on a grouped haplotype classification of HLA-G expression. Donor HLA-G single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with allograft injury, the onset of chronic lung allograft dysfunction following injury, and allograft survival. Recipient HLA-G single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with allograft injury, cellular rejection, and donor-specific antibody formation. &amp;ldquo;Low HLA-G expression&amp;rdquo; donor haplotypes were associated with impaired allograft survival, as were &amp;ldquo;low HLA-G expression&amp;rdquo; donor-recipient haplotype pairs. This study provides compelling evidence for the role of HLA-G in modulating immunologic risk after LTx. Our results highlight the importance of both donor and recipient HLA-G genotypes on the overall risk profile and underscore the lasting influence of donor genotype on lung transplant outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL-99 ameliorates colitis-related lung injury in mice by modulating short-chain fatty acid production and inflammatory monocytes/macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36594489/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary inflammation as one of the extraintestinal manifestations of ulcerative colitis (UC) has attracted extensive attention, and its pathogenesis is closely related to gut dysbiosis. &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis&lt;/em&gt; subsp. lactis BL-99 (BL-99) can alleviate osteoporosis caused by UC, but less research has been done on other extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) caused by UC. This study aimed to explore the role and potential mechanisms of BL-99 on DSS-induced pulmonary complications in colitis mice. The results showed that BL-99 decreased weight loss, disease activity index score, colonic pathology score, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in colitis mice. BL-99 also alleviated DSS-induced lung pathological damage by suppressing the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory monocytes, and macrophages. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed lower abundances of several potentially pathogenic bacteria (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Burkholderia, Shigella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/em&gt;) and enrichment in specific beneficial bacteria (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Adlercreutzia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis&lt;/em&gt;) in colitis mice with BL-99 treatment. Targeted metabolomics suggested that BL-99 intervention promoted the production of intestinal acetate and butyrate. Finally, we observed that the pulmonary expression of primary acetate and butyrate receptors, including FFAR2, FFAR3, and, GPR109a, was up-regulated in BL-99-treated mice, which negatively correlated with inflammatory monocytes and macrophages. Altogether, these results suggest that BL-99 might be utilized as a probiotic intervention to prevent the incidence of colitis-related lung injury owing to its ability to shape the intestinal microbiota and suppress inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiome dysregulation drives bone damage in broiler tibial dyschondroplasia by disrupting glucose homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36596826/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) with multiple incentives is a metabolic skeletal disease that occurs in fast-growing broilers. Perturbations in the gut microbiota (GM) have been shown to affect bone homoeostasis, but the mechanisms by which GM modulates bone metabolism in TD broilers remain unknown. Here, using a broiler model of TD, we noted elevated blood glucose (GLU) levels in TD broilers, accompanied by alterations in the pancreatic structure and secretory function and damaged intestinal barrier function. Importantly, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of gut microbes from normal donors rehabilitated the GM and decreased the elevated GLU levels in TD broilers. A high GLU level is a predisposing factor to bone disease, suggesting that GM dysbiosis-mediated hyperglycaemia might be involved in bone regulation. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and short-chain fatty acid analysis revealed that the significantly increased level of the metabolite butyric acid derived from the genera &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Coprococcus&lt;/em&gt; regulated GLU levels in TD broilers by binding to GPR109A in the pancreas. Tibial studies showed reduced expression of vascular regulatory factors (including PI3K, AKT and VEFGA) based on transcriptomics analysis and reduced vascular distribution, contributing to nonvascularization of cartilage in the proximal tibial growth plate of TD broilers with elevated GLU levels. Additionally, treatment with the total flavonoids from Rhizoma drynariae further validated the improvement in bone homoeostasis in TD broilers by regulating GLU levels through the regulation of GM to subsequently improve intestinal and pancreatic function. These findings clarify the critical role of GM-mediated changes in GLU levels via the gut–pancreas axis in bone homoeostasis in TD chickens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intrahepatic osteopontin signaling by CREBZF defines a checkpoint for steatosis-to-NASH progression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36680394/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; NASH has emerged as a leading cause of chronic liver disease. However, the mechanisms that govern NASH fibrosis remain largely unknown. CREBZF is a CREB/ATF bZIP transcription factor that causes hepatic steatosis and metabolic defects in obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt; Here, we show that CREBZF is a key mechanism of liver fibrosis checkpoint that promotes hepatocyte injury and exacerbates diet-induced NASH in mice. CREBZF deficiency attenuated liver injury, fibrosis, and inflammation in diet-induced mouse models of NASH. CREBZF increases HSC activation and fibrosis in a hepatocyte-autonomous manner by stimulating an extracellular matrix protein osteopontin, a key regulator of fibrosis. The inhibition of miR-6964-3p mediates CREBZF-induced production and secretion of osteopontin in hepatocytes. Adeno-associated virus -mediated rescue of osteopontin restored HSC activation, liver fibrosis, and NASH progression in CREBZF-deficient mice. Importantly, expression levels of CREBZF are increased in livers of diet-induced NASH mouse models and humans with NASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Osteopontin signaling by CREBZF represents a previously unrecognized intrahepatic mechanism that triggers liver fibrosis and contributes to the severity of NASH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases of end-stage liver diseases, the proliferation of existing hepatocytes is compromised, a feature of human chronic liver disease, in which most hepatocytes are dysfunctional. So far, liver transplantation represents the only curative therapeutic solution for advanced liver diseases, and the shortage of donor organs leads to high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The promising treatment is to prompt the biliary epithelial cells (BECs) transdifferentiation. However, the critical factors governing the initiation of BEC-derived liver regeneration are largely unknown. The zebrafish has advantages in large-scale genetic screens to identify the critical factors involved in liver regeneration. Here, we combined N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea screen, positional cloning, transgenic lines, antibody staining, and in situ hybridization methods and identified a liver regeneration defect mutant (lrd) using the zebrafish extensive liver injury model. Through positional cloning and genomic sequencing, we mapped the mutation site to rngtt. Loss of rngtt lead to the defects of BEC dedifferentiation, bipotential progenitor cell activation, and cell proliferation in the initiation stage of liver regeneration. The transdifferentiation from BECs to hepatocytes did not occur even at the late stage of liver regeneration. Mechanically, Rngtt transcriptionally regulates the attachment of mRNA cap to mTORC1 components and dnmt1 to maintain the activation of mTORC1 and DNA methylation in BECs after severe liver injury and prompt BEC to hepatocyte conversion. Furthermore, rptor and dnmt1 mutants displayed the same liver regeneration defects as rngtt mutation. In conclusion, our results suggest Rngtt is a new factor that initiates BEC-derived liver regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcript shortening via alternative polyadenylation promotes gene expression during fracture healing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36596777/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maturation of the 3&amp;rsquo; end of almost all eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) requires cleavage and polyadenylation. Most mammalian mRNAs are polyadenylated at different sites within the last exon, generating alternative polyadenylation (APA) isoforms that have the same coding region but distinct 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated regions (UTRs). The 3&amp;rsquo;UTR contains motifs that regulate mRNA metabolism; thus, changing the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR length via APA can significantly affect gene expression. Endochondral ossification is a central process in bone healing, but the impact of APA on gene expression during this process is unknown. Here, we report the widespread occurrence of APA, which impacts multiple pathways that are known to participate in bone healing. Importantly, the progression of endochondral ossification involves global 3&amp;rsquo;UTR shortening, which is coupled with an increased abundance of shortened transcripts relative to other transcripts; these results highlight the role of APA in promoting gene expression during endochondral bone formation. Our mechanistic studies of transcripts that undergo APA in the fracture callus revealed an intricate regulatory network in which APA enhances the expression of the collagen, type I, alpha 1 (Col1a1) and Col1a2 genes, which encode the 2 subunits of the abundantly expressed protein collagen 1. APA exerts this effect by shortening the 3&amp;rsquo;UTRs of the Col1a1 and Col1a2 mRNAs, thus removing the binding sites of miR-29a-3p, which would otherwise strongly promote the degradation of both transcripts. Taken together, our study is the first to characterize the crucial roles of APA in regulating the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR landscape and modulating gene expression during fracture healing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Staphylococcal virulence factor HlgB targets the endoplasmic-reticulum-resident E3 ubiquitin ligase AMFR to promote pneumonia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36593296/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; invades cells and persists intracellularly, causing persistent inflammation that is notoriously difficult to treat. Here we investigated host-pathogen interactions underlying intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection in macrophages and discovered that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important cellular compartment for intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Using CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA library screening, we determined that the autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR), an ER-resident E3 ubiquitin ligase, played an essential role in mediating intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;-induced inflammation. AMFR directly interacted with TAK1-binding protein 3 (TAB3) in the ER, inducing K27-linked polyubiquitination of TAB3 on lysine 649 and promoting TAK1 activation. Moreover, the virulence factor γ-haemolysin B (HIgB) of &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; bound to the AMFR and regulated TAB3. Our findings highlight an unknown role of AMFR in intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection-induced pneumonia and suggest that pharmacological interruption of AMFR-mediated TAB3 signalling cascades and HIgB targeting may prevent invasive staphylococci-mediated pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TMBIM6 prevents VDAC1 multimerization and improves mitochondrial quality control to reduce sepsis-related myocardial injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36603706/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36603706/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulatory mechanisms involved in mitochondrial quality control (MQC) dysfunction during septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) remain incompletely characterized. Transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 6 (TMBIM6) is an endoplasmic reticulum protein with Ca2+ leak activity that modulates cellular responses to various cellular stressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we evaluated the role of TMBIM6 in SCM using cardiomyocyte-specific TMBIM6 knockout (TMBIM6CKO) and TMBIM6 transgenic (TMBIM6TG) mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myocardial TMBIM6 transcription and expression were significantly downregulated in wild-type mice upon LPS exposure, along with characteristic alterations in myocardial systolic/diastolic function, cardiac inflammation, and cardiomyocyte death. Notably, these alterations were further exacerbated in LPS-treated TMBIM6CKO mice, and largely absent in TMBIM6TG mice. In LPS-treated primary cardiomyocytes, TMBIM6 deficiency further impaired mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, while defective MQC was suggested by enhanced mitochondrial fission, impaired mitophagy, and disrupted mitochondrial biogenesis. Structural protein analysis, Co-IP, mutant TMBIM6 plasmid transfection, and molecular docking assays subsequently indicated that TMBIM6 exerts cardioprotection against LPS-induced sepsis by interacting with and preventing the oligomerization of voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), the major route of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that the TMBIM6-VDAC1 interaction prevents VDAC1 oligomerization and thus sustains mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis as well as MQC, contributing to improved myocardial function in SCM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular Vesicle-Encapsulated microRNAs as Novel Biomarkers of Lung Health</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35943330/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Early detection of respiratory diseases is critical to facilitate delivery of disease-modifying interventions. Extracellular vesicle-enriched microRNAs (EV-miRNAs) may represent reliable markers of early lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; Evaluate associations of plasma EV-miRNAs with lung function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The prospective NAS (Normative Aging Study) collected plasma EV-miRNA measurements from 1996-2015 and spirometry every 3-5 years through 2019. Associations of EV-miRNAs with baseline lung function were modeled using linear regression. To complement the individual miRNA approach, unsupervised machine learning was used to identify clusters of participants with distinct EV-miRNA profiles. Associations of EV-miRNA profiles with multivariate latent longitudinal lung function trajectories were modeled using log binomial regression. Biological functions of significant EV-miRNAs were explored using pathway analyses. Results were replicated in an independent sample of NAS participants and in the HEALS (Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/em&gt; In the main cohort of 656 participants, 51 plasma EV-miRNAs were associated with baseline lung function (false discovery rate-adjusted &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.05), 28 of which were replicated in the independent NAS sample and/or in the HEALS cohort. A subset of participants with distinct EV-miRNA expression patterns had increased risk of declining lung function over time, which was replicated in the independent NAS sample. Significant EV-miRNAs were shown in pathway analyses to target biological pathways that regulate respiratory cellular immunity, the lung inflammatory response, and airway structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Plasma EV-miRNAs may represent a robust biomarker of subclinical lung injury and may facilitate early identification and treatment of patients at risk of developing overt lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Delay Diabetic Wound Healing by Inducing Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition via the Hippo pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36594092/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are among the most frequent complications of diabetes with significant morbidity and mortality. Diabetes can trigger neutrophils to undergo histone citrullination by protein arginine deiminase 4 (encoded by Padi4 in mice) and release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The specific mechanism of NETs-mediated wound healing impairment in diabetes remains unknown. In this study, we show neutrophils are more susceptible to NETosis in diabetic wound environments. Via in vitro experiments and in vivo models of wound healing using wide-type and Padi4 -/- mice, we demonstrate NETs can induce the activation of PAK2 via the membrane receptor TLR-9. Then PAK2 phosphorylates the intracellular protein Merlin/NF2 to inhibit the Hippo-YAP pathway. YAP binds to transcription factor SMAD2 and translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to promote endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which ultimately impedes angiogenesis and delays wound healing. Suppression of the Merlin/YAP/SMAD2 pathway can attenuate NET-induced EndMT. Inhibition of NETosis accelerates wound healing by reducing EndMT and promoting angiogenesis. Cumulatively, these data suggest NETosis delays diabetic wound healing by inducing EndMT via the Hippo-YAP pathway. Increased understanding of the molecular mechanism that regulates NETosis and EndMT will be of considerable value for providing cellular targets amenable to therapeutic intervention for DFUs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>De Novo Design of Activatable Photoacoustic/Fluorescent Probes for Imaging Acute Lung Injury In Vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36584357/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective monitoring of the physiological progression of acute lung injury (ALI) in real time is crucial for early theranostics to reduce its high mortality. In particular, activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic molecule probes have attracted attention to assess ALI by detecting related indicators. However, the existing fluorophores often encounter issues of low retention in the lungs and slow clearance from the body, which compromise the probe&amp;rsquo;s actual capability for in situ imaging by intravenous injection in vivo. Herein, a novel near-infrared hemicyanines fluorophore (FJH) bearing a quaternary ammonium group was first developed by combining with the rational design and screening strategy. The properties of good hydrophilicity and blood circulation effectively enable FJH accumulation for lung imaging. Inspired by the high retention efficiency, the probe FJH-C that turns on fluorescence and photoacoustic signals in response to the ALI indicator (esterase) was subsequently synthesized. Notably, the probe FJH-C successfully achieved the selectivity and sensitivity toward esterase in vitro and in living cells. More importantly, FJH-C can be further used to assess lipopolysaccharides and silica-induced ALI through the desired fluo-photoacoustic signal. Therefore, this study not only shows the first activatable probe for real-time imaging of lung function but also highlights the fluorophore structure with high lung retention. It is believed that FJH and FJH-C can serve as an efficient platform to reveal the pathological progression of other lung diseases for early diagnosis and medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Derinat® has an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect on the model of acute lung injury in male SD rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36642990/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simulate acute lung injury (ALI) in SD male rats they we administered intratracheally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by hyperventilation of the lungs (HVL), which lead to functional changes in the respiratory system and an increase in the blood serum concentration of inflammatory cytokines. LPS + HVL after 4 h lead to pronounced histological signs of lung damage. We have studied the effectiveness of Derinat® when administered intramuscularly at dose of 7.5 mg/kg for 8 days in the ALI model. Derinat® administration lead to an increase in the concentration of most of the studied cytokines in a day. In the ALI model the administration of Derinat® returned the concentration of cytokines to its original values already 48 h after LPS + HVL, and also normalized the parameters of pulmonary respiration in comparison with animals without treatment. By the eighth day after LPS + HVL, respiratory parameters and cytokine levels, as well as biochemical and hematological parameters did not differ between groups, while histological signs of residual effects of lung damage were found in all animals, and were more pronounced in Derinat® group, which may indicate stimulation of the local immune response. Thus, the administration of Derinat® stimulates the immune response, has a pronounced protective effect against cytokinemia and respiratory failure caused by ALI, has immunomodulatory effect, and also stimulates a local immune response in lung tissues. Thus, Derinat® is a promising treatment for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interdependent Nuclear Co-Trafficking of ASPP1 and p53 Aggravates Cardiac Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36656967/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36656967/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OBJECTIVE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASPP1 (apoptosis stimulating of p53 protein 1) is critical in regulating cell apoptosis as a cofactor of p53 to promote its transcriptional activity in the nucleus. However, whether cytoplasmic ASPP1 affects p53 nuclear trafficking and its role in cardiac diseases remains unknown. This study aims to explore the mechanism by which ASPP1 modulates p53 nuclear trafficking and the subsequent contribution to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;METHODS AND RESULTS:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immunofluorescent staining showed that under normal condition ASPP1 and p53 colocalized in the cytoplasm of neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes, while they were both upregulated and translocated to the nuclei upon hypoxia/reoxygenation treatment. The nuclear translocation of ASPP1 and p53 was interdependent, as knockdown of either ASPP1 or p53 attenuated nuclear translocation of the other one. Inhibition of importin-β1 resulted in the cytoplasmic sequestration of both p53 and ASPP1 in neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes with hypoxia/reoxygenation stimulation. Overexpression of ASPP1 potentiated, whereas knockdown of ASPP1 inhibited the expression of Bax (Bcl2-associated X), PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis), and Noxa, direct apoptosis-associated targets of p53. ASPP1 was also increased in the I/R myocardium. Cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic overexpression of ASPP1 aggravated I/R injury as indicated by increased infarct size and impaired cardiac function. Conversely, knockout of ASPP1 mitigated cardiac I/R injury. The same qualitative data were observed in neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. Furthermore, inhibition of p53 significantly blunted the proapoptotic activity and detrimental effects of ASPP1 both in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONCLUSIONS:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binding of ASPP1 to p53 triggers their nuclear cotranslocation via importin-β1 that eventually exacerbates cardiac I/R injury. The findings imply that interfering the expression of ASPP1 or the interaction between ASPP1 and p53 to block their nuclear trafficking represents an important therapeutic strategy for cardiac I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lycopene Attenuates Di(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate-Induced Mitochondrial Damage and Inflammation in Kidney via cGAS-STING Signaling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a highly harmful and persistent environmental pollutant. Due to its unique chemical composition, it frequently dissolves and enters the environment to endanger human and animal health. Lycopene is a natural bioactive component that can potentially reduce the risk of environmental factor-induced chronic diseases. The present study sought to explore the role and underlying mechanism of lycopene (LYC) on DEHP-induced renal inflammatory response and apoptosis. In this study, mice were orally treated with LYC (5 mg/kg BW/day) and/or DEHP (500 or 1000 mg/kg BW/day) for 28 days. Our results indicated that LYC prevented DEHP-induced histopathological alterations and ultrastructural injuries, including decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), PINK1/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy, and mitochondrial energetic deficit. When damaged mitochondria release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into cytosol, LYC can alleviate inflammation and apoptosis caused by DEHP exposure by activating the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS-STING) signal pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrate that LYC can reduce mitophagy caused by DEHP exposure by activating the PINK1/Parkin pathway and then reduce renal inflammation and apoptosis through the cGAS-STING pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oleocanthal alleviated lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in chickens by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway activation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of oleocanthal (OC) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in chickens and its possible mechanisms. In total, 20 chickens were randomly divided into 4 groups: control (CON) group, LPS group, LPS + OC group, and OC group. LPS + OC and OC groups were intragastrically administered a 5 mg/kg·d OC dose for 7 d. On d 8, the LPS group and LPS + OC group were intratracheally administered 2 mg/kg LPS for 12 h. It was found that OC ameliorated the pathological morphology and significantly suppressed apoptosis after OC treatment in LPS-induced ALI chicken (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Antioxidant capacity was higher in the LPS + OC group compared with the LPS group (P &amp;lt; 0.01). OC downregulated the related genes and proteins expression of toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-κB (TLR4/NF-κB) pathway in LPS group (P &amp;lt; 0.01). In conclusion, OC supplementation can alleviate LPS-induced ALI in chickens by suppressing apoptosis, enhancing lung antioxidant capacities and inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway activation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. alleviate LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. protect mice by reducing pulmonary edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. inhibit the influx of inflammatory cells into the lung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. reduce inflammation in the lung by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common respiratory disease in clinics, which is characterized by alveolar-capillary membrane loss, plasma protein leakage, pulmonary edema, massive neutrophil infiltration, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators. Rhodiola rosea L. an adaptogenic plant rich in phenylethanoloids, phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. We hope to verify the relieving effect of total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. (RTG) on ALI in mice and clarify its mechanism through this study. In this study, we identified the effect and mechanism of RTG on ALI through LPS-induced ALI mice. After RTG treatment, the pathological structure of lung tissue in ALI mice induced by LPS was significantly improved, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells was reduced. In addition, RTG reduced the production of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the serum of ALI mice and reduced the content or activity of MPO, T-SOD, GSH, and MDA in lung tissue. RNAseq analysis showed that RTG ameliorated LPS-induced ALI through anti-inflammatory, reduced immune response, and anti-apoptotic activities. The western blotting analysis confirmed that RTG could down-regulate the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB p65, and p-IκBα/IκBα. These results suggest that RTG can attenuate LPS-induced ALI through antioxidants and inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Combined scRNA and TCR sequencing of human brain tissues with injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infiltrated CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells participate in radiation-induced and ischemic brain injuries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disease-associated microglial cluster featured with CCL2 and CCL8 expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microglia-derived CCL2/CCL8 mediate brain infiltration of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crosstalk between the nervous and immune systems has gained increasing attention for its emerging role in neurological diseases. Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) remains the most common medical complication of cranial radiotherapy, and its pathological mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Here, using single-cell RNA and T cell receptor sequencing, we found infiltration and clonal expansion of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T lymphocytes in the lesioned brain tissues of RIBI patients. Furthermore, by strategies of genetic or pharmacologic interruption, we identified a chemotactic action of microglia-derived CCL2/CCL8 chemokines in mediating the infiltration of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CCR5&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and tissue damage in RIBI mice. Such a chemotactic axis also participated in the progression of cerebral infarction in the mouse model of ischemic injury. Our findings therefore highlight the critical role of microglia in mediating the dysregulation of adaptive immune responses and reveal a potential therapeutic strategy for non-infectious brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The transcription factor ATF4 mediates endoplasmic reticulum stress related podocyte injury and slit diaphragm defects</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36587794/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in &lt;em&gt;OSGEP&lt;/em&gt; and four other genes that encode subunits of the KEOPS complex cause Galloway-Mowat syndrome, a severe, inherited kidney-neurological disease. The complex catalyzes an essential posttranscriptional modification of tRNA and its loss of function induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster garland nephrocytes and cultured human podocytes, we aimed to elucidate the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of KEOPS related glomerular disease and to test pharmacological inhibition of ER stress related signaling as a therapeutic principle. We found that ATF4, an ER stress mediating transcription factor, or its fly orthologue Crc, were upregulated in both fly nephrocytes and human podocytes. Knockdown of Tcs3, a fly orthologue of OSGEP, caused slit diaphragm defects, recapitulating the human kidney phenotype. &lt;em&gt;OSGEP&lt;/em&gt; cDNA with mutations found in patients lacked the capacity for rescue. Genetic interaction studies in Tcs3 deficient nephrocytes revealed that Crc mediates not only cell injury, but surprisingly also slit diaphragm defects, and that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Crc activation attenuates both phenotypes. These findings are conserved in human podocytes where ATF4 inhibition improved the viability of podocytes with OSGEP knockdown, with chemically-induced ER stress, and where ATF4 target genes and pro-apoptotic gene clusters are upregulated upon OSGEP knockdown. Thus, our data identify ATF4 mediated signaling as a molecular link between ER stress, slit diaphragm defects, podocyte injury, and suggest that modulation of ATF4 signaling may be a potential therapeutic target for certain podocyte diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD-L1 upregulation promotes drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting vimentin degradation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36586643/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with high mortality and limited therapeutic options. The immune checkpoint PD1/PD-L1 axis is related to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, and upregulated expression levels of PD-L1 have been demonstrated in IPF patients. However, the mechanism of PD-L1 in pulmonary fibrosis is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated upregulated expression of PD-L1 in fibrotic lung tissues and sera of IPF patients. Bleomycin (BLM) treatment induced PD-L1 upregulation, EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition) and fibrosis-like morphology changes in human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiCs). Silencing PD-L1 attenuated BLM-induced EMT and fibrosis-like morphology changes in HPAEpiCs. In addition, we identified that PD-L1 directly binds to vimentin and inhibits vimentin ubiquitination, thereby increasing vimentin levels in HPAEpiCs. Silencing of vimentin inhibited BLM- and PD-L1-induced fibrosis in HPAEpiCs. The correlation between PD-L1 and EMT or vimentin expression was further confirmed in clinical samples and animal models. Finally, we used BLM- and paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis animal models to confirm the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects of PD-L1 silencing. Taken together, our findings suggest that upregulated PD-L1 stimulates EMT of alveolar epithelial cells by increasing vimentin levels by inhibiting vimentin ubiquitination, thereby contributing to pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self-Assembly of Antimicrobial Peptide-Based Micelles Breaks the Limitation of Trypsin</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36577517/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting the limitation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) application in vivo, self-assembled AMPs library with specific nanostructures is expected to gradually overtake monomer AMPs libraries in the future. Peptide polymers are fascinating self-assembling nanoscale structures that have great advantage in biomedical applications because of their satisfactory biocompatibility and versatile properties. Herein, we describe a strategy for inducing the self-assembly of T9W into nanostructured antimicrobial micelles with evidently improved pharmacological properties, that is, PEGylation at the C-terminal of T9W (CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt;), an antibacterial biomaterial that self-assembles in aqueous media without exogenous excipients, has been developed. Compared with parental molecular, the CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; is more effective against &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, and its antibacterial spectrum had also been broadened. Additionally, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles had higher stability under salt ion, serum, and acid-base environments. Importantly, the self-assembled structure is highly resistant to trypsin degradation, probably allowing T9W to be applied in clinical settings in the future. Mechanistically, by acting on membranes and through supplementary bactericidal mechanisms, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles contribute to the antibacterial process. Collectively, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles exhibited good biocompatibility &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, resulting in highly effective treatment in a mouse acute lung injury model induced by &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 without drug resistance. These advances may profoundly accelerate the clinical transformation of T9W and promote the development of a combination of peptide-based antibiotics and PEGylated nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcium overload is one of the early determinants of the core cellular events that contribute to the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI), which include oxidative stress, ATP depletion, calcium overload, and inflammatory response with self-amplifying and interactive feedback loops that ultimately lead to cellular injury and renal failure. Excluding adjuvant therapy, there are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AKI. Using an adipic dihydride linker, we modified the hyaluronic acid polymer chain with a potent antioxidant, bilirubin, to produce an amphiphilic conjugate. Subsequently, we developed a kidney-targeted and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive drug delivery system based on the flash nanocomplexation method to deliver a well-known intracellular calcium chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N&amp;rsquo;,N&amp;rsquo;-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM, BA), with the goal of rescuing renal cell damage via rapidly scavenging of intracellularly overloaded Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced AKI rat model, a single dose of as-prepared formulation (BA 100 μg·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) 6 h post-reperfusion significantly reduced renal function indicators by more than 60% within 12 h, significantly alleviated tissular pathological changes, ameliorated tissular oxidative damage, significantly inhibited apoptosis of renal tubular cells and the expression of renal tubular marker kidney injury molecule 1, etc., thus greatly reducing the risk of kidney failure. Mechanistically, the treatment with BA-loaded NPs significantly inhibited the activation of the ER stress cascade response (IRE1-TRAF2-JNK, ATF4-CHOP, and ATF6 axis) and regulated the downstream apoptosis-related pathway while also reducing the inflammatory response. The BA-loaded NPs hold great promise as a potential therapy for I/R injury-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung injury is induced by abrupt increase in respiratory rate but prevented by recruitment maneuver in mild acute respiratory distress syndrome in rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36571572/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Gradually changing respiratory rate (RR) over time to reduce ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) has not been investigated. We hypothesized that gradual, compared to abrupt, increments in RR would mitigate VILI and that recruitment maneuver (RM) prior to abrupt increasing RR may prevent injurious biological impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Twenty-four hours after intratracheal administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, 49 male Wistar rats were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated (VT=6ml/kg, PEEP=3cmH2O) with RR increase patterns as follows (n=7/group): (1)control-1, RR=70bpm for 2h; (2) and (3)abrupt increases of RR for 1h and 2h, respectively, both for 2h; (4)shorter RR adaptation, gradually increasing RR (from 70 to 130bpm over 30min); (5)longer RR adaptation, more gradual increase in RR (from 70 to 130bpm over 60min), both for 2h; (6)control-2, abrupt increase of RR maintained for 1h; and (7)control-3, RM [CPAP=30cmH2O for 30s] followed by control-2 protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; At the end of 1h of mechanical ventilation, cumulative diffuse alveolar damage scores were lower in shorter (11.0 [8.0-12.0]) and longer (13.0 [11.0-14.0]) RR adaptation groups than in animals with abrupt increase of RR for 1 h (25.0 [22.0-26.0] p=0.035, and p=0.048, respectively) and 2 h (35.0 [32.0-39.0], p=0.003, and p=0.040, respectively); mechanical power and lung heterogeneity were lower, and alveolar integrity was higher, in the longer RR adaptation group compared with abruptly adjusted groups; markers of lung inflammation (IL-6), epithelial (CC-16) and endothelial cell damage (VCAM-1) were higher in both abrupt groups, but not in either RR adaptation group, compared with controls. RM prevented the increase in VCAM-1 and CC-16 gene expressions in the abruptly increased RR groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In mild experimental ARDS in rats, gradually increasing RR, compared with abruptly doing so, can mitigate the development of VILI. In addition, recruitment maneuver prevented the injurious biological impact of abrupt increases in RR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 15-30% of patients are likely to develop COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are still few effective and well-understood therapies available. Novel variants and short-lasting immunity are posing challenges to vaccine efficacy, so finding antiviral and antiinflammatory treatments remains crucial. Here, tripterin (TP), a traditional Chinese medicine, was encapsulated into liposome (TP lipo) to investigate its antiviral and antiinflammatory effects in severe COVID-19. By using two severe COVID-19 models in human ACE2-transgenic (hACE2) mice, an analysis of TP lipo&amp;rsquo;s effects on pulmonary immune responses was conducted. Pulmonary pathological alterations and viral burden were reduced by TP lipo treatment. TP lipo inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication and hyperinflammation in infected cells and mice, two crucial events in severe COVID-19 pathophysiology, it is a promising drug candidate to treat SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UHRF1-mediated ferroptosis promotes pulmonary fibrosis via epigenetic repression of GPX4 and FSP1 genes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis (PF), as an end-stage clinical phenotype of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), is frequently initiated after alveolar injury, in which ferroptosis has been identified as a critical event aggravating the pathophysiological progression of this disease. Here in, a comprehensive analysis of two mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis developed in our lab demonstrated that lung damage-induced ferroptosis of alveolar epithelial Type2 cells (AEC2) significantly accumulates during the development of pulmonary fibrosis while ferroptosis suppressor genes GPX4 and FSP1 are dramatically inactivated. Mechanistically, upregulation of de novo methylation regulator Uhrf1 sensitively elevates CpG site methylation levels in promoters of both GPX4 and FSP1 genes and induces the epigenetic repression of both genes, subsequently leading to ferroptosis in chemically interfered AEC2 cells. Meanwhile, specific inhibition of UHRF1 highly arrests the ferroptosis formation and blocks the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in both of our research models. This study first, to our knowledge, identified the involvement of Uhrf1 in mediating the ferroptosis of chemically injured AEC2s via de novo promoter-specific methylation of both GPX4 and FSP1 genes, which consequently accelerates the process of pulmonary fibrosis. The above findings also strongly suggested Uhrf1 as a novel potential target in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Peptide Vaccine Against ADAMTS-7 Ameliorates Atherosclerosis and Postinjury Neointima Hyperplasia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36562301/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36562301/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The metalloprotease ADAMTS-7 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 7) is a novel locus associated with human coronary atherosclerosis. ADAMTS-7 deletion protects against atherosclerosis and vascular restenosis in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We designed 3 potential vaccines consisting of distinct B cell epitopic peptides derived from ADAMTS-7 and conjugated with the carrier protein KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) as well as aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. Arterial ligation or wire injury was used to induce neointima in mice, whereas &lt;em&gt;ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LDLR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (low-density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR) mice fed a high-fat diet were applied to assess atherosclerosis. In addition, coronary stent implantation was performed on vaccine-immunized Bama miniature pigs, followed by optical coherence tomography to evaluate coronary intimal hyperplasia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A vaccine, ATS7vac, was screened out from 3 candidates to effectively inhibit intimal thickening in murine carotid artery ligation models after vaccination. As well, immunization with ATS7vac alleviated neointima formation in murine wire injury models and mitigated atherosclerotic lesions in both hyperlipidemic &lt;em&gt;ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LDLR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice without lowering lipid levels. Preclinically, ATS7vac markedly impeded intimal hyperplasia in swine stented coronary arteries, but without significant immune-related organ injuries. Mechanistically, ATS7vac vaccination produced specific antibodies against ADAMTS-7, which markedly repressed ADAMTS-7-mediated COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein) and TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) degradation and subsequently inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell migration but promoted re-endothelialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; ATS7vac is a novel atherosclerosis vaccine that also alleviates in-stent restenosis. The application of ATS7vac would be a complementary therapeutic avenue to the current lipid-lowering strategy for atherosclerotic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chimeric efferocytic receptors improve apoptotic cell clearance and alleviate inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36563662/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36563662/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design of chimeric receptors for efferocytosis (CHEF) to enhance efferocytosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boosting efferocytosis via CHEF attenuates multiple inflammatory insults &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protein folding and misfolded protein degradation are rate-limiting steps in efferocytosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHEF expression can improve outcomes in ongoing disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies turn over billions of cells daily via apoptosis and are in turn cleared by phagocytes via the process of &amp;ldquo;efferocytosis.&amp;rdquo; Defects in efferocytosis are now linked to various inflammatory diseases. Here, we designed a strategy to boost efferocytosis, denoted &amp;ldquo;chimeric receptor for efferocytosis&amp;rdquo; (CHEF). We fused a specific signaling domain within the cytoplasmic adapter protein ELMO1 to the extracellular phosphatidylserine recognition domains of the efferocytic receptors BAI1 or TIM4, generating BELMO and TELMO, respectively. CHEF-expressing phagocytes display a striking increase in efferocytosis. In mouse models of inflammation, BELMO expression attenuates colitis, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. In mechanistic studies, BELMO increases ER-resident enzymes and chaperones to overcome protein-folding-associated toxicity, which was further validated in a model of ER-stress-induced renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Finally, TELMO introduction after onset of kidney injury significantly reduced fibrosis. Collectively, these data advance a concept of chimeric efferocytic receptors to boost efferocytosis and dampen inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiota modulates lung fibrosis severity following acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36543914/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent studies demonstrate the significance of gut microbiota on the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases; yet little is known regarding the role of the gut microbiota in lung fibrosis progression. Here we show, using the bleomycin murine model to quantify lung fibrosis in C57BL/6 J mice housed in germ-free, animal biosafety level 1 (ABSL-1), or animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL-2) environments, that germ-free mice are protected from lung fibrosis, while ABSL-1 and ABSL-2 mice develop mild and severe lung fibrosis, respectively. Metagenomic analysis reveals no notable distinctions between ABSL-1 and ABSL-2 lung microbiota, whereas greater microbial diversity, with increased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacilli, is present in ABSL-1 compared to ABSL-2 gut microbiota. Flow cytometric analysis reveals enhanced IL-6/STAT3/IL-17A signaling in pulmonary CD4 + T cells of ABSL-2 mice. Fecal transplantation of ABSL-2 stool into germ-free mice recapitulated more severe fibrosis than transplantation of ABSL-1 stool. Lactobacilli supernatant reduces collagen 1 A production in IL-17A- and TGFβ1-stimulated human lung fibroblasts. These findings support a functional role of the gut microbiota in augmenting lung fibrosis severity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PLD2 deletion alleviates disruption of tight junctions in sepsis-induced ALI by regulating PA/STAT3 phosphorylation pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36700766/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/36700766/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PLD2 inhibition attenuated PA-induced STAT3 phosphorylation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STAT3 signaling pathway negatively regulated the expression levels of claudin5, occludin and ZO-1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking PLD2 can improve ARDS, and PLD2 may be a therapeutic target in ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Increased inflammatory exudation caused by endothelium and endothelial junction damage is a typical pathological feature of acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury (ARDS/ALI). Previous studies have shown that phospholipase D2 (PLD2) can increase the inflammatory response and has a close relationship with the severity of sepsis-induced ALI and the mortality of sepsis, but its mechanism is unknown. This study explored the effect and mechanism of PLD2 deletion on the structure and function of endothelial tight junction (TJ) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used C57BL/6 mice (wild-type and PLD2 knockout (PLD2-/-)) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) models of sepsis-ALI. The pathological changes were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Pulmonary vascular permeability was detected using wet-dry ratio, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran, FITC-albumin, and immunoglobulin M concentration of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. FITC-dextran and &lt;em&gt;trans&lt;/em&gt;-endothelial electrical resistance assay were used to evaluate endothelial permeability on LPS-stimulated HUVECs. The mRNA expressions of TJ proteins were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Then, protein levels were detected through Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. The content of phosphatidic acid (PA), a downstream product of PLD2, was detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; PLD2 deficiency not only alleviated lung histopathological changes and improved pulmonary vascular permeability but also increased the survival rate of ALI mice. Knockout of PLD2 or treatment with the PLD2 inhibitor can reduce the damage of endothelial TJ proteins, namely, claudin5, occludin and zonula occludens protein-1, in sepsis-ALI mice and LPS-stimulated HUVECs. The level of the PLD2 catalytic product PA increased in LPS-stimulated HUVECs, and exogenous PA can reduce the TJ protein expression and increase signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in vitro. Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation attenuated PA-induced degradation of endothelial TJs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; PLD2 knockout or inhibition may protect against LPS-induced lung injury by regulating the PA/STAT3 phosphorylation/endothelial TJ axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inheritance of paternal DNA damage by histone-mediated repair restriction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36544019/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How paternal exposure to ionizing radiation affects genetic inheritance and disease risk in the offspring has been a long-standing question in radiation biology. In humans, nearly 80% of transmitted mutations arise in the paternal germline1, but the transgenerational effects of ionizing radiation exposure has remained controversial and the mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that in sex-separated Caenorhabditis elegans strains, paternal, but not maternal, exposure to ionizing radiation leads to transgenerational embryonic lethality. The offspring of irradiated males displayed various genome instability phenotypes, including DNA fragmentation, chromosomal rearrangement and aneuploidy. Paternal DNA double strand breaks were repaired by maternally provided error-prone polymerase theta-mediated end joining. Mechanistically, we show that depletion of an orthologue of human histone H1.0, HIS-24, or the heterochromatin protein HPL-1, could significantly reverse the transgenerational embryonic lethality. Removal of HIS-24 or HPL-1 reduced histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation and enabled error-free homologous recombination repair in the germline of the F1 generation from ionizing radiation-treated P0 males, consequently improving the viability of the F2 generation. This work establishes the mechanistic underpinnings of the heritable consequences of paternal radiation exposure on the health of offspring, which may lead to congenital disorders and cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resolution of post-lung transplant ischemia-reperfusion injury is modulated via Resolvin D1-FPR2 and Maresin 1-LGR6 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36628837/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Dysregulation of inflammation-resolution pathways leads to postlung transplant (LTx) ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and allograft dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that combined treatment with specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, that is, Resolvin D1 (RvD1) and Maresin-1 (MaR1), enhances inflammation-resolution of lung IR injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Expression of RvD1 and MaR1 was analyzed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients on days 0, 1, and 7 post-LTx. Lung IR injury was evaluated in C57BL/6 (WT), FPR2-/-, and LGR6 siRNA treated mice using a hilar-ligation model with or without administration with RvD1 and/or MaR1. A donation after circulatory death and murine orthotopic lung transplantation model was used to evaluate the protection by RvD1 and MaR1 against lung IR injury. In vitro studies analyzed alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cell activation after treatment with RvD1 or MaR1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; RvD1 and MaR1 expressions in BAL from post-LTx patients was significantly increased on day 7 compared to days 0 and 1. Concomitant RvD1 and MaR1 treatment significantly mitigated early pulmonary inflammation and lung IR injury in WT mice, which was regulated via FPR2 and LGR6 receptors. In the murine orthotopic donation after cardiac death LTx model, RvD1 and MaR1 treatments significantly attenuated lung IR injury and increased PaO2 levels compared to saline-treated controls. Mechanistically, RvD1/FPR2 signaling on alveolar macrophages attenuated HMGB1 and TNF-α secretion and upregulated uptake of macrophage-dependent apoptotic neutrophils (efferocytosis), whereas MaR1/LGR6 signaling mitigated CXCL1 secretion by epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Bioactive proresolving lipid mediator-dependent signaling that is, RvD1/FPR2 and MaR1/LGR6- offers a novel therapeutic strategy in post-LTx injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The transcription factor Fosl1 preserves Klotho expression and protects from acute kidney injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased expression of AP-1 transcription factor components has been reported in acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the role of specific components, such as Fosl1, in tubular cells or AKI is unknown. Upstream regulator analysis of murine nephrotoxic AKI transcriptomics identified AP-1 as highly upregulated. Among AP-1 canonical components, Fosl1 was found to be upregulated in two transcriptomics datasets from nephrotoxic murine AKI induced by folic acid or cisplatin and from proximal tubular cells exposed to TWEAK, a cytokine mediator of AKI. Fosl1 was minimally expressed in the kidneys of control uninjured mice. Increased Fosl1 protein was localized to proximal tubular cell nuclei in AKI. In human AKI, FOSL1 was found present in proximal tubular cells in kidney sections and in urine along with increased urinary FOSL1 mRNA. Selective Fosl1 deficiency in proximal tubular cells (Fosl1Δtub) increased the severity of murine cisplatin- or folate-induced AKI as characterized by lower kidney function, more severe kidney inflammation and Klotho downregulation. Indeed, elevated AP-1 activity was observed after cisplatin-induced AKI in Fosl1Δtub mice compared to wild type mice. More severe Klotho downregulation preceded more severe kidney dysfunction. The Klotho promoter was enriched in Fosl1 binding sites and Fosl1 bound to the Klotho promoter in cisplatin-AKI. In cultured proximal tubular cells, Fosl1 targeting increased the proinflammatory response and downregulated Klotho. In vivo, recombinant Klotho administration protected Fosl1Δtub mice from cisplatin-AKI. Thus, increased proximal tubular Fosl1 expression during AKI is an adaptive response, preserves Klotho. and limits the severity of tubular cell injury and AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its inflammatory form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), have quickly risen to become the most prevalent chronic liver disease in the Western world and are risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is not only one of the most common cancers but is also highly lethal. Nevertheless, there are currently no clinically approved drugs for NAFLD, and NASH-induced HCC poses a unique metabolic microenvironment that may influence responsiveness to certain treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the pathogenesis of this rampant disease to devise new therapies. In this line, preclinical mouse models are crucial tools to investigate mechanisms as well as novel treatment modalities during the pathogenesis of NASH and subsequent HCC in preparation for human clinical trials. Although, there are numerous genetically induced, diet-induced and toxin-induced models of NASH, not all of these models faithfully phenocopy and mirror the human pathology very well. In this Perspective, we shed some light onto the most widely used mouse models of NASH and highlight some of the key advantages and disadvantages of the various models with an emphasis on &amp;lsquo;Western diets&amp;rsquo;, which are increasingly recognized as some of the best models in recapitulating the human NASH pathology and comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BAP31 regulates the expression of ICAM-1/VCAM-1 via MyD88/NF-κB pathway in acute lung injury mice model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549351/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; The cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that mediate neutrophil-endothelium cell adhesion are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). B-cell receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31) has been reported to engage in the expression of some CAMs. This study was undertaken to explore whether BAP31 in endotheliocyte affects the pathological process of ALI by regulating CAMs, and its possible mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; Our study used the shBAP31 endothelium cell lines and endothelial-specific BAP31 conditional knockdown mice constructed via Cre/loxP system. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the histopathological manifestations. The adhesion of neutrophils to vascular wall was examined by intravital microscopy. The nuclear translocation of NF-κB was observed by immunofluorescence staining assay. Flow cytometric, real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assay were performed to determine the expression of CAMs and key proteins in MyD88/NF-κB-related signaling pathway. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were analyzed for transcriptional activity of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; Mechanistic investigations indicated that endothelium-specific BAP31 depletion dramatically reduced the capacity of neutrophils adherence to endothelial cells (ECs), which was mainly attributed to the significant downregulation of ICAM-1 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and VCAM-1 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) expression. Interestingly, BAP31 knockdown apparently deactivated MyD88/TRAF6-mediated TAK1/NF-κB and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades, resulting in the inhibition of NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; Our data furnished convincing evidence that BAP31 deficiency performs a mitigative effect on ALI by decreasing neutrophils-ECs adhesion. These findings identified BAP31 as a promising protein for regulating the pathogenesis process of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging roles of mechanosensitive ion channels in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36539808/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a devastating respiratory disorder with high rates of mortality and morbidity, but the detailed underlying mechanisms of ALI/ARDS remain largely unknown. Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), including epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Piezo channels, transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), and two-pore domain potassium ion (K2P) channels, are highly expressed in lung tissues, and the activity of these MSCs can be modulated by mechanical forces (e.g., mechanical ventilation) and other stimuli (e.g., LPS, hyperoxia). Dysfunction of MSCs has been found in various types of ALI/ARDS, and MSCs play a key role in regulating alveolar fluid clearance, alveolar epithelial/endothelial barrier function, the inflammatory response and surfactant secretion in ALI/ARDS lungs. Targeting MSCs exerts therapeutic effects in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. In this review, we summarize the structure and functions of several well-recognized MSCs, the role of MSCs in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and recent advances in the pharmacological and molecular modulation of MSCs in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. According to the current literature, targeting MSCs might be a very promising therapeutic approach against ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kir4.2 mediates proximal potassium effects on glutaminase activity and kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36543132/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; deficiency causes kidney-specific injury and inflammation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Injury effects are dependent on the proximal K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Kir4.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kir4.2 mediates activation of the ammoniagenesis pathway under low-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kidney deletion of glutaminase prevents low-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated kidney injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inadequate potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) consumption correlates with increased mortality and poor cardiovascular outcomes. Potassium effects on blood pressure have been described previously; however, whether or not low K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; independently affects kidney disease progression remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that dietary K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; deficiency causes direct kidney injury. Effects depend on reduced blood K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and are kidney specific. In response to reduced K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the channel Kir4.2 mediates altered proximal tubule (PT) basolateral K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux, causing intracellular acidosis and activation of the enzyme glutaminase and the ammoniagenesis pathway. Deletion of either Kir4.2 or glutaminase protects from low-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; injury. Reduced K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;also mediates injury and fibrosis in a model of aldosteronism. These results demonstrate that the PT epithelium, like the distal nephron, is K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sensitive, with reduced blood K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; causing direct PT injury. Kir4.2 and glutaminase are essential mediators of this injury process, and we identify their potential for future targeting in the treatment of chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PI3K/AKT-mediated autophagy inhibition facilitates mast cell activation to enhance severe inflammatory lung injury in influenza A virus- and secondary Staphylococcus aureus-infected mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549394/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality each year globally, and secondary bacterial infection further exacerbates the severity and fatality of the initial viral infection. Mast cells have substantial roles in protecting the respiratory tract mucosa, while their role in viral and bacterial co-infection remains unclear. The present study revealed that secondary Staphylococcus aureus infection significantly aggravated the activation of mast cells during the initial H1N1 infection both in vivo and in vitro, which was closely related to the increased inflammatory lung injury and mortality. Meanwhile, the secondary S. aureus infection suppressed autophagy and promoted inflammatory mediators released by mast cells through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Blocking PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation, could rescue autophagy and inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, based on the influenza A viral and secondary bacterial infected mice model, we showed that the combination of LY294002 and antiviral drug oseltamivir could effectively reduce the inflammatory damage and pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing in lungs, recovering body weight loss and improving the survival rate from the co-infections. In conclusion, secondary bacterial infection can inhibit autophagy and stimulate mast cell activation through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which might explain why secondary bacterial infection would cause severe and fatal consequences following an initial influenza A viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>rmMANF prevents sepsis-associated lung injury via inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced ferroptosis in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36700778/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protein interaction network between MANF and biomarkers of inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and iron death was constructed by STRING and GeneMania.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rmMANF pretreatment inhibits ferroptosis in septic associated-lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rmMANF pretreatment inhibits ferroptosis by suppressing GRP78/PERK/ATF4 axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis plays a critical role in LPS-induced acute lung injury and is modulated by endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). As a typical ER stress-responsive protein, recently mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) has been demonstrated to attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) through repressing macrophage activation. However, whether MANF exerts a preventive role on ferroptosis and excess ER stress remains unclear. Here, we first built a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to obtain potential interacting proteins related to MANF through STRING and GeneMANIA. Then, male C57BL/6J mice were used to build a model of LPS-induced lung injury. Two days before LPS injection, the tail vein injected recombinant murine MANF (rmMANF) at 750 μg/kg. Twenty-four hours after the LPS injection, the histopathological changes and damage in the lung tissues were detected and scored by HE staining and TUNEL assay, respectively. Endogenous MANF levels, oxidative stress markers (GSH, SOD, CAT, and MDA), ERS markers (GRP78, PERK, and ATF4), and the ferroptosis markers (iron, GPX4, and 4-HNE) in the lung tissues were measured by IHC, western blotting, and commercial kits. Our results showed that LPS induced significant lung injury to the increase in MPO, MDA, and 4-HNE, a decrease in GPX4 and GSH, SOD, CAT, and total iron accumulation in LPS-exposed mice. Simultaneously, GRP78/PERK/ATF4 pathway was notably activated by LPS, accompanied by the down-regulation of MANF. Furthermore, rmMANF pretreatment markedly prevented LPS-induced lung tissue injury and ferroptosis characteristics with the increased GPX4 level in sepsis mice. Finally, we found that LPS-induced oxidative stress and activation of the GRP78/PERK/ATF4 pathway were significantly restrained by rmMANF pretreatment, except for endogenous MANF level. Overall, rmMANF pretreatment can prevent sepsis-associated lung injury by inhibiting ER stress-induced ferroptosis in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>β-hydroxybutyrate inhibits ferroptosis-mediated pancreatic damage in acute liver failure through the increase of H3K9bhb</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferroptosis contributes to pancreatic injury after acute liver failure (ALF)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) restoration alleviates pancreatic injury after ALF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;β-HB induces enrichment of H3K9bhb in the promotor regions of ferroptosis-suppressor genes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;β-HB regulates chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression of ferroptosis-suppressor genes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia are often seen in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study describes pancreatic tissue damage and exocrine dysfunction in a mouse model of major-liver-resection-induced ALF. The analysis of 1,264 clinical cases of liver failure (LF) showed that the incidence of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia in patients with LF is 5.5% and 20%, respectively. Metabolomic studies indicate that glutathione (GSH)-deficiency-caused ferroptosis contributes to pancreatic damage in mouse ALF. β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) is the only metabolite downregulated in the liver, serum, and pancreas. Our data suggest that β-HB protects pancreatic cells and tissues from GSH-deficiency-caused ferroptosis. β-HB administration in ALF mice restores the expression of ferroptosis-suppressor genes through histone H3 lysine 9 β-hydroxybutyrylation (H3K9bhb)-mediated chromatin opening. Our findings highlight β-HB as an endogenous metabolite regulating ferroptosis in the pancreas and extend our understanding of the pathophysiology of ALF-induced pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selective depletion of CD11b-positive monocytes/macrophages potently suppresses bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36700767/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease without effective treatments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD11B-positive monocytes/macrophages increase in the fibrotic lungs and is correlated with pulmonary fibrosis progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD11b conditional depletion suppresses bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD11b contributes to pulmonary fibrosis via altering macrophages polarization and the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2)-sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) signaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD11b may represent a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The understanding of pathogenesis underlying idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is still limited presently. Monocytes or macrophages are involved in progression of the pulmonary injury and repair. The aim of this study is to investigate the roles of CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes/macrophages in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, the expression levels of CD11B gene and inflammatory genes in the IPF patients are evaluated using the available datasets. CD11b cells are conditionally depleted in a CD11b-diptheria toxin receptor (CD11b-DTR) mouse by administration of diptheria toxin (DT). Pulmonary fibrosis in mice is induced using intranasalbleomycin. The mRNAs and proteins expression in lung tissues are determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence (IF) staining and Western-blot assays. It shows that the expression of CD11B mRNA is up-regulated in fibrotic lungs and alveolar macrophages of IPF patients and bleomycin-treated rodents. Selective depletion of CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes/macrophages in CD11b-DTR mice potently halts bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis progression. CD11b depletion inhibits the polarization of macrophages in the fibrotic lungs. Mechanically, CD11b deficiency represses the activation of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2)/sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) signaling during pulmonary fibrosis. In conclusion, our data suggest that CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes/macrophages contribute to pulmonary fibrosis and represent a potential therapeutic target for IPF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tubular epithelial cells-derived small extracellular vesicle-VEGF-A promotes peritubular capillary repair in ischemic kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36528739/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peritubular capillaries (PTCs) are closely related to renal tubules in structure and function, and both are pivotal regulators in the development and progression of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the mechanisms that underlie the interaction between PTCs and tubules during AKI remain unclear. Here we explored a new mode of tubulovascular crosstalk mediated by small extracellular vesicles (sEV) after AKI. In response to renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, endothelial proliferation of PTCs and tubular expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) were increased, accompanied by a remarkable redistribution of cytoplasmic VEGF-A to the basolateral side of tubular cells. Meanwhile, the secretion mode of VEGF-A was converted in the injured tubular cells, which showed a much greater tendency to secrete VEGF-A via sEV other than the free form. Interestingly, tubular cell-derived VEGF-A-enriched sEV (sEV-VEGF-A) turned out to promote endothelial proliferation which was regulated by VEGF receptors 1 and 2. Furthermore, inhibition of renal sEV secretion by Rab27a knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in the proliferation of peritubular endothelial cells in vivo. Importantly, taking advantage of the newly recognized endogenous repair response of PTCs, exogenous supplementation of VEGF-A + sEV efficiently recused PTC rarefaction, improved renal perfusion, and halted the AKI to CKD transition. Taken together, our study uncovered a novel intrinsic repair response after AKI through renal tubule-PTC crosstalk via sEV-VEGF-A, which could be exploited as a promising therapeutic angiogenesis strategy in diseases with ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conjugation of neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 8 (NEDD8) to target proteins, termed neddylation, participates in many cellular processes and is aberrant in various pathological diseases. Its relevance to liver function and failure remains poorly understood. Herein, we show dysregulated expression of NAE1, a regulatory subunit of the only NEDD8 E1 enzyme, in human acute liver failure. Embryonic- and adult-onset deletion of NAE1 in hepatocytes causes hepatocyte death, inflammation, and fibrosis, culminating in fatal liver injury in mice. Hepatic neddylation deficiency triggers oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hepatocyte reprogramming, potentiating liver injury. Importantly, NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), a serine/Thr kinase, is a neddylation substrate. Neddylation of NIK promotes its ubiquitination and degradation. Inhibition of neddylation conversely causes aberrant NIK activation, accentuating hepatocyte damage and inflammation. Administration of N-acetylcysteine, a glutathione surrogate and antioxidant, mitigates liver failure caused by hepatic NAE1 deletion in adult male mice. Therefore, hepatic neddylation is important in maintaining postnatal and adult liver homeostasis, and the identified neddylation targets/pathways provide insights into therapeutically intervening acute liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulation of CD18 stability by SIGIRR-modulated ubiquitination: new insights into the relationship between innate immune response and acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inappropriate accumulation of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and subsequent excessive production of immune responses play critical roles in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI), but the core negative regulators governing innate signalling in AMs are ill defined. We have previously shown that single immunoglobin IL-1 receptor-related protein (SIGIRR), a negative regulator of IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor signalling, inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in AMs. To address the biological relevance of SIGIRR in vivo, we generated a murine ALI model via intratracheal instillation of LPS. Intriguingly, SIGIRR expression was observed to be decreased in resident and recruited macrophages during ALI. This decrease was associated with parallel induction in CD18 protein levels in LPS-challenged lung tissues. Through intranasal injection of SIGIRR lentiviral particles studies, we showed that the overexpression of SIGIRR attenuated recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils, decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and ameliorated pathological changes in lungs. Whilst exploring the basis for this phenotype, SIGIRR was found to be coexpressed with CD18 in AMs, and SIGIRR potentiated the instability of CD18 protein via enhancement of its ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Conversely, by using CD18-/- mice, we further observed that CD18 deletion completely abolished the therapeutic effects of overexpression of SIGIRR on LPS-induced ALI. Mover, overexpression of CD18 in AMs promoted adhesion to ECM components, enhanced TLR4-mediated inflammasome activation and thereby potentiated IL-1β production. These data collectively identify SIGIRR/CD18 as a key negative regulatory circuit maintaining innate immune homeostasis in AMs along the pathogenesis of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional reconstruction of the basal ganglia neural circuit by human striatal neurons in hypoxic-ischaemic injured brain</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36516880/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy is the leading cause of neonatal death and permanent neurological deficits, while the basal ganglia is one of the major nuclei that is selectively and greatly affected in the brains of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy patients, especially in severe cases. Human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons have shown great potential in different types of brain disorders in adults. However, it remains unknown whether and how grafted human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons can repair immature brains with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Here, by administrating genetically labelled human embryonic stem cell-derived striatal neural progenitors into the ipsilateral striatum of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy-injured mice, we found that the grafted cells gradually matured into GABA spiny projection neurons morphologically and electrophysiologically, and significantly rescued the area loss of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy-injured brains. Intriguingly, using immunohistochemical staining combined with enhanced ascorbate peroxidase-based immunoelectron microscopy and rabies virus-mediated trans-synaptic tracing, we show that the grafts start to extend axonal projections to the endogenous target areas (globus pallidus externa, globus pallidus internus, substantia nigra), form synapses with host striatal, globus pallidus and nigra neurons, and receive extensive and stable synaptic inputs as early as 2 months post-transplantation. Importantly, we further demonstrated functional neural circuits re-established between the grafted neurons and host cortical, striatal and substantial nigra neurons at 3-6 months post-transplantation in the hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy-injured brain by optogenetics combined with electrophysiological recording. Finally, the transplanted striatal spiny projection neurons but not spinal GABA neurons restored the motor defects of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, which were reversed by clozapine-N-oxide-based inhibition of graft function. These findings demonstrate anatomical and functional reconstruction of the basal ganglia neural circuit including multiple loops by striatal spiny projection neurons in hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy-injured immature brains, which raises the possibility of such a cell replacement therapeutic strategy for hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy in neonates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 promotes kidney injury by regulating β-catenin signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36520532/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wnt/β-catenin is a developmental signaling pathway that plays a crucial role in driving kidney fibrosis after injury. Activation of β-catenin is presumed to be regulated through the posttranslational protein modification. Little is known about whether β-catenin is also subjected to regulation at the posttranscriptional mRNA level. Here, we report that insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) plays a pivotal role in regulating β-catenin. IGF2BP3 was upregulated in renal tubular epithelium of various animal models and patients with chronic kidney disease. IGF2BP3 not only was a direct downstream target of Wnt/β-catenin but also was obligatory for transducing Wnt signal. In vitro, overexpression of IGF2BP3 in kidney tubular cells induced fibrotic responses, whereas knockdown of endogenous IGF2BP3 prevented the expression of injury and fibrosis markers in tubular cells after Wnt3a stimulation. In vivo, exogenous IGF2BP3 promoted β-catenin activation and aggravated kidney fibrosis, while knockdown of IGF2BP3 ameliorated renal fibrotic lesions after obstructive injury. RNA immunoprecipitation and mRNA stability assays revealed that IGF2BP3 directly bound to β-catenin mRNA and stabilized it against degradation. Furthermore, knockdown of IGF2BP3 in tubular cells accelerated β-catenin mRNA degradation in vitro. These studies demonstrate that IGF2BP3 promotes β-catenin signaling and drives kidney fibrosis, which may be mediated through stabilizing β-catenin mRNA. Our findings uncover a previously underappreciated dimension of the complex regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and suggest a potential target for therapeutic intervention of fibrotic kidney diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heparan sulfate proteoglycan-mediated internalization of extracellular vesicles ameliorates liver fibrosis by targeting hepatic stellate cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence shows that stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown great promise for tissue regeneration and are considered an alternative to cell-based therapy. However, the mechanisms by which EVs induce tissue repair have not been well demonstrated. Previous work indicates that activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) may contribute to the progression of liver fibrosis. Here, we investigate the therapeutic potential of EVs derived from human placental mesenchymal stem cells (hP-MSCs) for the treatment of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury. Our data revealed that EVs derived from hP-MSCs effectively ameliorate liver injury by attenuating inflammation and fibrosis. Further data revealed that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the surface of HSCs mediate the internalization of EVs. Furthermore, EVs could inhibit the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in HSCs through the downregulated TGF-/Smad pathway, which was mediated by miR-744-5p in EVs. Meanwhile, glycosaminoglycans on the surface of EVs play a crucial anti-inflammatory role. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that hP-MSC-derived EVs promote the recovery of liver injury by targeting HSPGs on HSCs and inhibiting liver inflammation through glycosaminoglycans from EVs. These findings may provide a novel theoretical basis for the treatment of liver fibrosis based on EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Locally organised and activated Fth1hi neutrophils aggravate inflammation of acute lung injury in an IL-10-dependent manner</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common respiratory critical syndrome with no effective therapeutic intervention. Neutrophils function in the overwhelming inflammatory process of acute lung injury (ALI) caused by ARDS; however, the phenotypic heterogeneity of pulmonary neutrophils in ALI/ARDS remains largely unknown. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify two transcriptionally and functionally heterogeneous neutrophil populations (Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu and Prok2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu) with distinct locations in LPS-induced ALI mouse lungs. Exposure to LPS promotes the Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu subtype, with more inflammatory factors, stronger antioxidant, and decreased apoptosis under the regulation of interleukin-10. Furthermore, prolonged retention of Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu within lung tissue aggravates inflammatory injury throughout the development of ALI/ARDS. Notably, ARDS patients have high ratios of Fth1 to Prok2 expression in pulmonary neutrophils, suggesting that the Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu population may promote the pathological development and provide a marker of poor outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chemically modified small interfering RNA targeting Hedgehog signaling pathway for rheumatoid arthritis therapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36618268/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease that leads to disability; however, existing therapies are still unsatisfactory. Activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) play an essential role in synovitis formation and joint destruction in RA. The Hedgehog signaling pathway is aberrantly activated and contributes to the aggressive phenotype of RA-FLSs. However, it remains uncertain whether inhibiting Smoothened (SMO), a critical component of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, is an effective treatment for RA. Here, we design a series of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that specifically target the SMO gene. With precise chemical modifications, siRNAs&amp;rsquo; efficacy and stability are significantly improved, and the off-target effects are minimized. The optimized chemically modified siRNA (si-S1A3-Chol) decreases RA-FLS proliferation and invasiveness without the transfection reagent. Furthermore, si-S1A3-Chol injected intra-articularly effectively alleviates joint destruction and improves motor function in collagen-induced arthritis mouse models. Consequently, our results demonstrate that chemically modified siRNA targeting the Hedgehog signaling pathway may be a potential therapy for RA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulatory Fibroblast-Like Synoviocytes Cell Membrane Coated Nanoparticles: A Novel Targeted Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36509660/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are the main cell component in the inflamed joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). FLS intimately interact with infiltrating T cells. Fibroblasts have potent inhibitory effects on T cells, leading to the resolution of inflammation and immune tolerance. However, this &amp;ldquo;regulatory&amp;rdquo; phenotype is defect in RA, and FLS in RA instead act as &amp;ldquo;proinflammatory&amp;rdquo; phenotype mediating inflammation perpetuation. Signals that orchestrate fibroblast heterogeneity remain unclear. Here, it is demonstrated that different cytokines can induce distinct phenotypes of FLS. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is pivotal in inducing the regulatory phenotype of FLS (which is termed FLSreg ) characterized by high expressions of several inhibitory molecules. Rapamycin enhances the effect of IFN-γ on FLS. Based on the characteristics of FLSreg , a novel biomimetic therapeutic strategy for RA is designed by coating cell membrane derived from FLSreg induced by IFN-γ and rapamycin on nanoparticles, which is called FIRN. FIRN show good efficacy, stability, and inflammatory joint targeting ability in an RA mouse model. The findings clarify how fibroblast phenotypes are modulated in the inflammatory microenvironment and provide insights into novel therapeutic designs for autoimmune diseases based on regulatory fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Empagliflozin Protects against Pulmonary Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via an Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases 1 and 2-Dependent Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34893552/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury of the lung can lead to extensive pulmonary damage. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are insulin-independent, oral antihyperglycemic agents used for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although their cardioprotective properties have been reported, their potential roles in pulmonary protection in vivo are poorly characterized. Here, we tested a hypothesis that empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, can protect lungs in a mouse model of lung I/R injury induced by pulmonary hilum ligation in vivo. We assigned C57/BL6 mice to sham-operated, nonempagliflozin-treated control, or empagliflozin-treated groups. Pulmonary I/R injury was induced by 1-hour left hilum ligation followed by 2-hour reperfusion. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and Western blot analysis, we demonstrate that SGLT2 is highly expressed in mouse kidney but is weakly expressed in mouse lung (n = 5-6 per group, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01 or &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Empagliflozin improved respiratory function, attenuated I/R-induced lung edema, lessened structural damage, inhibited apoptosis, and reduced inflammatory cytokine production and protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid [&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 or &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 versus control group (CON)]. In addition, empagliflozin enhanced phosphorylation of pulmonary extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) post-I/R injury in vivo (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, versus CON, n = 5 per group). We further showed that pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 activity reversed these beneficial effects of empagliflozin. In conclusion, we showed that empagliflozin exerts strong lung protective effects against pulmonary I/R injury in vivo, at least in part via the ERK1/2-mediated signaling pathway. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) can exacerbate lung injury. Empagliflozin is a new antidiabetic agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study shows that empagliflozin attenuates lung damage after pulmonary I/R injury in vivo. This protective phenomenon was mediated at least in part via the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2-mediated signaling pathway. This opens a new avenue of research for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in the treatment of reperfusion-induced acute pulmonary injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reprogramming transcription after DNA damage: recognition, response, repair, and restart</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36513571/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent advances in elucidating the role of transcription in DNA damage repair reveal that it has both beneficial and adverse effects on genome stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNA lesion-stalled RNA polymerase (Pol) II triggers the transcription-coupled DNA repair pathway, which involves multiple regulatory factors acting in a concerted and sequential manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transcription is rapidly shut down by DNA damage response (DDR) master regulators, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), using mechanisms that include the direct inhibition of Pol II elongation and the establishment of repressive chromatin environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the damaged DNA is repaired, multiple mechanisms exist to ensure proper and timely restoration of transcription. The inhibition of this process undermines genomic integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome integrity is constantly challenged by endogenous and exogenous insults that cause DNA damage. To cope with these threats, cells have a surveillance mechanism, known as the DNA damage response (DDR), to repair any lesions. Although transcription has long been implicated in DNA repair, how transcriptional reprogramming is coordinated with the DDR is just beginning to be understood. In this review, we highlight recent advances in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying major transcriptional events, including RNA polymerase (Pol) II stalling and transcriptional silencing and recovery, which occur in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, we discuss how such transcriptional adaptation contributes to sensing and eliminating damaged DNA and how it can jeopardize genome integrity when it goes awry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TREM2-dependent macrophage efferocytosis maintains immune homeostasis in the fatty liver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hepatocyte-derived S1P upregulates TREM2 in infiltrated liver macrophages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent obesity causes TREM2 shedding via TNF and IL-1β-induced proteolytic cleavage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of TREM2 disables efferocytosis to license chronic liver inflammation and NASH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity-induced chronic liver inflammation is a hallmark of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)—an aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, it remains unclear how such a low-grade, yet persistent, inflammation is sustained in the liver. Here, we show that the macrophage phagocytic receptor TREM2, induced by hepatocyte-derived sphingosine-1-phosphate, was required for efferocytosis of lipid-laden apoptotic hepatocytes and thereby maintained liver immune homeostasis. However, prolonged hypernutrition led to the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1β in the liver to induce TREM2 shedding through ADAM17-dependent proteolytic cleavage. Loss of TREM2 resulted in aberrant accumulation of dying hepatocytes, thereby further augmenting proinflammatory cytokine production. This ultimately precipitated a vicious cycle that licensed chronic inflammation to drive simple steatosis transition to NASH. Therefore, impaired macrophage efferocytosis is a previously unrecognized key pathogenic event that enables chronic liver inflammation in obesity. Blocking TREM2 cleavage to restore efferocytosis may represent an effective strategy to treat NASH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cerium oxide-based nanozyme suppresses kidney calcium oxalate crystal depositions via reversing hyperoxaluria-induced oxidative stress damage</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36482378/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress damage to renal epithelial cells is the main pathological factor of calcium oxalate calculi formation. The development of medicine that could alleviate oxidative damage has become the key to the prevention and treatment of urolithiasis. Herein, porous nanorods CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (CNPs) were selected from CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with different morphologies as an antioxidant reagent to suppress kidney calcium oxalate crystal depositions with excellent oxidation resistance due to its larger specific surface area. The reversible transformation from Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; could catalyze the decomposition of excess free radicals and act as a biological antioxidant enzyme basing on its strong ability to scavenge free radicals. The protection capability of CNP&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; against oxalate-induced damage and the effect of CNP&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; on calcium oxalate crystallization were studied. CNP&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; could effectively reduce reactive oxygen species production, restore mitochondrial membrane potential polarity, recover cell cycle progression, reduce cell death, and inhibit the formation of calcium oxalate crystals on the cell surface in vitro. The results of high-throughput sequencing of mRNA showed that CNPs could protect renal epithelial cells from oxidative stress damage caused by high oxalate by suppressing the expression gene of cell surface adhesion proteins. In addition, CNP&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; can significantly reduce the pathological damage of renal tubules and inhibit the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in rat kidneys while having no significant side effect on other organs and physiological indicators in vivo. Our results provide a new strategy for CNP&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; as a potential for clinical prevention of crystalline kidney injury and crystal deposition.

      <title>Ventilator-induced Lung Injury Is Modulated by the Circadian Clock</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36480958/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Mechanical ventilation is life-saving but may evoke ventilator-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; To explore how the circadian clock modulates severity of murine ventilator-induced lung injury via the core clock component BMAL1 in myeloid cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Myeloid cell BMAL1-deficient (&lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) or wild type control (&lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1+/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice were subjected to 4 hours mechanical ventilation (34 mL/kg bodyweight) to induce lung injury. Ventilation was initiated at dawn or dusk, or in complete darkness (circadian time 0 or 12) to determine diurnal and circadian effects. Lung injury was quantified by lung function, pulmonary permeability, blood gas analysis, neutrophil recruitment, inflammatory markers and histology. Neutrophil activation and oxidative burst were analyzed ex vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and main results:&lt;/em&gt; In diurnal experiments, mice ventilated at dawn exhibited higher permeability and neutrophil recruitment compared to dusk. Experiments at circadian time showed deterioration of pulmonary function, worsening of oxygenation and increased mortality at circadian time 0 compared to circadian time 12. Wild type neutrophils isolated at dawn showed higher activation and ROS production compared to dusk, while these day-night differences were dampened in &lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; neutrophils. In &lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, circadian variations in VILI severity were dampened and VILI-induced mortality at circadian time 0 was reduced compared with &lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1+/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammatory response and lung barrier dysfunction upon mechanical ventilation exhibit diurnal variations, regulated by the circadian clock. &lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice are less susceptible to ventilation-induced pathology and lack circadian variation of severity compared with &lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1+/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Our data suggest that the internal clock in myeloid cells is an important modulator of ventilator-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Common mechanisms in pediatric acute liver failure</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36496278/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;n 2022 an epidemic of acute hepatitis causing ALF, which affected children aged &amp;lt;5 years, has drawn attention to the lack of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of ALF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most children with ALF during this epidemic were positive for human adenovirus and adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), neither of which is typically linked to ALF in immunocompetent children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children with mutations in genes that form part of the ISR (e.g., PERK) can develop ALF in response to non-hepatotropic viruses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activity in the innate immune system is potentiated by factors derived from the intestinal microbiome and is dependent on Myc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulation of p53 activity is important for determining the balance of hepatocyte senescence and therefore the ability to regenerate during ALF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but potentially fatal disease in children. The etiology is multifactorial, including infection, autoimmune, and genetic disorders, as well as indeterminate hepatitis, which has a higher requirement for liver transplantation. Activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems leads to hepatocyte-specific injury which is mitigated by T regulatory cell activation. Recovery of the native liver depends on activation of apoptotic and regenerative pathways, including the integrated stress response (ISR; e.g., PERK), p53, and HNF4α. Loss-of-function mutations in these pathways cause recurrent ALF in response to non-hepatotropic viruses. Deeper understanding of these mechanisms will lead to improved diagnosis, management, and outcomes for pediatric ALF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened small molecules to identify two compounds, which we named RSL3 and RSL5, that have increased lethality in the presence of oncogenic RAS. Counter screening with biologically active compounds defined aspects of the mechanism of action for RSL3 and RSL5, such as a nonapoptotic, MEK-dependent, and iron-dependent oxidative cell death. Erastin, a previously reported compound with RAS-selective lethality, showed similar properties. RNA interference experiments targeting voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (VDAC3), a target of erastin, demonstrated that RSL5 is a scaffold that acts through VDACs to activate the observed pathway. RSL3 activated a similar death mechanism but in a VDAC-independent manner. We found that cells transformed with oncogenic RAS have increased iron content relative to their normal cell counterparts through upregulation of transferrin receptor 1 and downregulation of ferritin heavy chain 1 and ferritin light chain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery of a pyrano[2,3-b]pyridine derivative YX-2102 as a cannabinoid receptor 2 agonist for alleviating lung fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36474298/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pharmacological modulation of cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) is a promising therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Thus, to develop CB2R selective ligands with new chemical space has attracted much research interests. This work aims to discover a novel CB2R agonist from an in-house library, and to evaluate its therapeutic effects on PF model, as well as to disclose the pharmacological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Virtual screening was used to identify the candidate ligand for CB2R from a newly established in-house library. Both in vivo experiments on PF rat model and in vitro experiments on cells were performed to investigate the therapeutic effects of the lead compound and underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A &amp;ldquo;natural product-like&amp;rdquo; pyrano[2,3-b]pyridine derivative, YX-2102 was identified that bound to CB2R with high affinity. Intraperitoneal YX-2102 injections significantly ameliorated lung injury, inflammation and fibrosis in a rat model of PF induced by bleomycin (BLM). On one hand, YX-2102 inhibited inflammatory response at least partially through modulating macrophages polarization thereby exerting protective effects. Whereas, on the other hand, YX-2102 significantly upregulated CB2R expression in alveolar epithelial cells in vivo. Its pretreatment inhibited lung alveolar epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and PF model induced by transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) via a CB2 receptor-dependent pathway. Further studies suggested that the Nrf2-Smad7 pathway might be involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These findings suggest that CB2R is a potential target for PF treatment and YX-2102 is a promising CB2R agonist with new chemical space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GPR174 knockdown enhances blood flow recovery in hindlimb ischemia mice model by upregulating AREG expression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36473866/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critically involved in neovascularization, an important compensatory mechanism in peripheral artery disease. The contribution of G protein coupled receptor 174 (GPR174), which is a regulator of Treg function and development, in neovascularization remains elusive. Here, we show that genetic deletion of GPR174 in Tregs potentiated blood flow recovery in mice after hindlimb ischemia. GPR174 deficiency upregulates amphiregulin (AREG) expression in Tregs, thereby enhancing endothelial cell functions and reducing pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization and endothelial cell apoptosis. Mechanically, GPR174 regulates AREG expression by inhibiting the nuclear accumulation of early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) via Gαs/cAMP/PKA signal pathway activation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that GPR174 negatively regulates angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in response to ischemic injury and that GPR174 may be a potential molecular target for therapeutic interventions of ischemic vascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Six Months of Exercise Training Improves Ventilatory Responses During Exercise in Adults with Well-healed Burn Injuries</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36729937/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Pulmonary function is lower after a severe burn injury, which could influence ventilatory responses during exercise. It is unclear whether exercise training improves pulmonary function or ventilatory responses during exercise in adults with well-healed burn injuries. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that exercise training improves pulmonary function and ventilatory responses during exercise in adults with well-healed burn injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Thirty-nine adults (28 with well-healed burn injuries &amp;amp; 11 non-burn-injured controls) completed six months of unsupervised, progressive exercise training including endurance, resistance, and high-intensity interval components. Before and after exercise training, we performed comprehensive pulmonary function testing and measured ventilatory responses during cycling exercise. We compared variables using two-way ANOVA (group x time (i.e., pre/post-exercise training) [repeated factor]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Exercise training did not increase percent predicted spirometry, lung diffusing capacity, or airway resistance measures (time: &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≥ 0.14 for all variables). However, exercise training reduced minute ventilation (V̇E; time: &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≤ 0.05 for 50 &amp;amp; 75 watts) and the ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (V̇E/V̇O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; time: &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 for 75 watts) during fixed-load exercise for both groups. The ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (V̇E/V̇CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during exercise at 75 watts was reduced after exercise training (time: &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04). The percentage of age-predicted maximum heart rate at the ventilatory threshold was lower in adults with well-healed burn injuries before (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002), but not after (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.22), exercise training. Lastly, exercise training increased V̇E and reduced V̇E/V̇O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during maximal exercise (time: &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005 for both variables).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These novel findings demonstrate that exercise training can improve ventilatory responses during exercise in adults with well-healed burn injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Necroptosis signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome cross-talking in epithelium facilitate Pseudomonas aeruginosa mediated lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36470578/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, although there is an amount of research just focus on ALI/ ARDS pathophysiological analysis, the development of therapies based on specific molecular targets are still lacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-talking between necroptosis and inflammasome in epithelium promotes pathological damage of ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROS inhibitor Mito-TEMPO blocks inflammasome to alleviate inflammation of ALI, which could be a potential therapeutic target for acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced acute lung injury is such a serious risk to public health, but the pathological regulation remains unclear. Here, we reported that PA mediated epithelial necroptosis plays an important role in pathological process. Pharmacological and genomic ablation of necroptosis signaling ameliorate PA mediated ALI and pulmonary inflammation. Our results further proved NLRP3 inflammasome to involve in the process. Mechanism investigation revealed the cross-talking between inflammasome activation and necroptosis that MLKL-dependent necroptosis signaling promotes the change of mitochondrial membrane potential for the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is the important trigger for functional inflammasome activation. Furthermore, antioxidants such as Mito-TEMPO was confirmed to significantly restrain inflammasome activation in epithelium, resulting in a reduction in PA induced pulmonary inflammation. Taken together, our findings revealed that necroptosis-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome in epithelium plays a crucial role in PA mediated injury, which could be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells may represent a promising cellular therapy for acute lung injury (ALI); however, the underlying relevant molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) were isolated and characterized by alizarin red staining, oil red staining, and flow cytometry. Lung injury and inflammatory cell infiltration were determined using the Evans blue method, wet/dry weight ratio, and H&amp;amp;E staining. An ELISA was used to detect the concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α. Autophagy was detected with an mRFP-GFP-LC3 dual-fluorescence autophagy indicator system, Western blotting, and electron microscopy. We first demonstrated that ADSCs did alleviate the inflammatory responses and tissue damage in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Next, we further demonstrated in vivo that autophagy plays a key role in the maintenance of ADSC therapeutic efficacy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ADSCs co-cultured with alveolar epithelial cells depend on autophagy for significant anti-inflammatory functions. Moreover, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of autophagy. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of ADSC on ALI, especially on alveolar epithelial cells, is dependent on mTOR-mediated autophagy maintenance. The significance of our study for ALI therapy is discussed with respect to a more complete understanding of the therapeutic strategy paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sacubitril/valsartan alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting GSDMD-dependent macrophage pyroptosis in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disorder with intricate pathogenesis. Macrophage pyroptosis reportedly plays a vital role in ALI. Although it has been established that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can reduce sepsis-induced organ injury, the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan (SV) for sepsis has been largely understudied. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of SV in sepsis-induced ALI. Caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) were used to induce polymicrobial sepsis and related ALI. The therapeutic effects of SV in CLP mice were subsequently assessed. Gasdermin D (GSDMD)&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice were used to validate the signalling pathways affected by SV. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and Raw264.7 cells were treated with SV following exposure to lipopolysaccharide and adenosine triphosphate. Finally, the serum obtained from 42 septic patients was used for biochemical analysis. Compared to the other ARBs, SV yielded more pronounced anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, SV decreased mortality rates, significantly reduced lung damage and prevented the inflammatory response in CLP mice. In addition, SV suppressed GSDMD-mediated macrophage pyroptosis in mice. In BMDMs and Raw264.7 cells, the anti-inflammatory and anti-pyroptosis properties of SV were verified. SV treatment effectively inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and prevented macrophage pyroptosis in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that septic individuals had considerably higher serum angiotensin II levels. Overall, we found that SV might prevent ALI in CLP mice by inhibiting GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis of macrophages. Thus, SV might be a viable drug for sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting endogenous kidney regeneration using anti-IL11 therapy in acute and chronic models of kidney disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36470928/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kidney has large regenerative capacity, but this is compromised when kidney damage is excessive and renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) undergo SNAI1-driven growth arrest. Here we investigate the role of IL11 in TECs, kidney injury and renal repair. IL11 stimulation of TECs induces ERK- and p90RSK-mediated GSK3β inactivation, SNAI1 upregulation and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Mice with acute kidney injury upregulate IL11 in TECs leading to SNAI1 expression and kidney dysfunction, which is not seen in Il11 deleted mice or in mice administered a neutralizing IL11 antibody in either preemptive or treatment modes. In acute kidney injury, anti-TGFβ reduces renal fibrosis but exacerbates inflammation and tubule damage whereas anti-IL11 reduces all pathologies. Mice with TEC-specific deletion of Il11ra1 have reduced pathogenic signaling and are protected from renal injury-induced inflammation, fibrosis, and failure. In a model of chronic kidney disease, anti-IL11 therapy promotes TEC proliferation and parenchymal regeneration, reverses fibroinflammation and restores renal mass and function. These data highlight IL11-induced mesenchymal transition of injured TECs as an important renal pathology and suggest IL11 as a therapeutic target for restoring stalled endogenous regeneration in the diseased kidney.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of cannabinoid-2 receptor protects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced acute lung injury and inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463179/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Bacterial pneumonia is a major risk factor for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; (PA), an opportunistic pathogen with an increasing resistance acquired against multiple drugs, is one of the main causative agents of ALI and ARDS in diverse clinical settings. Given the anti-inflammatory role of the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2R), the effect of CB2R activation in the regulation of PA-induced ALI and inflammation was tested in a mouse model as an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In order to activate CB2R, a selective synthetic agonist, JWH133, was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, SR144528 (a selective CB2R antagonist) was administered in combination with JWH133 to test the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effect. PA was administered intratracheally (i.t.) for induction of pneumonia in mice. At 24 h after PA exposure, lung mechanics were measured using the FlexiVent system. The total cell number, protein content, and neutrophil population in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. The bacterial load in the whole lung was also measured. Lung injury was evaluated by histological examination and PA-induced inflammation was assessed by measuring the levels of BALF cytokines and chemokines. Neutrophil activation (examined by immunofluorescence and immunoblot) and PA-induced inflammatory signaling (analyzed by immunoblot) were also studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CB2R activation by JWH133 was found to significantly reduce PA-induced ALI and the bacterial burden. CB2R activation also suppressed the PA-induced increase in immune cell infiltration, neutrophil population, and inflammatory cytokines. These effects were abrogated by a CB2R antagonist, SR144528, further confirming the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effects. CB2R-knock out (CB2RKO) mice had a significantly higher level of PA-induced inflammation as compared to that in WT mice. CB2R activation diminished the excess activation of neutrophils, whereas mice lacking CB2R had elevated neutrophil activation. Pharmacological activation of CB2R significantly reduced the PA-induced NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, whereas CB2KO mice had elevated NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings indicate that CB2R activation ameliorates PA-induced lung injury and inflammation, thus paving the path for new therapeutic avenues against PA pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD44 promotes angiogenesis in myocardial infarction through regulating plasma exosome uptake and further enhancing FGFR2 signaling transduction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463112/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36463112/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since angiogenesis occurs as the pathological process following myocardial infarction to alleviate ischemia, therapeutic angiogenesis has been proposed to be a cardioprotective strategy. CD44 has been implicated in endothelial cell functions and its role has been well established in angiogenesis for years. Although recent studies indicate the close correlation between CD44 and exosome, as well as the two being implicated in myocardial ischemia pathological processes, the effect and the underlying mechanism of CD44 and its regulated plasma exosome in pathological angiogenesis post-myocardial infarction have not been fully elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we used CD44 knockout mice to study the in vivo impacts of CD44 on ischemic angiogenesis in myocardial infarction. Mouse cardiac function was measured by echocardiography, histological changes were observed by Evans Blue and TTC-double staining and Masson’s trichrome staining, and molecular changes were detected by immunofluorescence. In the in vitro study, CD44 knockout HUVECs were generated and CD44 inhibitor was used to study the mechanism of CD44 on angiogenesis. We performed the immunoprecipitation, proximity ligation assay, and super-resolution imaging to study the mechanistic regulation of FGFR2 signaling transduction by CD44. Importantly, we also isolated plasma exosomes from myocardial infarction model mice and studied the effect of plasma exosomes on the activation of the FGFR2 signaling pathway and the related phenotypic alterations, including exosomes uptake and angiogenic function in primary mouse microvascular endothelial cells, and further discovered the regulation mechanism of exosomal miRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed that the expression of CD44 in the border zone of the infarcted heart was tightly related to pathological angiogenesis following myocardial ischemia. The depletion of CD44 impaired angiogenesis and impacts biogenesis and proangiogenic function of plasma exosomes. Subsequently, we found that CD44 mediated the activation of the FGFR2 signaling pathway as well as the caveolin 1-dependent uptake of exosomes in vascular endothelial cells. Most importantly, the proangiogenic therapeutic effect of plasma exosomal miRNAs depended upon the participation of CD44/FGFR2 signaling transduction in vascular endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD44 and its regulated plasma exosomes have crucial potent angiogenic activity. Our studies elucidate that CD44 plays a key role in plasma exosomal miRNA-enhanced angiogenic FGFR2 singling transduction and ischemic angiogenesis in the early stage of myocardial infarction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JMJD3 Is Required for Acute Pancreatitis and Pancreatitis-Associated Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36458991/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be complicated by inflammatory disorders of remote organs, such as lung injury, in which Jumonji domain-containing protein 3 (JMJD3) plays a vital role in proinflammatory responses. Currently, we found that JMJD3 expression was upregulated in the pancreas and lung in an AP male mouse model, which was also confirmed in AP patients. Further experiments revealed that the upregulation of JMJD3 and proinflammatory effects were possibly exerted by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or oxidized-mtDNA from tissue injury caused by AP. The release of mtDNA and oxidized-mtDNA contributed to the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes in lung injury through the stimulator of IFN genes (STING)/TLR9-NF-κB-JMJD3-TNF-α pathway. The inhibition of JMJD3 or utilization of Jmjd3-cKO mice significantly alleviated pulmonary inflammation induced by AP. Blocking mtDNA oxidation or knocking down the TLR9/STING pathway effectively alleviated inflammation. Therefore, inhibition of JMJD3 or STING/TLR9 pathway blockage might be a potential therapeutic strategy to treat AP and the associated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>H3K27 tri-demethylase JMJD3 inhibits macrophage apoptosis by promoting ADORA2A in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36456564/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common critical disease, which is characterized by an uncontrolled, acute inflammatory response, diffuse lung damage and ultimately directly deteriorates into acute respiratory distress syndrome. The number of pro-inflammatory macrophages is related to the severity of ALI. Up-regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophage apoptosis can reduce the pro-inflammatory reactions. Jumonji domain-containing protein D3 (JMJD3)-mediated histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) demethylation may promote the pro-inflammatory response of macrophages under LPS stimulation. However, the mechanism of JMJD3 affecting macrophage apoptosis is still not clear. To explore this gap in knowledge, the ALI mice model with intratracheal administration of LPS and RAW264.7 cells with LPS stimulation were used as in vivo and in vitro experiments. The expression of JMJD3 and H3K27me3 and their cellular localization were analysed in lung tissue. Apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL staining and flow cytometry. Expression of H3K27me3, ADORA2A and C/EBPβ were compared among different treatments and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to investigate the regulatory relationship. Our study showed that JMJD3 expression was upregulated in LPS-induced ALI mice and RAW264.7 cells. JMJD3-indued H3K27me3 demethylation inhibited caspase-3 cleavage by upregulating ADORA2A to decrease LPS-stimulated macrophage apoptosis and promoted the inflammatory reaction. This H3K27me3 demethylation also increased C/EBPβ expression, which may enhance ADORA2A expression further. Besides, inhibiting ADORA2A can also promote LPS-limited macrophage apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of JMJD3 in vivo and in vitro relieved the inhibition of macrophage apoptosis thus leading to the resolution of the inflammation. JMJD3 might inhibit macrophage apoptosis by promoting ADORA2A expression in LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common severe complications among hospitalized patients. In the absence of specific drugs to treat AKI, hemodialysis remains the primary clinical treatment for AKI patients. AKI treatment has received significant attention recently due to the excellent drug delivery capabilities of low-dimensional nanomaterials (LDNs) and their unique therapeutic effects. Diverse LDNs have been proposed to treat AKI, with promising results and the potential for future clinical application. This article aims to provide an overview of the pathogenesis of AKI and the recent advances in the treatment of AKI using different types of LDNs. In addition, it is intended to provide theoretical support for the design of LDNs and implications for AKI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tropoelastin Improves Post-Infarct Cardiac Function</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36453283/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Myocardial infarction (MI) is among the leading causes of death worldwide. Following MI, necrotic cardiomyocytes are replaced by a stiff collagen-rich scar. Compared to collagen, the extracellular matrix protein elastin has high elasticity and may have more favorable properties within the cardiac scar. We sought to improve post-MI healing by introducing tropoelastin, the soluble subunit of elastin, to alter scar mechanics early after MI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and results:&lt;/em&gt; We developed an ultrasound-guided direct intramyocardial injection method to administer tropoelastin directly into the left ventricular anterior wall of rats subjected to induced MI. Experimental groups included shams and infarcted rats injected with either PBS vehicle control or tropoelastin. Compared to vehicle treated controls, echocardiography assessments showed tropoelastin significantly improved left ventricular ejection fraction (64.7±4.4% versus 46.0±3.1% control) and reduced left ventricular dyssynchrony (11.4±3.5 ms versus 31.1±5.8 ms control) 28 days post-MI. Additionally, tropoelastin reduced post-MI scar size (8.9±1.5% versus 20.9±2.7% control) and increased scar elastin (22±5.8% versus 6.2±1.5% control) as determined by histological assessments. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analyses of rat infarcts showed that tropoelastin injection increased genes associated with elastic fiber formation 7 days post-MI and reduced genes associated with immune response 11 days post-MI. To show translational relevance, we performed immunohistochemical analyses on human ischemic heart disease cardiac samples and showed an increase in tropoelastin within fibrotic areas. Using RNA-seq we also demonstrated the tropoelastin gene ELN is upregulated in human ischemic heart disease and during human cardiac fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation. Furthermore, we showed by immunocytochemistry that human cardiac fibroblast synthesize increased elastin in direct response to tropoelastin treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrate for the first time that purified human tropoelastin can significantly repair the infarcted heart in a rodent model of MI and that human cardiac fibroblast synthesize elastin. Since human cardiac fibroblasts are primarily responsible for post-MI scar synthesis, our findings suggest exciting future clinical translation options designed to therapeutically manipulate this synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cannabinoid Receptor 2-Centric Molecular Feedback Loop Drives Necroptosis in Diabetic Heart Injuries</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Diabetic heart dysfunction is a common complication of diabetes. Cell death is a core event that leads to diabetic heart dysfunction. However, the time sequence of cell death pathways and the precise time to intervene of particular cell death type remain largely unknown in the diabetic heart. This study aims to identify the particular cell death type that is responsible for diabetic heart dysfunction and to propose a promising therapeutic strategy by intervening in the cell death pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Type 2 diabetes models were established using db/db leptin receptor-deficient mice and high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced mice. The type 1 diabetes model was established in streptozotocin-induced mice. Apoptosis and programmed cell necrosis (necroptosis) were detected in diabetic mouse hearts at different ages. G protein-coupled receptor-targeted drug library was searched to identify potential receptors regulating the key cell death pathway. Pharmacological and genetic approaches that modulate the expression of targets were used. Stable cell lines and a homemade phosphorylation antibody were prepared to conduct mechanistic studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Necroptosis was activated after apoptosis at later stages of diabetes and was functionally responsible for cardiac dysfunction. Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) was a key regulator of necroptosis. Mechanically, during normal glucose levels, CB2R inhibited S6 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of BACH2 at serine 520, thereby leading to BACH2 translocation to the nucleus, where BACH2 transcriptionally repressed the necroptosis genes Rip1, Rip3, and Mlkl. Under hyperglycemic conditions, high glucose induced CB2R internalization in a β-arrestin 2-dependent manner; thereafter, MLKL (mixed lineage kinase domain-like), but not receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 or 3, phosphorylated CB2R at serine 352 and promoted CB2R degradation by ubiquitin modification. Cardiac re-expression of CB2R rescued diabetes-induced cardiomyocyte necroptosis and heart dysfunction, whereas cardiac knockout of Bach2 diminished CB2R-mediated beneficial effects. In human diabetic hearts, both CB2R and BACH2 were negatively associated with diabetes-induced myocardial injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; CB2R transcriptionally repressed necroptosis through interaction with BACH2; in turn, MLKL formed a negative feedback to phosphorylate CB2R. Our study provides the integrative view of a novel molecular mechanism loop for regulation of necroptosis centered by CB2R, which represents a promising alternative strategy for controlling diabetic heart dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FFAR4 improves the senescence of tubular epithelial cells by AMPK/SirT3 signaling in acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36450712/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious clinical complication with high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite substantial progress in understanding the mechanism of AKI, no effective therapy is available for treatment or prevention. We previously found that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family member free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4) agonist TUG891 alleviated kidney dysfunction and tubular injury in AKI mice. However, the versatile role of FFAR4 in kidney has not been well characterized. In the study, the expression of FFAR4 was abnormally decreased in tubular epithelial cells (TECs) of cisplatin, cecal ligation/perforation and ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced AKI mice, respectively. Systemic and conditional TEC-specific knockout of FFAR4 aggravated renal function and pathological damage, whereas FFAR4 activation by TUG-891 alleviated the severity of disease in cisplatin-induced AKI mice. Notably, FFAR4, as a key determinant, was firstly explored to regulate cellular senescence both in injured kidneys of AKI mice and TECs, which was indicated by senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, marker protein p53, p21, Lamin B1, phospho-histone H2A.X, phospho-Rb expression, and secretory phenotype IL-6 level. Mechanistically, pharmacological activation and overexpression of FFAR4 reversed the decrease of aging-related SirT3 protein, where FFAR4 regulated SirT3 expression to exhibit anti-senescent effect via Gq subunit-mediated CaMKKβ/AMPK signaling in cisplatin-induced mice and TECs. These findings highlight the original role of tubular FFAR4 in cellular senescence via AMPK/SirT3 signaling and identify FFAR4 as a potential drug target against AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFIH1/IRF1/STAT1 promotes sepsis associated inflammatory lung injury via activating macrophage M1 polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36462334/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36462334/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIH1 is activated by infection, which triggers the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor IRF1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRF1 then attaches to the STAT1 promoter region to initiate the transcription of STAT1 and polarization of macrophage M1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRF1 has been identified as the essential molecule that controls the macrophage M1 polarization and the onset of septic ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research has shown that the phenotypic change in macrophages from M0 to M1 is essential for the start of the inflammatory process in septic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Potential treatment targets might be identified with more knowledge of the molecular regulation of M1 macrophages in septic ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-microarray interrelated analysis of high-throughput experiments from ARDS patients and macrophage polarization was conducted to identify the hub genes associated with macrophage M1 polarization and septic ARDS. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Poly (I:C) were utilized to stimulate bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) for M1-polarized macrophage model construction. Knock down of the hub genes on BMDMs via shRNAs was used to screen the genes regulating macrophage M1 polarization in vitro. The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model was constructed in knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice to explore whether the screened genes regulate macrophage M1 polarization in septic ARDS in vivo. ChIP-seq and further experiments on BMDMs were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bioinformatics analysis of gene expression profiles from a clinical cohort of 26 ARDS patients and macrophage polarization found that the 5 hub genes (IFIH1, IRF1, STAT1, IFIT3, GBP1) may have a synergistic effect on macrophage M1 polarization in septic ARDS. Further in vivo investigations indicated that IFIH1, STAT1 and IRF1 contribute to macrophage M1 polarization. The histological evaluation and immunohistochemistry of the lungs from the IRF1-/- and WT mice indicated that knockout of IRF1 markedly alleviated CLP-induced lung injury and M1-polarized infiltration. Moreover, the molecular mechanism investigations indicated that knockdown of IFIH1 markedly promoted IRF1 translocation into the nucleus. Knockout of IRF1 significantly decreases the expression of STAT1. ChIP-seq and PCR further confirmed that IRF1, as a transcription factor of STAT1, binds to the promoter region of STAT1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRF1 was identified as the key molecule that regulates macrophage M1polarization and septic ARDS development in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, as the adaptor in response to infection mimics irritants, IFIH1 promotes IRF1 (transcription factor) translocation into the nucleus to initiate STAT1 transcription.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chlorine (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas is a toxic industrial chemical (TIC) that poses a hazard to human health following accidental and/or intentional (e.g. terrorist) release. By using a murine model of sub-lethal Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposure we have examined the airway hyper responsiveness, cellular infiltrates, transcriptomic and proteomic responses of the lung. In the “crisis” phase at 2 h and 6 h there is a significant decreases in leukocytes within bronchoalveolar lavage fluid accompanied by an upregulation within the proteome of immune pathways ultimately resulting in neutrophil influx at 24 h. A flip towards “repair” in the transcriptome and proteome occurs at 24 h, neutrophil influx and an associated drop in the lung function persisting until 14 d post-exposure and subsequent “recovery” after 28 days. Collectively, this research provides new insights into the mechanisms of damage, early global responses and processes of repair induced in the lung following the inhalation of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory response which causes serious damages to alveolar epithelia and vasculature, and it still remains high lethality and mortality with no effective treatment. Based on the inflammatory homing of platelets and cell membrane cloaking nanotechnology, in this study we developed a biomimetic anti-inflammation nanoparticle delivery system for ALI treatment. PM@Cur-RV NPs were designed by combining the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (NPs) coated with platelet membrane vesicles (PM) for the purpose of highly targeting delivery of curcumin (Cur) and resveratrol (RV) to inflammatory lungs. PM@Cur-RV NPs showed good biocompatibility and biosafety both in vitro and in vivo. Accumulation of NPs into lung tract was observed after inhaled NPs. Remarkably, the inhalation of PM@Cur-RV NPs effectively inhibited lung vascular injury evidenced by the decreased lung vascular permeability, and the reduced proinflammatory cytokine burden in an ALI mouse model. The analysis of infiltrated macrophages in the lungs showed that the Cur-RV-modulated macrophage polarized towards M2 phenotype and the decreased histone lactylation might contribute to their anti-inflammation effects. Together, this work highlights the potential of inhalation of biomimetic nanoparticle delivery of curcumin and resveratrol for the treatment of pulmonary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Injectable double-network hydrogel for corneal repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/cej.2022.140698/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injuries to the cornea can cause corneal opacity or even blindness. Especially scald wounds and chemical burns to the cornea can usually lead to loss of corneal epithelium function and deep damage to the corneal stroma. Injectable hydrogel has been widely applied in corneal tissue engineering because it is easy to handle and can completely fill the defect area with minimally invasive surgical procedures. To reduce the risk and complications of penetrating keratoplasty and lamellar keratoplasty and to meet the demand for donated cornea, an injectable double-network (IDN) hydrogel based on methacrylated gelatin (Gel-MA) and oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA) was constructed for focal corneal defect repairing. The Gel-MA/OHA IDN hydrogel had an interconnected porous microstructure and tunable mechanical properties with a modulus between 3.4 and 176.4 kPa. The hydrogel could promote cell adhesion and proliferation and afford the sustained release of hydrophilic/hydrophobic drugs. &lt;em&gt;In-vivo&lt;/em&gt; corneal repair was performed by injecting the precursors into the pre-drilled epithelial-stromal defects of New Zealand White rabbits followed by immediate &lt;em&gt;in-situ&lt;/em&gt; UV crosslinking. The results showed that the hydrogel had a strong capacity to promote corneal regeneration. Optical coherence tomography, slip lamp, fluorescein staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and haematoxylin &amp;amp; eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining were employed to illustrate the effectiveness and safety of corneal tissue regeneration. All the results showed that the optimized Gel-MA/OHA IDN hydrogel possessed excellent biocompatibility and could promote cornea repair &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. This study suggests that the injectable biocompatible double network hydrogel may provide a good choice for corneal repair and regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://example.com/article/36523634/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a prevalent illness in intensive care units. Extracellular vesicles and particles released from activated alveolar macrophages (AMs) assist in ARDS lung injury and the inflammatory process through mechanisms that are unclear. This study investigated the role of AM-derived secretory autophagosomes (SAPs) in lung injury and microRNA (MiR)-199a-3p-regulated inflammation associated with ARDS in vitro and in a murine model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The ARDS model in mouse was established by intratracheal LPS lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. The agomirs or antagomirs of MiR-199a-3p were injected into the caudal vein to figure out whether MiR-199a-3p could influence ARDS inflammation and lung injury, whereas the mimics or inhibitors of MiR-199a-3p, siRNA of Rab8a, or PAK4 inhibitor were transfected or applied to RAW264.7 cells to evaluate the mechanism of SAP release. Culture supernatants of RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice were collected for the isolation of SAPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that MiR-199a-3p was over-expressed in the lungs of ARDS mice. The MiR-199a-3p antagomir alleviated, whereas the MiR-199a-3p agomir exacerbated LPS-induced inflammation in mice by promoting AM-derived SAP secretion. In addition, MiR-199a-3p over-expression exacerbated LPS-induced ARDS via activating Rab8a, and Rab8a silencing significantly suppressed the promoting influence of the MiR-199a-3p mimic on SAP secretion. Furthermore, MiR-199a-3p mimic activated Rab8a by directly inhibiting PAK4 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The novel finding of this study is that MiR-199a-3p participated in the regulation of SAP secretion and the inflammatory process via targeting of PAK4/Rab8a, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for ARDS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Proteomic Analysis of NETosis in Trauma: Emergence of SerpinB1 as a Key Player</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36730076/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis) may mediate post-injury organ dysfunction, but mechanisms remain unclear. The intracellular serine protease inhibitor (serpin) B1 is vital to neutrophil function and has been shown to restrict NETosis in inflammatory settings. In this study, we utilized discovery proteomics to identify the proteomic signature of trauma-induced NETosis. We hypothesized that serpinB1 would be a major component of this NET protein profile and associated with adverse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; This was a post hoc analysis of data collected as part of the COMBAT randomized clinical trial. Blood was collected from injured patients at a single Level I Trauma Center. Proteomic analyses were performed through targeted liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Abundances of serpinB1 and known NETosis markers were analyzed with patient and injury characteristics, clinical data, and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; SerpinB1 levels on ED arrival were significantly correlated with proteomic markers of NETosis, including core histones, transketolase, and S100A8/A9 proteins. More severely injured patients had elevated serpinB1 and NETosis markers on ED arrival. Levels of serpinB1 and top NETosis markers were significantly elevated on ED arrival in non-survivors and patients with fewer ventilator- and ICU-free days. In proteome-wide ROC analysis, serpinB1 was consistently among the top proteins associated with adverse outcomes. Among NETosis markers, levels of serpinB1 early in the patient&amp;rsquo;s course exhibited the greatest separation between patients with fewer and greater ventilator- and ICU-free days. Gene Ontology analysis of top predictors of adverse outcomes further supports NETosis as a potential mediator of post-injury organ dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We have identified a proteomic signature of trauma-induced NETosis, and NETosis is an early process following severe injury that may mediate organ dysfunction. In addition, serpinB1 is a major component of this NET protein profile that may serve as an early marker of excessive NETosis after injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evidence:&lt;/em&gt; Level III, Prognostic/Epidemiological.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amorphous silica nanoparticles caused lung injury through the induction of epithelial apoptosis via ROS/Ca2&#43;/DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission signaling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adverse effects of amorphous silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) exposure on the respiratory system were increasingly recognized, however, its potential pathogenesis still remains not fully elucidated. So, this study aimed to explore its effects on pulmonary injury, and to investigate related mechanisms. Histological investigations illustrated SiNPs triggered the lung injury, mainly manifested as alveolar structure destruction, collagen deposition, and mitochondrial ultrastructural injury. In particular, SiNPs greatly enhanced pulmonary ROS and TUNEL positive rate in lungs, both of which were positively correlated with lung impairments. Further, the underlying mechanisms were investigated in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). Consistent with the &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; findings, SiNPs caused the impairments on mitochondrial structure, as well as the activation of ROS generation and oxidative injury. Upon SiNPs stimuli, mitochondrial respiration was greatly inhibited, while Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload in cytosol and mitochondria owing to ER calcium release was noticed, resulting in mitochondrial-dependent epithelial apoptosis. More importantly, mitochondrial dynamics was imbalanced toward a fission type, as evidenced by upregulated DRP1 and its phosphorylation at Ser616 (DRP1&lt;sup&gt;s616&lt;/sup&gt;), while downregulated DRP1&lt;sup&gt;s637&lt;/sup&gt;, and also MFN1, MFN2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the activation of ROS/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling promoted DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission by SiNPs, forming a vicious cycle, and ultimately contributing to apoptosis in 16HBE. In summary, our results disclosed SiNPs caused pulmonary injury through the induction of epithelial apoptosis via a ROS/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) can initiate an adaptive response to completely recover from mild acute kidney injury (AKI), whereas severe injury often leads to persistence of maladaptive repair and progression to kidney fibrosis. Through profiling of active DNA regulatory elements by ATAC-seq, we reveal widespread, dynamic changes in the chromatin accessibility of TECs after ischemia–reperfusion injury. We show that injury-specific domains of regulatory chromatin become accessible prior to gene activation, creating poised chromatin states to activate the consequent gene expression program and injury response. We further identify RXRα as a key transcription factor in promoting adaptive repair. Activation of RXRα by bexarotene, an FDA-approved RXRα agonist, restores the chromatin state and gene expression program to protect TECs against severe kidney injury. Together, our findings elucidate a chromatin-mediated mechanism underlying differential responses of TECs to varying injuries and identify RXRα as a therapeutic target of acute kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial citrate accumulation drives alveolar epithelial cell necroptosis in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necroptosis is the major cause of death in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) during acute lung injury (ALI). Here, we report a previously unrecognized mechanism for necroptosis. We found an accumulation of mitochondrial citrate (citratemt) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated AECs because of the downregulation of Idh3α and citrate carrier (CIC, also known as Slc25a1). shRNA- or inhibitor-mediated inhibition of Idh3α and Slc25a1 induced citratemt accumulation and necroptosis in vitro. Mice with AEC-specific Idh3α and Slc25a1 deficiency exhibited exacerbated lung injury and AEC necroptosis. Interestingly, the overexpression of Idh3α and Slc25a1 decreased citratemt levels and rescued AECs from necroptosis. Mechanistically, citratemt accumulation induced mitochondrial fission and excessive mitophagy in AECs. Furthermore, citratemt directly interacted with FUN14 domain-containing protein 1 (FUNDC1) and promoted the interaction of FUNDC1 with dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), leading to excessive mitophagy-mediated necroptosis and thereby initiating and promoting ALI. Importantly, necroptosis induced by citratemt accumulation was inhibited in FUNDC1-knockout AECs. We show that citratemt accumulation is a novel target for protection against ALI involving necroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attenuation of the Severity of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by Pomiferin through Blocking Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in an AKT/Foxo1 Pathway-Dependent Manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36471865/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) gives rise to uncontrolled inflammatory response and oxidative stress, causing very high mortality globally. Pomiferin is a kind of prenylated isoflavonoid extracted from &lt;em&gt;Maclura pomifera&lt;/em&gt;, owning anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the functions and possible mechanisms of pomiferin in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ARDS remain unknown. C57BL/6 mice were injected with LPS (5 mg/kg) intratracheally to induce an in vivo ARDS model while RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) to induce an in vitro model. Our data demonstrated that pomiferin (20 mg/kg) significantly improved pulmonary function and lung pathological injury in mice with ARDS, apart from increasing survival rate. Meanwhile, pomiferin treatment also inhibited LPS-induced inflammation as well as oxidative stress in lung tissues. LPS stimulation significantly activated AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway in lung tissues, which could be reversed after pomiferin treatment. In vitro experiments further showed that 10, 20, and 50 μM of pomiferin could enhance cell viability of RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with LPS. What is more, 3-deoxysappanchalcone (3-DE), one AKT agonist, was used to active AKT in RAW264.7 macrophages. The results further showed that 3-DE could abolish pomiferin-elicited protection in LPS-treated RAW264.7 macrophages, evidenced by activated inflammation and oxidative stress. Taken together, our study showed that pomiferin could exert an ARDS-protective effect by blocking the AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway to inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative injury, which may serve as a potential candidate for the treatment of ARDS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine is a biomarker and potential therapeutic target for community-acquired pneumonia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lysophosphatidylcholine decreases in CAP patients during the acute phase of the disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPC14:0 demonstrates excellent diagnostic performance in predicting CAP disease severity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPC14:0 exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects in vivo and in vitro experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no gold standard for evaluating the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and it is still based on a score. This study aimed to use the metabolomics method to find promised biomarkers in assessing disease severity and potential therapeutic targets for CAP. The result found that the metabolites in the plasma samples of CAP patients had significantly different between the acute phase and the remission phase, especially lysophosphatidylcholine (LPCs) in glycerophospholipids, whose levels are negatively linked to the severity of the disease. Subsequently, the two key metabolites of myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC 14:0) and LPC 16:1 were screened. We analyzed the predictive performance of the two metabolites using Spearman-related analysis and ROC curves, and LPC14:0 showed more satisfactory diagnostic performance than LPC16:1. Then we explored the protective role and mechanism of LPC 14:0 in animal and cell models. The results showed that LPC 14:0 could inhibit the LPS-induced secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, lower the ROS and MDA levels, and decreased the depletion of SOD and GSH, thereby reducing lung tissue and cell damage, such as down-regulating the protein level in BALF, lung W/D ratio, MPO activity, and apoptosis. We found that LPC 14:0 inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress, and the above protection was achieved by inhibiting LPS-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. LPC 14:0 may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting the severity of CAP. In addition, our exploration of the role of LPC 14:0 in animal and cellular models has reinforced its promise as a therapeutic target to improve the clinical efficacy for CAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPS-induced alveolar macrophage inflammation and alveolar epithelial cell death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIT1 could relieve LPS-induced acute lung injury model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIT1 decreased TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 expression in MH-S cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIT1 suppressed MLE-12 cell apoptosis induced by MH-S cell supernatant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is featured by intensive inflammatory responses causing significant morbidity and mortality. Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), induced by interferon (IFN), has been discovered to modulate viral infection and cell apoptosis and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, it’s role and mechanism in ALI remain unclear and need to be explored furtherly. Here, we discovered that IFIT1 decreased the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in mouse-derived macrophage cells (MH-S) and alleviated apoptosis of murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) induced by MH-S cell supernatant, contributing to anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis (RNA-seq) showed that inflammatory chemokine Csingle bondC motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) partially eliminated the protective effects of IFIT1 and promoted the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 by CCL5-p65NF-κB signaling pathway. This study demonstrated that IFIT1 attenuated ALI-associated inflammation and cell apoptosis by regulating the CCL5-p65NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings are of great significance for the treatment of lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sirt3 mitigates LPS-induced mitochondrial damage in renal tubular epithelial cells by deacetylating YME1L1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36433732/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is often secondary to sepsis. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathological process of AKI. In this study, we aimed to examine the regulatory roles of Sirt3 in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mitochondrial damage in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). Sirt3 knockout mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS, and cultured TECs were stimulated with LPS to evaluate the effects of Sirt3 on mitochondrial structure and function in TECs. Electron microscopy was used to assess mitochondrial morphology. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect protein expression and examine mitochondrial morphology. Western blotting was used to quantify protein expression. We observed that LPS increased apoptosis, induced disturbances in mitochondrial function and dynamics, and downregulated Sirt3 expression in a sepsis-induced AKI mouse model and human proximal tubular (HK-2) cells in vitro. Sirt3 deficiency further exacerbated LPS-induced renal pathological damage, apoptosis and disturbances in mitochondrial function and dynamics. On the contrary, Sirt3 overexpression in HK-2 cells alleviated these lesions. Functional studies revealed that Sirt3 overexpression alleviated LPS-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in TECs by promoting OPA1-mediated mitochondrial fusion through the deacetylation of i-AAA protease (YME1L1), an upstream regulatory molecule of OPA1. Our study has identified Sirt3 as a vital factor that protects against LPS-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in TECs via the YME1L1-OPA1 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) remains a global public health issue without specific and effective treatment options available in the clinic. Alveolar macrophage polarization is involved in the initiation, development and progression of ALI; however, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) acts as an antioxidant in pulmonary inflammation and has been demonstrated to be linked with the severity and prognosis of ALI. In this study, the therapeutic effects of HO-1 were examined, along with the mechanisms involved, mainly focusing on alveolar macrophage polarization. HO-1 depletion induced higher iNOS and CD86 (M1 phenotype) expression but was significantly decreased in Arg-1 and CD206 (M2 phenotype) expression in BALF alveolar macrophages after equivalent LPS stimulation. We also found that HO-1 deletion distinctly accelerated the expression of inflammasome-associated components NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 in vivo and in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, on the basis of LPS for MH-S cells, levels of TXNIP, NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 were increased and HO-1 depletion exacerbated these changes, whereas double depletion of HO-1 and TXNIP partially mitigated these elevations. Also, HO-1 knockdown induced more M1 phenotype and less M2 phenotype compared with LPS alone, whereas double silence of HO-1 and TXNIP partially changed the polarization state. Taken together, we demonstrated that HO-1 could modulate macrophage polarization via TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway, which could be a potential therapeutic target for ALI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activation of endogenous neurogenesis by bioactive materials enables restoration of sensory/motor function after complete spinal cord injury (SCI) via formation of new relay neural circuits. The underlying wiring logic of newborn neurons in adult central nervous system (CNS) is unknown. Here, we report neurotrophin3-loaded chitosan biomaterial substantially recovered bladder function after SCI. Multiple neuro-circuitry tracing technologies using pseudorabies virus (PRV), rabies virus (RV), and anterograde adeno-associated virus (AAV), demonstrated that newborn neurons were integrated into the micturition neural circuits and reconnected higher brain centers and lower spinal cord centers to control voiding, and participated in the restoration of the lower urinary tract function, even in the absence of long-distance axonal regeneration. Opto- and chemo-genetic studies further supported the notion that the supraspinal control of the lower urinary tract function was partially recovered. Our data demonstrated that regenerated relay neurons could be properly integrated into disrupted long-range neural circuits to restore function of adult CNS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective effect and mechanism of baicalin on lung inflammatory injury in BALB/cJ mice induced by PM2.5</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respiratory function impairment caused by PM2.5 exposure could be improved by baicalin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baicalin regulates the composition and diversity of pharyngeal microbiota in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baicalin alleviates the respiratory inflammatory response caused by PM2.5 exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baicalin exerts anti-inflammatory effects by the HMGB1/NLRP3/Casepase1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public health harms caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have become a global focus, with PM2.5 exposure recognized as a critical risk factor for global morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation is the common pathophysiological feature of respiratory diseases induced by PM2.5 and is the most critical cause of all these diseases. However, presently there is a lack of effective preventive and therapeutic approaches for inflammatory lung injuries caused by PM2.5 exposure. Baicalin is a herb-derived effective flavonoid compound with multiple health benefits. This study established a murine lung inflammatory injury model via inhalation of PM2.5 aerosols. The data showed that after baicalin intervention, lung injury pathological score of baicalin (4.16 ± 0.54, 3.33 ± 0.76, 4.00 ± 0.45) and claricid (3.00 ± 0.78) treatments were markedly lower than PM2.5-treated mice (6.17 ± 0.31), and pathological damage was alleviated. Compared to the PM2.5 group, the spleen and lung indexes in the baicalin and claricid groups were significantly reduced. The inflammatory cytokines of TNF-α, IL-18, and IL-1β in serum, alveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissue were significantly decreased in the baicalin and claricid groups. The expressions of inflammatory pathway-related genes and proteins HMGB1, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 were up-regulated in the PM2.5 group. The expressions of these genes and proteins were significantly decreased following baicalin treatment. The lung function indicators showed that the MV (65.94 ± 8.19 mL), sRaw (1.79 ± 0.08 cm H2O.s), and FRC (0.52 ± 0.01 mL) in the PM2.5 group were higher than in the control and baicalin groups, and respiratory function was improved by baicalin. PM2.5 exposure markedly altered the bacterial composition at the genus level. The dominant flora relative abundances of uncultured_bacterium_f_Muribaculaceae, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus, were decreased from the control group (9.20%, 8.53%, 6.21%) to PM2.5 group (6.26%, 5.49%, 4.77%), respectively. Following baicalin intervention, the relative abundances were 9.72%, 6.65%, and 3.57%, respectively. Therefore, baicalin could potentially prevent and improve mice lung inflammatory injury induced by PM2.5 exposure. Baicalin might provide a protective role by balancing oropharyngeal microbiota and affecting the expression of the HMGB1/Caspase1 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endothelial cell injury plays a critical part in ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) and participates in the progression of AKI. Targeting renal endothelial cell therapy may ameliorate vascular injury and further improve the prognosis of ischemic AKI. Here, P-selectin as a biomarker of ischemic AKI in endothelial cells is identified and P-selectin binding peptide (PBP)-engineered extracellular vesicles (PBP-EVs) with imaging and therapeutic functions are developed. The results show that PBP-EVs exhibit a selective targeting tendency to injured kidneys, while providing spatiotemporal information for the early diagnosis of AKI by quantifying the expression of P-selectin in the kidneys by molecular imaging. Meanwhile, PBP-EVs reveal superior nephroprotective functions in the promotion of renal repair and inhibition of fibrosis by alleviating inflammatory infiltration, improving reparative angiogenesis, and ameliorating maladaptive repair of the renal parenchyma. In conclusion, PBP-EVs, as an ischemic AKI theranostic system that is designed in this study, provide a spatiotemporal diagnosis in the early stages of AKI to help guide personalized therapy and exhibit superior nephroprotective effects, offering proof-of-concept data to design EV-based theranostic strategies to promote renal recovery and further improve long-term outcomes following AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1,2,3,4,6-O-Pentagalloylglucose Protects against Acute Lung Injury by Activating the AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 Pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious lung disease with a high mortality rate, warranting the development of novel therapies. Previously, we reported that 1,2,3,4,6-O-pentagalloylglucose (PGG) could afford protection against ALI, however, the PGG-mediated protective effects remain elusive. Herein, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) markedly inhibited the lung wet/drug weight ratio and attenuated histological changes in the lungs (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). A pretreatment with PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) reduced the number of total leukocytes and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) also attenuated oxidative stress by reducing the formation of formation and the depletion of superoxide dismutase to treat an ALI (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). To further explore the PGG-induced mechanism against an ALI, we screened the PGG pathway using immunohistochemical analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and Western blotting (WB). WB revealed that the expression levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (p-AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B phosphorylation (P-Akt), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) were significantly higher in the PGG group (60 and 30 mg/kg) than in the lipopolysaccharide group (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05); these findings were confirmed by the immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence results. Accordingly, PGG could be effective against an ALI by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress via AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling, allowing for the potential development of this as a natural drug against an ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A human kidney and liver organoid-based multi-organ-on-a-chip model to study the therapeutic effects and biodistribution of mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36382606/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) show therapeutic potential in multiple disease models, including kidney injury. Clinical translation of sEVs requires further preclinical and regulatory developments, including elucidation of the biodistribution and mode of action (MoA). Biodistribution can be determined using labelled sEVs in animal models which come with ethical concerns, are time-consuming and expensive, and may not well represent human physiology. We hypothesised that, based on developments in microfluidics and human organoid technology, in vitro multi-organ-on-a-chip (MOC) models allow us to study effects of sEVs in modelled human organs like kidney and liver in a semi-systemic manner. Human kidney- and liver organoids combined by microfluidic channels maintained physiological functions, and a kidney injury model was established using hydrogenperoxide. MSC-sEVs were isolated, and their size, density and potential contamination were analysed. These sEVs stimulated recovery of the renal epithelium after injury. Microscopic analysis shows increased accumulation of PKH67-labelled sEVs not only in injured kidney cells, but also in the unharmed liver organoids, compared to healthy control conditions. In conclusion, this new MOC model recapitulates therapeutic efficacy and biodistribution of MSC-sEVs as observed in animal models. Its human background allows for in-depth analysis of the MoA and identification of potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating hyaluronic acid signature in CAP and ARDS - the role of pneumolysin in hyaluronic acid shedding</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36456058/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soluble HA levels are elevated in CAP and ARDS plasma and are associated with an increase in 28-day mortality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soluble HA levels correlate with disease severity and markers of inflammation, endothelial cell activation, and basement membrane destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small and large HA fragments are detected in plasma of most severe CAP or ARDS patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pneumolysin induces HA release from human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pneumolysin-induced HA shedding is dependent on reactive oxygen species production and is not associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shedding of hyaluronan (HA), the component of endothelial cell (EC) glycocalyx, has been associated with acute lung injury. HA degradation allows plasma proteins and fluid to penetrate across the vascular wall leading to lung edema formation and leukocyte recruitment. Here, we analyzed sHA levels and size in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), correlated them to disease severity, and evaluated the impact of pneumolysin (PLY), the Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.p.) exotoxin, on HA shedding from human pulmonary microvascular EC (HPMVEC). sHA levels were elevated in CAP and ARDS and correlated with the CRB65 severity score and with markers of inflammation (interleukin-6), EC activation (E-selectin), and basement membrane destruction (collagen IV). Furthermore, sHA levels were associated with an increase in 28-day mortality. Small and large sHA fragments were detected in plasma of most severe CAP or ARDS patients, and the presence of large sHA fragments was accompanied by the elevated levels of circulating collagen IV. In vitro, PLY induced sHA release from HPMVEC. This effect was dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and was not associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction. Conversely, HA shedding was impaired following HPMVEC infection with a S.p. PLY-deficient mutant. Our study identifies association between the severity of CAP and ARDS and the levels and size of sHA in plasma. It links sHA levels with, inflammation, EC activation status and basement membrane disassembly in ARDS and provides insights into the mechanism of HA shedding during infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lactoferrin Ameliorates Ovalbumin-Induced Asthma in Mice through Reducing Dendritic-Cell-Derived Th2 Cell Responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36430662/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease with symptoms such as expiratory airflow narrowing and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Millions of people suffer from asthma and are at risk of life-threatening conditions. Lactoferrin (LF) is a glycoprotein with multiple physiological functions, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antitumoral activities. LF has been shown to function in immunoregulatory activities in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) in mice. Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of LF in AHR and the functions of dendritic cells (DCs) and Th2-related responses in asthma. Twenty 8-week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into normal control (NC), ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized, and OVA-sensitized with low dose of LF (100 mg/kg) or high dose of LF (300 mg/kg) treatment groups. The mice were challenged by intranasal instillation with 5% OVA on the 21st to 27th day after the start of the sensitization period. The AHR, cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and pulmonary histology of each mouse were measured. Serum OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 and OVA-specific splenocyte responses were further detected. The results showed that LF exhibited protective effects in ameliorating AHR, as well as lung inflammation and damage, in reducing the expression of Th2 cytokines and the secretion of allergen-specific antibodies, in influencing the functions of DCs, and in decreasing the level of Th2 immune responses in a BALB/c mouse model of OVA-induced allergic asthma. Importantly, we demonstrated that LF has practical application in reducing DC-induced Th2 cell responses in asthma. In conclusion, LF exhibits anti-inflammation and immunoregulation activities in OVA-induced allergic asthma. These results suggest that LF may act as a supplement to prevent asthma-induced lung injury and provide an additional agent for reducing asthma severity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of folic acid on oxidative damage of kidney in lead-exposed rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36458173/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Lead (Pb) has many applications in daily life, but in recent years, various problems caused by lead exposure have aroused people&amp;rsquo;s concern. Folic acid is widely found in fruits and has received more attention for its antioxidant function. However, the role of folic acid in lead-induced kidney injury in rats is unclear. This study was designed to investigate the effects of folic acid on oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the kidney of rats caused by lead exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Forty specific pathogen-free male Rattus norvegicus rats were randomly divided into control, lead, intervention, and folic acid groups. The levels of SOD, GSH-Px, GSH, and MDA were measured by biochemical kits. The protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1, CHOP, and GRP78 were measured by immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; This study showed that lead exposure increased the blood levels of lead in mice. However, the intervention of folic acid decreased the levels of lead, but the difference was not statistically significant. Lead exposure causes oxidative stress by decreasing kidney SOD, GSH-Px, and GSH levels and increasing MDA levels. However, folic acid alleviated the oxidative damage caused by lead exposure by increasing the levels of GSH-Px and GSH and decreasing the levels of MDA. Immunofluorescence results showed that folic acid intervention downregulated the upregulation of kidney Nrf2, HO-1, GRP78, and CHOP expression caused by lead exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt; Overall, folic acid alleviates kidney oxidative stress induced by lead exposure by regulating Nrf2 and HO-1, while regulating CHOP and GRP78 to mitigate apoptosis caused by excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Melatonin Suppresses Macrophage M1 Polarization and ROS-Mediated Pyroptosis via Activating ApoE/LDLR Pathway in Influenza A-Induced Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36425057/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza virus infection is one of the strongest pathogenic factors for the development of acute lung injury (ALI)/ acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms have not been clarified. In this study, we aim to investigate whether melatonin modulates macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis via activating Apolipoprotein E/low-density lipoprotein receptor (ApoE/LDLR) pathway in influenza A-induced ALI. Here, wild-type (WT) and ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice were instilled intratracheally with influenza A (H3N2) and injected intraperitoneally with melatonin for 7 consecutive days. In vitro, WT and ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were pretreated with melatonin before H3N2 stimulation. The results showed that melatonin administration significantly attenuated H3N2-induced pulmonary damage, leukocyte infiltration, and edema; decreased the expression of proinflammatory M1 markers; enhanced anti-inflammatory M2 markers; and switched the polarization of alveolar macrophages (AMs) from M1 to M2 phenotype. Additionally, melatonin inhibited reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) mediated pyroptosis shown by downregulation of malonaldehyde (MDA) and ROS levels as well as inhibition of the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Strikingly, the ApoE/LDLR pathway was activated when melatonin was applied in H3N2-infected macrophages and mice. ApoE knockout mostly abrogated the protective impacts of melatonin on H3N2-induced ALI and its regulatory ability on macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis. Furthermore, recombinant ApoE3 (re-ApoE3) inhibited H3N2-induced M1 polarization of BMDMs with upregulation of MT1 and MT2 expression, but re-ApoE2 and re-ApoE4 failed to do this. Melatonin combined with re-ApoE3 played more beneficial protective effects on modulating macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis in H3N2-infected ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; BMDMs. Our study indicated that melatonin attenuated influenza A- (H3N2-) induced ALI by inhibiting the M1 polarization of pulmonary macrophages and ROS-mediated pyroptosis via activating the ApoE/LDLR pathway. This study suggested that melatonin-ApoE/LDLR axis may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for influenza virus-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astaxanthin ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via inhibition of inflammatory reactions and modulation of the SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36278420/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a systemic inflammatory process. A large number of studies have shown that astaxanthin (ASTA) has strong anti-inflammatory effects and almost non-toxic side effects. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of ASTA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice and its underlying mechanism. The result showed that compared with the LPS group, the expression levels of the respiratory resistance (Re), inspiratory resistance (Ri), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio, albumin (BA/SA) ratio and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the ASTA pretreatment group were significantly reduced, and total cell, neutrophil and macrophage counts were significantly decreased. HE staining results showed that alveolar interstitial edema, bleeding and erythrocyte exudation were reduced. Compared with the LPS group, the percentage of Th17 cells and the content of interleukin (IL)-17 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the ASTA pretreatment group were significantly decreased, while the content of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and the percentage of Treg cells were significantly increased. Western blot analysis showed that ASTA could up-regulate the expression level of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) and down-regulate the expression levels of phosphorylated Janus kinase 2 (p-JAK2), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) in lung tissue. The results showed that ASTA had a protective effect on LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, and its protective mechanism was through activating the SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting Treg cell differentiation and reducing inflammatory reactions and Th17 cell differentiation, which provided a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cirsilineol Treatment Attenuates PM2.5-Induced Lung Injury in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36430427/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafine particulate matter with less than 2.5 μm diameter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) is an air pollutant that causes severe lung damage. Currently, effective treatment and preventive methods for PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung damage are limited. Cirsilineol (CSL) is a small natural compound isolated from Artemisia vestita. In this study, the efficacy of CSL on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung toxicity was tested, and its mechanism was identified. Lung injury was caused by intratracheal administration of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; suspension in animal models. Two days after PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; pretreatment, CSL was injected via mouse tail vein for two days. The effects of CSL on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung damage, autophagy, apoptosis, and pulmonary inflammation in a mouse model and their mechanisms were investigated. CSL significantly suppressed histological lung damage and lung wet/dry weight proportion. CSL also significantly reduced PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced autophagy dysfunction, apoptosis, lymphocyte suppression, and inflammatory cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF). Furthermore, CSL increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation and significantly inhibited the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, MyD88, and the autophagy proteins, Beclin1 and LC3II. Thus, CSL exerts protective effects on pulmonary damage by regulating mTOR and TLR2,4–myD88 autophagy pathways. Therefore, CSL can be used as an effective treatment for PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance: Xuebijing injection is a Chinese herbal-derived drug composed of radix paeoniaerubra, rhizomachuanxiong, Salvia miltiorrhiza, floscarthami, and Angelica sinensis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Xuebijing administration on pulmonary endothelial injury and coagulation dysfunction in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis rat model. Materials and methods: A CLP-induced sepsis rat model was established. The CLP rats were treated with a vehicle or Xuebijing via intravenous infusion and sacrificed at 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 h after CLP for lung tissue and blood sample collection. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was monitored. Transmission microscopy examination and H&amp;amp;E staining were performed to observe pulmonary structural alterations. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the plasma levels of epithelial markers, proinflammatory cytokines, and coagulation-related proteins. Results: Compared with vehicle treatment, Xuebijing administration maintained the MAP in the normal range until 11 h after CLP. Transmission microscopy and H&amp;amp;E staining revealed that Xuebijing administration alleviated alveolar–capillary barrier impairments and lung inflammation in CLP rats. ELISA showed that Xuebijing administration effectively reversed CLP-induced elevations in the plasma levels of epithelial markers endothelin-1 and von Willebrand factor, starting 6 and 8 h after CLP, respectively. Xuebijing administration also significantly abolished CLP-induced rises in circulating proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) at 6 h after CLP, IL-1β at 2 and 12 h after CLP, and TNF-α at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after CLP. In addition, Xuebijing administration strongly reversed CLP-induced alterations in circulating active protein C and tissue-type plasminogen activator, starting 4 h and 2 h after CLP, respectively. Conclusions: Xuebijing ameliorates pulmonary endothelial injury, systemic inflammation, and coagulation dysfunction in early sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organ Crosstalk in Acute Kidney Injury: Evidence and Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36431113/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is becoming a public health problem worldwide. AKI is usually considered a complication of lung, heart, liver, gut, and brain disease, but recent findings have supported that injured kidney can also cause dysfunction of other organs, suggesting organ crosstalk existence in AKI. However, the organ crosstalk in AKI and the underlying mechanisms have not been broadly reviewed or fully investigated. In this review, we summarize recent clinical and laboratory findings of organ crosstalk in AKI and highlight the related molecular mechanisms. Moreover, their crosstalk involves inflammatory and immune responses, hemodynamic change, fluid homeostasis, hormone secretion, nerve reflex regulation, uremic toxin, and oxidative stress. Our review provides important clues for the intervention for AKI and investigates important therapeutic potential from a new perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Xuanfei Baidu formula alleviates impaired mitochondrial dynamics and activated NLRP3 inflammasome by repressing NF-κB and MAPK pathways in LPS-induced ALI and inflammation models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36423572/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36423572/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xuanfei Baidu Formula (XBF) is an effective traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) remedy for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. This herbal medicine has shown effects in reducing clinical symptoms and shortening the average length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that XBF alleviates acute lung injury (ALI) by regulating macrophage-mediated immune inflammation, but the mechanisms of action remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to evaluate the lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of XBF and its underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, XBF&amp;rsquo;s effects were investigated in an ALI mouse model induced by inhalation of atomized lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Besides, the LPS-induced inflammation model in RAW264.7 cells was used to clarify the underlying mechanisms of XBF against ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results showed that XBF treatment alleviated LPS-induced lung injury, as evidenced by reduced histopathological changes, pulmonary alveoli permeability, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the lung tissues. In addition, inflammation was alleviated as shown by decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and reduced white blood cell (WBC) count in BALF. Furthermore, consistent with the in vivo assay, XBF inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines release and pro-inflammatory polarization in RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, XBF increased mitochondrial fusion by upregulating Mfn1 and attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by repressing Casp11, respectively, to inhibit NF-κB and MAPK pathways, thus repressing pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we demonstrate that XBF exerts anti-ALI and -inflammatory effects by recovering mitochondrial dynamics and reducing inflammasome activation, providing a biological illustration of the clinical efficacy of XBF in treating COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beneficial effects of CCL8 inhibition at lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36404927/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CCL8 (MCP-2) is a chemoattractive cytokine associated with various immune-related pathologies. Recent studies show that CCL8 is significantly stimulated during acute respiratory distress syndrome in severely ill patients with COVID-19, making the inhibition of CCL8 activity a promising treatment. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury was evaluated in mice using a neutralizing antibody (1G3E5) against human CCL8. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that following IP administration, 1G3E5 was sustained at higher levels and for a longer period compared to IV administration. CCL8 expression in the lungs was not enhanced by LPS, but CCR2 and CCR5 receptors were significantly stimulated. 1G3E5-mediated inhibition of CCL8 was associated with the reduction of pulmonary inflammation and suppression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results point to a previously unrecognized, permissive role for CCL8 in mediating cytokine induction and ultimately sustaining inflammation. Disruption of CCL8 activity may provide a strategy for mitigating pulmonary inflammation during lung injury when related to abnormal cytokine induction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blocking MG53S255 Phosphorylation Protects Diabetic Heart From Ischemic Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36337049/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36337049/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; As an integral component of cell membrane repair machinery, MG53 (mitsugumin 53) is important for cardioprotection induced by ischemia preconditioning and postconditioning. However, it also impairs insulin signaling via its E3 ligase activity-mediated ubiquitination-dependent degradation of IR (insulin receptor) and IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) and its myokine function-induced allosteric blockage of IR. Here, we sought to develop MG53 into a cardioprotection therapy by separating its detrimental metabolic effects from beneficial actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, site-specific mutation, in vitro kinase assay, and in vivo animal studies, we investigated the role of MG53 phosphorylation at serine 255 (S255). In particular, utilizing recombinant proteins and gene knock-in approaches, we evaluated the potential therapeutic effect of MG53-S255A mutant in treating cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury in diabetic mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We identified S255 phosphorylation as a prerequisite for MG53 E3 ligase activity. Furthermore, MG53S255 phosphorylation was mediated by GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) and markedly elevated in the animal models with metabolic disorders. Thus, IR-IRS1-GSK3β-MG53 formed a vicious cycle in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders where aberrant insulin signaling led to hyper-activation of GSK3β, which in turn, phosphorylated MG53 and enhanced its E3 ligase activity, and further impaired insulin sensitivity. Importantly, S255A mutant eliminated the E3 ligase activity while retained cell protective function of MG53. Consequently, the S255A mutant, but not the wild type MG53, protected the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury in db/db mice with advanced diabetes, although both elicited cardioprotection in normal mice. Moreover, in S255A knock-in mice, S255A mutant also mitigated ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial damage in the diabetic setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; S255 phosphorylation is a biased regulation of MG53 E3 ligase activity. The MG53-S255A mutant provides a promising approach for the treatment of acute myocardial injury, especially in patients with metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and Rab GTPases coordinate EGFR trafficking to regulate macrophage activation in sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36344490/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EGFR phosphorylation is required for TLR4-mediated macrophage activation during sepsis. However, whether and how intracellular EGFR is transported during endotoxemia have largely been unknown. Here, we show that LPS promotes high levels cell surface expression of EGFR in macrophages through two different transport mechanisms. On one hand, Rab10 is required for EEA1-mediated the membrane translocation of EGFR from the Golgi. On the other hand, EGFR phosphorylation prevents its endocytosis in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced membrane EGFR expression in LPS-activated macrophage. Mechanistically, upon LPS induced TLR4/EGFR phosphorylation, MAPK14 phosphorylated Rab7a at S72 impaired membrane receptor late endocytosis, which maintains EGFR membrane localization though blocking its lysosomal degradation. Meanwhile, Rab5a is also involved in the early endocytosis of EGFR. Subsequently, inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation switches M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype and alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury. Mechanistic study demonstrated that Erlotinib suppressed glycolysis-dependent M1 polarization via PKM2/HIF-1ɑ pathway and promoted M2 polarization through up-regulating PPARγ induced glutamine metabolism. Collectively, our data elucidated a more in-depth mechanism of macrophages activation, and provided stronger evidence supporting EGFR as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dusp6 deficiency attenuates neutrophil-mediated cardiac damage in the acute inflammatory phase of myocardial infarction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36335128/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) serves a specific and conserved function on the dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). We previously identified Dusp6 as a regenerative repressor during zebrafish heart regeneration, therefore we propose to investigate the role of this repressor in mammalian cardiac repair. Utilizing a rat strain harboring Dusp6 nonsense mutation, rat neutrophil-cardiomyocyte co-culture, bone marrow transplanted rats and neutrophil-specific Dusp6 knockout mice, we find that Dusp6 deficiency improves cardiac outcomes by predominantly attenuating neutrophil-mediated myocardial damage in acute inflammatory phase after myocardial infarction. Mechanistically, Dusp6 is transcriptionally activated by p38-C/EBPβ signaling and acts as an effector for maintaining p-p38 activity by down-regulating pERK and p38-targeting phosphatases DUSP1/DUSP16. Our findings provide robust animal models and novel insights for neutrophil-mediated cardiac damage and demonstrate the potential of DUSP6 as a therapeutic target for post-MI cardiac remodeling and other relevant inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GLI1&#43; cells are a source of repair-supportive mesenchymal cells (RSMCs) during airway epithelial regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36333491/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repair-supportive mesenchymal cells (RSMCs) have been recently reported in the context of naphthalene (NA)-induced airway injury and regeneration. These cells transiently express smooth muscle actin (&lt;em&gt;Acta2&lt;/em&gt;) and are enriched with platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (&lt;em&gt;Pdgfra&lt;/em&gt;) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (&lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt;) expression. Genetic deletion of Ctnnb1 (gene coding for beta catenin) or &lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt; in these cells using the &lt;em&gt;Acta2-Cre-ERT2&lt;/em&gt; driver line after injury (defined as NA-Tam condition; Tam refers to tamoxifen) led to impaired repair of the airway epithelium. In this study, we demonstrate that RSMCs are mostly captured using the &lt;em&gt;Acta2-Cre-ERT2&lt;/em&gt; driver when labeling occurs after (NA-Tam condition) rather than before injury (Tam-NA condition), and that their expansion occurs mostly between days 3 and 7 following NA treatment. Previous studies have shown that lineage-traced peribronchial GLI1+ cells are transiently amplified after NA injury. Here, we report that &lt;em&gt;Gli1&lt;/em&gt; expression is enriched in RSMCs. Using lineage tracing with Gli1&lt;sup&gt;Cre-ERT2&lt;/sup&gt; mice combined with genetic inactivation of &lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt;, we show that GLI1+ cells with &lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt; deletion fail to amplify around the injured airways, thus resulting in impaired airway epithelial repair. Interestingly, &lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt; expression is not upregulated in GLI1+ cells following NA treatment, suggesting that epithelial repair is mostly due to the increased number of &lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt;-expressing GLI1+ cells. Co-culture of SCGB1A1+ cells with GLI1+ cells isolated from non-injured or injured lungs showed that GLI1+ cells from these two conditions are similarly capable of supporting bronchiolar organoid (or bronchiolosphere) formation. Single-cell RNA sequencing on sorted lineage-labeled cells showed that the RSMC signature resembles that of alveolar fibroblasts. Altogether, our study provides strong evidence for the involvement of mesenchymal progenitors in airway epithelial regeneration and highlights the critical role played by &lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt;-expressing GLI1+ cells in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblast growth factor 10 protects against particulate matter-induced lung injury by inhibiting oxidative stress-mediated pyroptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36461597/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulate matter (PM) is a major environmental contaminant that causes and worsens respiratory diseases. Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10), a paracrine fibroblast growth factor that specifically stimulates repair and regeneration after injury, has been shown to protect against PM-induced lung injury. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, the protective effects of FGF10 were investigated using a PM-induced lung injury mouse model in vivo and BEAS-2B cells in vitro. According to the findings, FGF10 treatment alleviated PM-induced oxidative damage and pyroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, FGF10 activated antioxidative Nrf2 signaling. Inhibition of PI3K signaling with LY294002 or Nrf2 signaling with ML385 revealed that FGF10-mediated lung protection was mediated by the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. These results collectively indicate that FGF10 inhibits oxidative stress-mediated pyroptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway, suggesting a possible therapy for PM-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bacterial polyphosphates induce CXCL4 and synergize with complement anaphylatoxin C5a in lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36405694/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyphosphates are linear polymers of inorganic phosphates that exist in all living cells and serve pleiotropic functions. Bacteria produce long-chain polyphosphates, which can interfere with host defense to infection. In contrast, short-chain polyphosphates are released from platelet dense granules and bind to the chemokine CXCL4. Here, we report that long-chain polyphosphates induced the release of CXCL4 from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages in a dose-/time-dependent fashion resulting from an induction of CXCL4 mRNA. This polyphosphate effect was lost after pre-incubation with recombinant exopolyphosphatase (PPX) Fc fusion protein, demonstrating the potency of long chains over monophosphates and ambient cations. In detail, polyphosphate chains &amp;gt;70 inorganic phosphate residues were required to reliably induce CXCL4. Polyphosphates acted independently of the purinergic P2Y1 receptor and the MyD88/TRIF adaptors of Toll-like receptors. On the other hand, polyphosphates augmented LPS/MyD88-induced CXCL4 release, which was explained by intracellular signaling convergence on PI3K/Akt. Polyphosphates induced Akt phosphorylation at threonine-308. Pharmacologic blockade of PI3K (wortmannin, LY294002) antagonized polyphosphate-induced CXCL4 release from macrophages. Intratracheal polyphosphate administration to C57BL/6J mice caused histologic signs of lung injury, disruption of the endothelial-epithelial barrier, influx of Ly6G&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; polymorphonuclear neutrophils, depletion of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;SiglecF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; alveolar macrophages, and release of CXCL4. Long-chain polyphosphates synergized with the complement anaphylatoxin, C5a, which was partly explained by upregulation of C5aR1 on myeloid cells. C5aR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice were protected from polyphosphate-induced lung injury. C5a generation occurred in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of polyphosphate-treated C57BL/6J mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate that polyphosphates govern immunomodulation in macrophages and promote acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe form of lung inflammation causing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients. ALI pathogenesis is closely linked to uncontrolled alveolar inflammation. We hypothesize that specific enzymes of the glycolytic pathway could function as key regulators of alveolar inflammation. Therefore, we screened isolated alveolar epithelia from mice exposed to ALI induced by injurious ventilation to assess their metabolic responses. These studies pointed us toward a selective role for isoform 3 of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3). Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of Pfkfb3 in alveolar epithelia (Pfkfb3loxP/loxP SPC-ER-Cre+ mice) was associated with profound increases in ALI during injurious mechanical ventilation or acid instillation. Studies in genetic models linked Pfkfb3 expression and function to Hif1a. Not only did intratracheal pyruvate instillation reconstitute Pfkfb3loxP/loxP or Hif1aloxP/loxP SPC-ER-Cre+ mice, but pyruvate was also effective in ALI treatment of wild-type mice. Finally, proof-of-principle studies in human lung biopsies demonstrated increased PFKFB3 staining in injured lungs and colocalized PFKFB3 to alveolar epithelia. These studies reveal a specific role for PFKFB3 in counterbalancing alveolar inflammation and lay the groundwork for novel metabolic therapeutic approaches during ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ibrutinib Prevents Acute Lung Injury via Multi-Targeting BTK, FLT3 and EGFR in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36362264/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibrutinib has potential therapeutic or protective effects against viral- and bacterial-induced acute lung injury (ALI), likely by modulating the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling pathway. However, ibrutinib has multi-target effects. Moreover, immunity and inflammation targets in ALI treatment are poorly defined. We investigated whether the BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related signaling pathways mediated the protective effects of ibrutinib on ALI. The intratracheal administration of poly I:C or LPS after ibrutinib administration in mice was performed by gavage. The pathological conditions of the lungs were assessed by micro-CT and HE staining. The levels of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and related inflammatory factors in the lungs were evaluated by ELISA, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. Finally, the expression of proteins associated with the BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related signaling pathways were evaluated by Western blotting. Ibrutinib (10 mg/kg) protected against poly I:C-induced (5 mg/kg) and LPS-induced (5 mg/kg) lung inflammation. The wet/dry weight ratio (W/D) and total proteins in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were markedly reduced after ibrutinib (10 mg/kg) treatment, relative to the poly I:C- and LPS-treated groups. The levels of ALI indicators (NFκB, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) were significantly reduced after treatment. Accordingly, ibrutinib inhibited the poly I:C- and LPS-induced BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related pathway activations. Ibrutinib inhibited poly I:C- and LPS-induced acute lung injury, and this may be due to its ability to suppress the BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related signaling pathways. Therefore, ibrutinib is a potential protective agent for regulating immunity and inflammation in poly I:C- and LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrating bulk and single-cell sequencing reveals the phenotype-associated cell subpopulations in sepsis-induced acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dysfunctional immune response and multiple organ injury in sepsis is a recurrent theme impacting prognosis and mortality, while the lung is the first organ invaded by sepsis. To systematically elucidate the transcriptomic changes in the main constituent cells of sepsis-injured lung tissue, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to the lung tissue samples from septic and control mice and created a comprehensive cellular landscape with 25044 cells, including 11317 immune and 13727 non-immune cells. Sepsis alters the composition of all cellular compartments, particularly neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, endothelial, and fibroblasts populations. Our study firstly provides a single-cell view of cellular changes in septic lung injury. Furthermore, by integrating bulk sequencing data and single-cell data with the Scissors-method, we identified the cell subpopulations that are most associated with septic lung injury phenotype. The phenotypic-related cell subpopulations identified by Scissors-method were consistent with the cell subpopulations with significant composition changes. The function analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the cell-cell interaction analysis further reveal the important role of these phenotype-related subpopulations in septic lung injury. Our research provides a rich resource for understanding cellular changes and provides insights into the contributions of specific cell types to the biological processes that take place during sepsis-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mefunidone ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury through inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway and enhancing Nrf2 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36334370/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary edema and hyperemia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary structure disorder, inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone reduces reactive oxygen species generation through increasing expression of nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and objective:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease which has high mortality and lacks effective pharmacological treatments. Excessive inflammation and oxidative stress are the key pathogenesis of ALI. Mefunidone (MFD), a novel small molecule compound, displayed anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress effects on streptozocin (STZ) and db/db mice in our previous studies. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of MFD on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and explore the potential molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the effects of MFD on LPS-induced ALI mouse model and LPS-stimulated immortalized mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MFD could alleviate pulmonary structure disorder and attenuate pulmonary neutrophils infiltration induced by LPS. MFD could also decreased proinflammatory cytokines release and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation stimulated by LPS. Further, MFD could significantly reduce LPS-induced phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), increase expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and restore the expressions of antioxidant enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results firstly supported that MFD effectively protected LPS-induced ALI against inflammation and oxidative stress through inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway and activating Nrf2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of Isolated and Combined Exposure of the Brain and Lungs to a Laser-Induced Shock Wave(s) on Physiological and Neurological Responses in Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35652331/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) has been suggested to be caused by direct head exposure and by torso exposure to a shock wave (thoracic hypotheses). It is unclear, however, how torso exposure affects the brain in real time. This study applied a mild-impulse laser-induced shock wave(s) (LISW[s]) only to the brain (Group 1), lungs (Group 2), or to the brain and lungs (Group 3) in rats. Because LISWs are unaccompanied by a dynamic pressure in principle, the effects of acceleration can be excluded, allowing analysis of the pure primary mechanism (the effects of a shock wave). For all rat groups, real-time monitoring of the brain and systemic responses were conducted for up to 1 h post-exposure and motor function assessments for up to seven days post-exposure. As reported previously, brain exposure alone caused cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), followed by long-lasting hypoxemia and oligemia in the cortices (Group 1). It was found that even LISW application only to the lungs caused prolonged hypoxemia and mitochondrial dysfunction in the cortices (Group 2). Importantly, features of CSD and mitochondrial dysfunction were significantly exacerbated by combined exposure (Group 3) compared with those caused by brain exposure alone (Group 1). Motor dysfunction was observed in all exposure groups, but their time courses differed depending on the groups. Rats with brain exposure alone exhibited the most evident motor dysfunction at one day post-exposure, and after that, it did not change much for up to seven days post-exposure. Alternatively, two groups of rats with lung exposure (Group 2 and Group 3) exhibited continuously aggravated motor functions for up to seven days post-exposure, suggesting different mechanisms for motor dysfunction caused by brain exposure and that caused by lung exposure. As for the reported thoracic hypotheses, our observations seem to support the volumetric blood surge and vagovagal reflex. Overall, the results of this study indicate the importance of the torso guard to protect the brain and its function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles in the pathogenesis and treatment of acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36316787/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are common life-threatening lung diseases associated with acute and severe inflammation. Both have high mortality rates, and despite decades of research on clinical ALI/ARDS, there are no effective therapeutic strategies. Disruption of alveolar-capillary barrier integrity or activation of inflammatory responses leads to lung inflammation and injury. Recently, studies on the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in regulating normal and pathophysiologic cell activities, including inflammation and injury responses, have attracted attention. Injured and dysfunctional cells often secrete EVs into serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with altered cargoes, which can be used to diagnose and predict the development of ALI/ARDS. EVs secreted by mesenchymal stem cells can also attenuate inflammatory reactions associated with cell dysfunction and injury to preserve or restore cell function, and thereby promote cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. This review focuses on the roles of EVs in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation, particularly ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNA circBNC2 inhibits epithelial cell G2-M arrest to prevent fibrotic maladaptive repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36316334/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms underlying fibrogenic responses after injury are not well understood. Epithelial cell cycle arrest in G2/M after injury is a key checkpoint for determining wound-healing leading to either normal cell proliferation or fibrosis. Here, we identify a kidney- and liver-enriched circular RNA, circBNC2, which is abundantly expressed in normal renal tubular cells and hepatocytes but significantly downregulated after acute ischemic or toxic insult. Loss of circBNC2 is at least partially mediated by upregulation of DHX9. Gain- and loss-of-function studies, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrate that circBNC2 acts as a negative regulator of cell G2/M arrest by encoding a protein that promotes formation of CDK1/cyclin B1 complexes. Restoring circBNC2 in experimentally-induced male mouse models of fibrotic kidney and liver, decreases G2/M arrested cell numbers with secretion of fibrotic factors, thereby mitigating extracellular matrix deposition and fibrosis. Decreased expression of circBNC2 and increased G2/M arrest of epithelial cells are recapitulated in human ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced chronic kidney disease and inflammation-induced liver fibrosis, highlighting the clinical relevance. These findings suggest that restoring circBNC2 might represent a potential strategy for therapeutic intervention in epithelial organ fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles attenuate tPA-induced blood-brain barrier disruption in murine ischemic stroke models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36367475/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage following blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption resulting from thrombolysis of ischemic stroke with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) remains a critical clinical problem. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are promising nanotherapeutic agents that have the potential to repair the BBB after ischemic stroke; however, whether they can attenuate BBB disruption and hemorrhagic transformation after tPA thrombolysis is largely unknown. Here, we observed that MSC-EVs efficiently passed through the BBB and selectively accumulated in injured brain regions in ischemic stroke model mice in real time using aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), which exhibit better tracking ability than the commercially available tracer DiR. Moreover, tPA administration promoted the homing of MSC-EVs to the ischemic brain and increased the uptake of MSC-EVs by astrocytes. Furthermore, the accumulated MSC-EVs attenuated the tPA-induced disruption of BBB integrity and alleviated hemorrhage by inhibiting astrocyte activation and inflammation. Mechanistically, miR-125b-5p delivered by MSC-EVs played an indispensable role in maintaining BBB integrity by targeting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and inhibiting nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling in astrocytes. This study provides a noninvasive method for real-time tracking of MSC-EVs in the ischemic brain after tPA treatment and highlights the potential of MSC-EVs as thrombolytic adjuvants for ischemic stroke. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Although tPA thrombolysis is the most effective pharmaceutical strategy for acute ischemic stroke, its clinical application and therapeutic efficacy are challenged by tPA-induced BBB disruption and hemorrhagic transformation. Our study demonstrated that MSC-EVs can act as an attractive thrombolytic adjuvant to repair the BBB and improve thrombolysis in a mouse ischemic stroke model. Notably, by labeling MSC-EVs with AIEgens, we achieved accurate real-time imaging of MSC-EVs in the ischemic brain and therapeutic visualization. MSC-EVs inhibit astrocyte activation and associated inflammation through miR-125b-5p/TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Consequently, we revealed that MSC-EVs combined with tPA thrombolysis may be a promising approach for the treatment of ischemic stroke in clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure to Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; causes an inflammatory reaction and fibrosis in lung tissue of mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increases H19 and TNFRSF1A levels, decreases miR-29a-3p levels, and activates the NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells and mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;H19 via miR-29a-3p-regulated TNFRSF1A is involved in Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study provide a tool for assessing lung injury risk of Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and other environmental factors that induce inflammatory response and pulmonary fibrosis-associated lncRNAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The occupational and environmental health safety of rare earths has attracted considerable attention. In China, the rare earth neodymium oxide (Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is extensively refined and utilized. However, the mechanisms of Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury are elusive. In the present study, we found that exposure of mice to Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; caused an inflammatory reaction and fibrosis in lung tissues, which was in relation to the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced higher levels of the lncRNA H19 (H19), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFRSF1A), p-p65, and p-IKKβ and lower levels of miR-29a-3p. Further, in mouse monocyte macrophage leukemia cells (RAW264.7), Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; induced an inflammatory reaction, increases of H19 and TNFRSF1A levels, decreases of miR-29a-3p levels, and activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway. Further, we established that miR-29a-3p regulates TNFRSF1A expression. Up-regulation of miR-29a-3p and down-regulation of H19 blocked the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced secretion of TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-6; the increases of TNFRSF1A levels; and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells. Further, in Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-treated RAW26.4 cells, H19 inhibited the expression of miR-29a-3p, which targets TNFRSF1A, and activated the NF-κB signaling pathway to enhance the expression of TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-6. Moreover, for mice, up-regulation of miR-29a-3p reversed lung tissue inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway induced by Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In sum, the present investigation shows that H19 via miR-29a-3p is involved in lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis induced by Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a mechanism for the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung inflammatory response and pulmonary fibrosis. This information is useful for development of a biomarker of Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Drug-induced interstitial lung disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interstitial lung disease (ILD) secondary to drug-induced lung injury is an increasingly common cause of morbidity and mortality. The number of drugs associated with the development of ILD continues to rise, mainly due to the use of novel monoclonal antibodies and biologicals for neoplastic and rheumatological diseases, and includes, among others, chemotherapeutics, molecular targeting agents, immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibiotics, antiarrhythmics and conventional or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Drug-induced ILD (DI-ILD) manifests with a variety of clinical patterns, ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to rapidly progressive respiratory failure and death. In most cases, there are no pathognomonic clinical, laboratory, radiological or pathological features and the diagnosis of DI-ILD is suspected in the presence of exposure to a drug known to cause lung toxicity and after exclusion of alternative causes of ILD. Early identification and permanent discontinuation of the culprit drug are the cornerstones of treatment with systemic glucocorticoids being used in patients with disabling or progressive disease. However, for certain drugs, such as checkpoint inhibitors, the frequency of lung toxicity is such that mitigation strategies are put in place to prevent this complication, and occurrence of DI-ILD is not necessarily synonymous with permanent drug discontinuation, particularly in the absence of valid therapeutic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long-Term Dietary Lycium ruthenicum Murr. Anthocyanins Intake Alleviated Oxidative Stress-Mediated Aging-Related Liver Injury and Abnormal Amino Acid Metabolism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the relationship between Lycium ruthenicum Murr. anthocyanins (LRA) and health has attracted increasing attention. The purpose of this study is to investigate the anti-aging effect and mechanism of LRA through a D-galactose (DG)-induced aging rat model. Our results showed that the long-term intake of LRA, for 8 weeks, improved motor function, reduced serum aging markers, promoted the endogenous antioxidant system, and suppressed the serum inflammatory cytokines in aging rats. Besides, the LRA treatment alleviated DG-induced liver injuries by relieving the inflammation and inhibiting Fas/FasL-mediated cell death. More importantly, the abnormal serum metabolome profiles of the aging rats were restored by the LRA, relating to 38 metabolites and 44 pathways. Specifically, the LRA significantly affected the amino acid and protein-related metabolic pathways by regulating the levels of L-threonine, L-aspartic acid, glycine, L-histidine, D-homocysteine, L-homocitrulline, L-homoserine, guanidineacetic acid, and kynurenine. These results have important implications for the development of LRA as an anti-aging and liver-protective ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salt-inducible kinase 2 regulates fibrosis during bleomycin-induced lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and normally fatal disease with limited treatment options. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib has recently been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and its effectiveness has been linked to its ability to inhibit a number of receptor tyrosine kinases including the platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor receptors. We show here that nintedanib also inhibits salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2), with a similar IC50 to its reported tyrosine kinase targets. Nintedanib also inhibited the related kinases SIK1 and SIK3, although with 12-fold and 72-fold higher IC50s, respectively. To investigate if the inhibition of SIK2 may contribute to the effectiveness of nintedanib in treating lung fibrosis, mice with kinase-inactive knockin mutations were tested using a model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. We found that loss of SIK2 activity protects against bleomycin-induced fibrosis, as judged by collagen deposition and histological scoring. Loss of both SIK1 and SIK2 activity had a similar effect to loss of SIK2 activity. Total SIK3 knockout mice have a developmental phenotype making them unsuitable for analysis in this model; however, we determined that conditional knockout of SIK3 in the immune system did not affect bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Together, these results suggest that SIK2 is a potential drug target for the treatment of lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bclaf1 regulates c-FLIP expression and protects cells from TNF-induced apoptosis and tissue injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TNF stimulation generates pro-survival signals through activation of NF-κB that restrict the build-in death signaling triggered by TNF. The competition between TNF-induced survival and death signals ultimately determines the fate of a cell. Here, we report the identification of Bclaf1 as a novel component of the anti-apoptotic program of TNF. Bclaf1 depletion in multiple cells sensitizes cells to TNF-induced apoptosis but not to necroptosis. Bclaf1 exerts its anti-apoptotic function by promoting the transcription of CFLAR, a caspase 8 antagonist, downstream of NF-κB activation. Bclaf1 binds to the p50 subunit of NF-κB, which is required for Bclaf1 to stimulate CFLAR transcription. Finally, in Bclaf1 siRNA administered mice, TNF-induced small intestine injury is much more severe than in control mice with aggravated signs of apoptosis and pyroptosis. These results suggest Bclaf1 is a key regulator in TNF-induced apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Naringenin attenuates inflammation, apoptosis, and ferroptosis in silver nanoparticle-induced lung injury through a mechanism associated with Nrf2/HO-1 axis: In vitro and in vivo studies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36306867/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the wide application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), their potential damage to human health needs to be investigated. Lung is one of the main target organs after inhalation of AgNPs. Naringenin has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of naringenin against AgNPs-induced lung injury and determine the underlying mechanism. In in vivo experiments, AgNPs were intratracheally instilled into ICR mice (l mg/kg) to establish a lung injury model. These mice were then treated with naringenin by oral gavage (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) for three days. Naringenin treatment decreased the levels of white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in the blood, ameliorated lung injury, suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, normalized ferroptotic markers and prevented oxidative stress with elevating Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expressions in lung. In in vitro experiments, BEAS-2B cells were firstly treated with AgNPs (320 μg/mL) and then naringenin (25, 50, and 100 μM), respectively. Naringenin attenuated AgNPs-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Moreover, naringenin attenuated AgNPs-induced apoptosis with modulated low BAX, CytC, cleaved Caspase9, cleaved Caspase3 but high Bcl2. Furthermore, naringenin effectively decreased ferroptotic markers and increased the protein expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1, as well as increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Importantly, the anti-apoptotic and anti-ferroptotic effects of naringenin in BEAS-2B cells were found to be at least partially Nrf2-dependent. These results indicated that naringenin exerted anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and anti-ferroptosis effects and protected against AgNPs-induced lung injury at least partly via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Translation Rescue by Targeting Ppp1r15a through Its Upstream Open Reading Frame in Sepsis-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in a Murine Model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36283811/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36283811/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Translation shutdown is a hallmark of late-phase, sepsis-induced kidney injury. Methods for controlling protein synthesis in the kidney are limited. Reversing translation shutdown requires dephosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) subunit eIF2α; this is mediated by a key regulatory molecule, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A (Ppp1r15a), also known as GADD34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To study protein synthesis in the kidney in a murine endotoxemia model and investigate the feasibility of translation control &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; by boosting the protein expression of Ppp1r15a, we combined multiple tools, including ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), proteomics, polyribosome profiling, and antisense oligonucleotides, and a newly generated Ppp1r15a knock-in mouse model and multiple mutant cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We report that translation shutdown in established sepsis-induced kidney injury is brought about by excessive eIF2α phosphorylation and sustained by blunted expression of the counter-regulatory phosphatase Ppp1r15a. We determined the blunted Ppp1r15a expression persists because of the presence of an upstream open reading frame (uORF). Overcoming this barrier with genetic and antisense oligonucleotide approaches enabled the overexpression of Ppp1r15a, which salvaged translation and improved kidney function in an endotoxemia model. Loss of this uORF also had broad effects on the composition and phosphorylation status of the immunopeptidome-peptides associated with the MHC-that extended beyond the eIF2α axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We found Ppp1r15a is translationally repressed during late-phase sepsis because of the existence of an uORF, which is a prime therapeutic candidate for this strategic rescue of translation in late-phase sepsis. The ability to accurately control translation dynamics during sepsis may offer new paths for the development of therapies at codon-level precision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macrophage Sprouty4 deficiency diminishes sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36334381/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation and oxidative stress play critical roles in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Sprout4 (Spry4) is involved in regulating inflammation and tissue injury; however, its role and mechanism in sepsis-induced ALI remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Macrophage-specific Spry4 knockout (Spry4&lt;sup&gt;MKO&lt;/sup&gt;), transgenic (Spry4&lt;sup&gt;MTG&lt;/sup&gt;) mice and matched control littermates were generated and exposed to cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery to establish bacterial sepsis-induced ALI. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Spry4MKO or Spry4&lt;sup&gt;MTG&lt;/sup&gt; mice were isolated and subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation to further validate the role of Spry4 in vitro. To verify the necessity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Spry4 and AMPK double knockout mice and compound C were used in vivo and in vitro. BMDMs were treated with STO-609 to inhibit calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that macrophage Spry4 was increased in CLP mice and positively correlated with sepsis-induced ALI. Macrophage Spry4 deficiency prevented, while macrophage Spry4 overexpression exacerbated sepsis-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and ALI in mice and BMDMs. Mechanistic studies revealed that macrophage Spry4 deficiency alleviated sepsis-induced ALI through activating CaMKK2/AMPK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study identify macrophage Spry4 as a promising predictive and therapeutic target of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>After the Storm: Regeneration, Repair, and Reestablishment of Homeostasis Between the Alveolar Epithelium and Innate Immune System Following Viral Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36270292/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian lung has an enormous environmental-epithelial interface that is optimized to accomplish the principal function of the respiratory system, gas exchange. One consequence of evolving such a large surface area is that the lung epithelium is continuously exposed to toxins, irritants, and pathogens. Maintaining homeostasis in this environment requires a delicate balance of cellular signaling between the epithelium and innate immune system. Following injury, the epithelium can be either fully regenerated in form and function or repaired by forming dysplastic scar tissue. In this review, we describe the major mechanisms of damage, regeneration, and repair within the alveolar niche where gas exchange occurs. With a focus on viral infection, we summarize recent work that has established how epithelial proliferation is arrested during infection and how the innate immune system guides its reconstitution during recovery. The consequence of these processes going awry are also considered, with an emphasis on how this will impact postpandemic pulmonary biology and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CLIC4 localizes to mitochondrial-associated membranes and mediates cardioprotection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs) are known to modulate organellar and cellular functions and can subsequently affect pathophysiology including myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Thus, identifying molecular targets in MAMs that regulate the outcome of IR injury will hold a key to efficient therapeutics. Here, we found chloride intracellular channel protein (CLIC4) presence in MAMs of cardiomyocytes and demonstrate its role in modulating ER and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions. In a murine model, loss of CLIC4 increased myocardial infarction and substantially reduced cardiac function after IR injury. CLIC4 null cardiomyocytes showed increased apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction upon hypoxia-reoxygenation injury in comparison to wild-type cardiomyocytes. Overall, our results indicate that MAM-CLIC4 is a key mediator of cellular response to IR injury and therefore may have a potential implication on other pathophysiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histone Lactylation Boosts Reparative Gene Activation Post-Myocardial Infarction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36268709/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation resolution and cardiac repair initiation after myocardial infarction (MI) require timely activation of reparative signals. Histone lactylation confers macrophage homeostatic gene expression signatures via transcriptional regulation. However, the role of histone lactylation in the repair response post-MI remains unclear. We aimed to investigate whether histone lactylation induces reparative gene expression in monocytes early and remotely post-MI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Single-cell transcriptome data indicated that reparative genes were activated early and remotely in bone marrow and circulating monocytes before cardiac recruitment. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining revealed increases in histone lactylation levels, including the previously identified histone H3K18 lactylation in monocyte-macrophages early post-MI. Through joint CUT&amp;amp;Tag and RNA-sequencing analyses, we identified Lrg1, Vegf-a, and IL-10 as histone H3K18 lactylation target genes. The increased modification and expression levels of these target genes post-MI were verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and reverse transcription-qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrated that histone lactylation regulates the anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic dual activities of monocyte-macrophages by facilitating reparative gene transcription and confirmed that histone lactylation favors a reparative environment and improves cardiac function post-MI. Furthermore, we explored the potential positive role of monocyte histone lactylation in reperfused MI. Mechanistically, we provided new evidence that monocytes undergo metabolic reprogramming in the early stage of MI and demonstrated that dysregulated glycolysis and MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter 1)-mediated lactate transport promote histone lactylation. Finally, we revealed the catalytic effect of IL (interleukin)-1β-dependent GCN5 (general control non-depressible 5) recruitment on histone H3K18 lactylation and elucidated its potential role as an upstream regulatory element in the regulation of monocyte histone lactylation and downstream reparative gene expression post-MI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Histone lactylation promotes early remote activation of the reparative transcriptional response in monocytes, which is essential for the establishment of immune homeostasis and timely activation of the cardiac repair process post-MI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is the most common complication of sepsis. Intravenous injection of HUMSCs can regulate the level of circulating endothelial cytokines and alleviate lung injury in juvenile septic rats. In this study, we performed proteomic and phosphorylated proteomic analysis of lung tissue of juvenile septic rats after Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (HUMSCs) intervention for the first time, and screened the potential proteins and pathways of HUMSCs for therapeutic effect. The 4D proteome quantitative technique was used to quantitatively analyze the lung tissues of septic rats 24 hours (3 biological samples) and 24 hours after HUMSCs intervention (3 biological samples). A total of 213 proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins, and 971 phosphorylation sites changed significantly. Based on the public database, we analyzed the functional enrichment of these proteins and phosphorylated proteins. In addition, Tenascin-C may be the key differential protein and ECM receptor interaction pathway may be the main signal pathway by using various algorithms to analyze the protein-protein interaction network. Phosphorylation analysis showed that tight junction pathway was closely related to immune inflammatory reaction, and EGFR interacted most, which may be the key differential phosphorylated protein. Finally, 123 conserved motifs of serine phosphorylation site (pS) and 17 conserved motifs of threonine (pT) phosphorylation sites were identified by motif analysis of phosphorylation sites. Results from proteomics and phosphorylated proteomics, the potential new therapeutic targets of HUMSCs in alleviating lung injury in juvenile septic rats were revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pulmonary delivery of curcumin-loaded glycyrrhizic acid nanoparticles for anti-inflammatory therapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36263591/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disease of the lungs. Curcumin (Cur) shows protective effects in ALI animal models. However, Cur is a hydrophobic drug and its administration into the lungs is inefficient due to its low bioavailability. In this study, glycyrrhizic acid (GA) micelles were produced and evaluated as a carrier of Cur for treatment of ALI. Cur-loaded GA (GA-Cur) nanoparticles were produced using an oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation method. The size and surface charge of the GA-Cur nanoparticles were 159 nm and -23 mV, respectively. In lipopolysaccharide-activated RAW264.7 cells, the GA-Cur nanoparticles decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels more efficiently than GA, Cur, or a simple mixture of GA and Cur (GA + Cur). This suggests that the GA-Cur nanoparticles improved the therapeutic efficiency by enhanced delivery of GA and Cur. GA-Cur inhibited the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κb and induced endogenous heme oxygenase-1 more efficiently than the other treatments. Furthermore, an in vitro toxicity test showed that GA-Cur had little cytotoxicity. In vivo therapeutic effects of GA-Cur were evaluated in ALI mouse models. GA-Cur was administered into the animals by intratracheal instillation. The results showed that GA-Cur reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner and did so more efficiently than GA, Cur, or GA + Cur. Furthermore, the hemolysis and infiltration of monocytes into the lungs were more effectively inhibited by GA-Cur than the other treatments. The data indicate that GA is an efficient carrier of Cur and an anti-inflammatory drug. Owing to their delivery efficiency and safety, GA-Cur nanoparticles will be useful for treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rhein ameliorates septic lung injury and intervenes in macrophage metabolic reprogramming in the inflammatory state by Sirtuin 1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36279970/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein prevented the progression of acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metabolism in sepsis pathological state was changed after Rhein treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein inhibited the over activation of macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein preconditioning up-regulated and activated SIRT1 signal pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is an organ dysfunction syndrome caused by the maladjustment of response to infection. Acute lung injury (ALI) appears the earliest, with urgent onset and limited treatments. Previous pharmacological studies have found that rhein (RH), an active ingredient rich in rhubarb, has multiple pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-infection and metabolic regulation. This research aimed to explore whether RH alleviates septic acute lung injury and probe possible mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the septic ALI mouse model was established by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). LPS-induced RAW264.7 model was selected to further explore the protective mechanism of RH. H&amp;amp;E staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR, and 1H NMR analysis were used to verify the protective effect of RH on ALI &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; RH could relieve pathological lung injury and pulmonary edema, reduce the serum LPS and inhibit inflammatory response in CLP mice. Further studies displayed that RH affected the metabolism &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, with significant changes in serum and lung metabolomics. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; results demonstrated that RH inhibited the expression of inflammatory mediators and factors in macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming and upregulating the expression of Sirtuin 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; RH improved the overall metabolic condition of sepsis mice by up-regulating and activating SIRT1, and inhibited the over activation of macrophages by regulating metabolism. These findings reveal the therapeutic mechanism of RH on sepsis ALI from the perspective of metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BP5 alleviates endotoxemia-induced acute lung injury by activating Nrf2 via dual regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and the Akt (Ser473)/GSK3β (Ser9)/Fyn pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36272670/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress and inflammation play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). Previously, pentapeptide bursopentin (BP5, Cys-Lys-Arg-Val-Tyr) was reported to possess significant antioxidant activity and inhibit lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced NF-κB activation in vitro, whereas little is known about its effects in vivo. In this study, we explored the effects of BP5 on endotoxemia-induced ALI in mice and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our studies revealed that BP5 markedly improved survival and effectively alleviated lung injury by reducing overoxidation and excessive inflammatory response in endotoxemia mice. In LPS-stimulated mouse primary macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells, BP5 also exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties by enhancing Nrf2 activation. Importantly, these beneficial effects were abolished by Nrf2 knockdown. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we performed localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) assays, molecular docking, together with cell-based studies, and found that BP5 inhibited the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction to promote Nrf2 nuclear translocation and activation. Moreover, BP5-induced Nrf2 activation was shown to be accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt (at Ser473) and GSK3β (at Ser9), and a decrease in Fyn nuclear accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacologically inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β obviously enhanced Fyn nuclear accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells, which partially attenuated the promoting effect of BP5 on Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and activation. Furthermore, In Nrf2-/- mice, the protective effects of BP5 on the endotoxemia-induced ALI in WT mice were largely vanished. Our findings indicated that BP5 effectively protected endotoxemia-induced ALI against oxidative stress and inflammatory response, which are largely dependent on activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Underlying mechanisms include dual regulation of the Keap-Nrf2 interaction and the Akt (Ser473)/GSK3β (Ser9)/Fyn pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Memantine nitrate MN-08 suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation to protect against sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 significantly increased the survival rate of septic mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 improved SIRS and immune dysfunction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 attenuated septic lung injury and inflammatory infiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 exerts its protection via suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction with devastating consequences, prominent among which is lung damage. Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, is able to alleviate acute lung injury (ALI). Nitric oxide (NO) suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. MN-08, a novel nitrate derivative of memantine, possesses both the ability to antagonize NMDAR and release NO. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of MN-08 against LPS-induced systemic inflammation and septic lung injury in mice, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of MN-08 in LPS-induced mice and THP-1 macrophages. MN-08 significantly increased the survival rate of septic mice, alleviated LPS-induced sepsis in mice via improving systemic inflammatory response syndrome and immune dysfunction, and attenuated pulmonary injury and inflammatory infiltration. More importantly, the therapeutic benefit of MN-08 for sepsis was greater than that of memantine and dexamethasone. Mechanistically, MN-08 exerted anti-inflammatory activity through inhibiting nuclear translocation of NF-κB, activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and the signaling transduction of STAT3/NF-κB. In addition, MN-08 suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that MN-08 may be a promising therapeutic agent for sepsis-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RNA-Sequencing approach for exploring the therapeutic effect of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem/stromal cells on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36341363/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is significantly associated with morbidity and mortality in patients with critical diseases. In recent years, studies have identified that mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) ameliorate ALI and pulmonary fibrosis. However, the mechanism underlying this outcome in ALI has not yet been investigated. In this study, RNA sequencing technology was used to analyze the gene expression profile of lung tissue in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI rats following treatment with human umbilical cord MSC (HUCMSC). Differential expression analyses, gene ontology annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment, protein-protein interaction network identification, and hub gene analysis were also performed. HUCMSC treatment decreased inflammatory factor production and alveolar exudates, and attenuated lung damage in LPS-induced ALI rats. The RNA-Seq data indicated that HUCMSC treatment activated the IL-17, JAK-STAT, NF-κB, and TNF-α signaling pathways, increased oxygen transport, and decreased extracellular matrix organization. HUCMSC exert beneficial effects on ALI via these signaling pathways by reducing inflammation, inhibiting pulmonary fibrosis, and improving lung ventilation. Moreover, our study further revealed the hub genes (&lt;em&gt;Tbx2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nkx2-1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Atf5&lt;/em&gt;) and signaling pathways involved in HUCMSC treatment, thus providing novel perspectives for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell treatment of ALI. HUCMSC can regulate multiple genes and signaling pathways, which can prevent LPS-induced lung damage in an ALI rat model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A mouse model characterizes the roles of ZIP8 in systemic iron recycling and lung inflammation and infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36260707/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZIP8 knockout mice have elevated spleen iron levels and relative hypoferremia, suggesting that ZIP8 plays a role in iron recycling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While lung ZIP8 is induced with inflammation, ZIP8 deletion in mice had no detrimental effects on acute lung injury or bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZIP8 (SLC39A8) is a transmembrane divalent metal ion importer that is most highly expressed in the lung and is inducible by inflammatory stimuli. In addition to zinc and manganese, ZIP8 can transport iron but its specific roles in iron regulation during homeostatic and pathologic processes remain poorly understood. Using a novel global inducible ZIP8 knockout (KO) mouse, we analyzed the role of ZIP8 in steady-state iron homeostasis and during inflammation and infection. We observed an unexpected phenotype of elevated spleen iron levels and decreased serum iron in ZIP8 KO mice, suggesting that ZIP8 plays a role in iron recycling. We also showed that ZIP8 is expressed on lung distal airspace epithelial cells and transports iron from the airway into lung tissue. LPS-induced inflammation induced ZIP8 expression in the lung, but ZIP8 deletion had no detrimental effect on the severity of LPS-induced acute lung injury or on the outcomes of &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; lung infection. Thus, ZIP8 plays a role in systemic iron homeostasis but does not modulate the severity of inflammatory lung injury or the host defense against a common bacterial cause of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA-VO-ME was successfully prepared with greater bioavailability (214%) than CA-VO in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA-VO-ME reduced the LPS-induced increase in levels of NO, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS and COX-2 in vitro and/or in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA-VO-ME had powerful effect on ameliorating the histopathological changes, prolonging the survival of ALI mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA-VO-ME exerted a better effect on ALI than CA-VO, suggesting that CA-VO-ME is a promising drug for the treatment of ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI), a clinical syndrome of acute respiratory failure due to acute lung inflammation, remains a substantial public health problem in the worldwide. Ligusticum Chuanxiong Rhizoma and Angelicae Sinensis Radix was herb-pair of the traditional Chinese medicine. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that volatile oil extracted from Chuanxiong Rhizome and Angelicae Sinensis Radix is identified as an important active ingredient, which has good antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, whether their volatile oil combination (CA-VO), has effects on the prevention and treatment of ALI has not been reported yet. Due to poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability of CA-VO, CA -VO-loaded microemulsion (CA-VO-ME) was formulated to enhance its oral bioavailability. The physical properties of CA-VO-ME were characterized. The pharmacokinetic parameters and the effect on ALI were evaluated. The particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of CA-VO-ME were 20.19 ± 0.08 nm, 0.091 ± 0.01, 36.33 ± 4.29%, and 93.75%, respectively. CA-VO-ME had a greater bioavailability (214%) than CA-VO. CA-VO-ME reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increase in levels of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in vitro and/or in vivo. Moreover, CA-VO-ME treatment notably decreased the lung index, ameliorated histopathological changes and prolonged the survival of ALI mice. By comparison, CA-VO-ME exerted a better effect on ALI than CA-VO, suggesting that CA-VO-ME is a promising drug for the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

An acute toxicological study was conducted by oral administration of both compounds alone (200, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg) and combined (2000 mg/kg) and their effects on the electron transport chain (ETC) and the ROS production in kidney mitochondria further evaluated. All treatments induced a dose-dependent heart, lung, and kidney injury. However, the intensity of these effects varied according to the substance, with greater cardiac and renal toxicity for EA and pulmonary injury for GA, while the combination attenuated the toxicity of the isolated molecules. All substances inhibited the activity of complexes II, III, and IV of the ETC from renal mitochondria. However, no changes were observed regarding mitochondrial ROS production. These compounds have a non-negligible inherent deleterious potential, so their uncontrolled use at high doses (≥200 mg/kg) could cause undesirable effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of ferroptosis and iron accumulation alleviates pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin model</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive disease characterized by excessive proliferation of fibroblasts and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by the lethal accumulation of iron and lipid peroxidation, which is associated with many diseases. Our study addressed the potential role played by ferroptosis and iron accumulation in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. We found that the inducers of pulmonary fibrosis and injury, namely, bleomycin (BLM) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induced ferroptosis of lung epithelial cells. Both the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1) and the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) alleviated the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin or LPS. TGF-β stimulation upregulated the expression of transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC) in the human lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) and mouse primary lung fibroblasts, resulting in increased intracellular Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which promoted the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Mechanistically, TGF-β enhanced the expression and nuclear localization of the transcriptional coactivator tafazzin (TAZ), which combined with the transcription factor TEA domain protein (TEAD)-4 to promote the transcription of TFRC. In addition, elevated Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; failed to induce the ferroptosis of fibroblasts, which might be related to the regulation of iron export and lipid metabolism. Finally, we specifically knocked out TFRC expression in fibroblasts in mice, and compared with those in the control mice, the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis were reduced in the knockout mice after bleomycin induction. Collectively, these findings suggest the therapeutic potential of ferroptosis inhibitors and iron chelators in treating pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microvascular lung injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress in systemic lupus erythematosus-associated alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary vasculitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36255715/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human &lt;em&gt;COPA&lt;/em&gt; mutations affecting retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein transport cause diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and ER stress (&amp;ldquo;COPA syndrome&amp;rdquo;). Patients with SLE also can develop DAH. C57BL/6 (B6) mice with pristane-induced lupus develop monocyte-dependent DAH indistinguishable from human DAH, whereas BALB/c mice are resistant. We examined Copa and ER stress in pristane-induced lupus. &lt;em&gt;Copa&lt;/em&gt; expression, ER stress, vascular injury, and apoptosis were assessed in mice and &lt;em&gt;COPA&lt;/em&gt; was quantified in blood from patients with SLE. &lt;em&gt;Copa&lt;/em&gt; mRNA and protein expression were impaired in B6 mice with pristane-induced DAH, but not in pristane-treated BALB/c mice. An ER stress response (increased &lt;em&gt;Hsp5a&lt;/em&gt;/BiP, &lt;em&gt;Ddit3&lt;/em&gt;/CHOP, &lt;em&gt;Eif2a&lt;/em&gt;, and spliced &lt;em&gt;Xbp1&lt;/em&gt;) was seen in lungs from pristane-treated B6, but not BALB/c, mice. Resistance of BALB/c mice to DAH was overcome by treating them with low-dose thapsigargin plus pristane. CB6F1 mice did not develop DAH or ER stress, suggesting that susceptibility was recessive. Increased pulmonary expression of von Willebrand factor (&lt;em&gt;Vwf&lt;/em&gt;), a marker of endothelial injury, and the chemokine &lt;em&gt;Ccl2&lt;/em&gt; in DAH suggested that pristane promotes lung microvascular injury and monocyte recruitment. Consistent with that possibility, lung endothelial cells and infiltrating bone marrow-derived cells from pristane-treated B6 mice expressed BiP and showed evidence of apoptosis (annexin-V and activated caspase-3 staining). &lt;em&gt;COPA&lt;/em&gt; expression also was low in patients with SLE with lung involvement. Pristane-induced DAH may be initiated by endothelial injury, resulting in ER stress, apoptosis of lung endothelial cells, and recruitment of myeloid cells that propagate lung injury. The pathogenesis of DAH in SLE and COPA syndrome may overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kidney-Targeted Nanoparticles Loaded with the Natural Antioxidant Rosmarinic Acid for Acute Kidney Injury Treatment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36253133/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical disease with high morbidity and mortality, and with a lack of effective drugs for treatment. Oxidative stress is very important in the occurrence and progression of AKI, and antioxidants use is one of the promising treatments. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a ubiquitous natural polyphenol with powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Due to its inherent characteristic with poor water solubility and inferior bioavailability, its clinical application is impeded. Hence, the authors design a nanoparticle for effectively delivering RA, which is a chemical complex of RA and fourth-generation poly-amidoamine-based amphiphilic polymer (G4-PAMAM). The nanoparticle is modified with l-serine due to the specific interaction between kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) and serine, which eventually generates a promising AKI kidney-targeting nanoparticle (S-G-R). The S-G-R is rapidly cumulated and long-term retained in ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI kidneys, especially in the damaged renal tubular cells. The S-G-R exhibits more excellent antioxidative and antiapoptotic effects in vitro and has a more outstanding ability to improve the renal function, repair damaged renal tissue, and decrease oxidative stress, inflammatory response and apoptosis of tubular cells in vivo. Overall, this study might develop a safe and effective targeting strategy for the therapy of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astaxanthin attenuates ferroptosis via Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways in LPS-induced acute lung injury</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin prevents against LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin attenuates ferroptosis against lps-induced acute lung injury by Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a form of regulated nonapoptotic cell death associated with iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Previous studies have shown that ferroptosis is involved in the occurrence and development of acute lung injury (ALI). In this study, a systems pharmacology approach was performed through the overall process of target acquisition, network construction, and further analysis. Then, the effects of astaxanthin on LPS-induced inflammation and ferroptosis were investigated in RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS in vitro and ALI mice induced by LPS in vivo. The enrichment analysis of astaxanthin-target gene is closely related to the occurrence and development mechanism of ferroptosis. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of astaxanthin acting on ALI found that these intersection genes are associated with ALI inflammatory pathway. In addition, astaxanthin can effectively inhibit LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ferroptosis in RAW264.7 cells. Consistently, administration of astaxanthin protected mice against LPS-induced ALI and significantly decreased the extent of lung edema, inflammatory cells infiltration, and ferroptosis in vivo, and Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is involved in astaxanthin inhibits LPS-induced ALI and ferroptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that astaxanthin inhibit inflammation and ferroptosis by regulating Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to reduce LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profiling defines shared and unique epithelial injury responses during kidney fibrosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying cellular events driving kidney fibrogenesis and metabolic dysfunction are incompletely understood. Here, we employed single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing to analyze 24 mouse kidneys from two fibrosis models. We profiled 309,666 cells in one experiment, representing 50 cell types/states encompassing epithelial, endothelial, immune, and stromal populations. Single-cell analysis identified diverse injury states of the proximal tubule, including two distinct early-phase populations with dysregulated lipid and amino acid metabolism, respectively. Lipid metabolism was defective in the chronic phase but was transiently activated in the very early stages of ischemia-induced injury, where we discovered increased lipid deposition and increased fatty acid β-oxidation. Perilipin 2 was identified as a surface marker of intracellular lipid droplets, and its knockdown in vitro disrupted cell energy state maintenance during lipid accumulation. Surveying epithelial cells across nephron segments identified shared and unique injury responses. Stromal cells exhibited high heterogeneity and contributed to fibrogenesis by epithelial-stromal crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 protects PM2.5 exposure-induced lung injury in mice by repressing inflammation and oxidative stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36242005/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Airborne fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) pollution is associated with the prevalence of respiratory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In patients with those diseases, circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels are increased, which contributes to airway nitric oxide deficiency, oxidative stress and inflammation. Overexpression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1), an enzyme degrading ADMA, exerts protective effects in animal models. However, the impact of DDAH1/ADMA on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and DDAH1-transgenic mice, as well as their respective wild-type (WT) littermates, were exposed to either filtered air or airborne PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; (mean daily concentration ~ 50 µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for 6 months through a whole-body exposure system. Mice were also acutely exposed to 10 mg/kg PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and/or exogenous ADMA (2 mg/kg) via intratracheal instillation every other day for 2 weeks. Inflammatory response, oxidative stress and related gene expressions in the lungs were examined. In addition, RAW264.7 cells were exposed to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and/or ADMA and the changes in intracellular oxidative stress and inflammatory response were determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice developed more severe lung injury than WT mice after long-term PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, which was associated with greater induction of pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation. In the lungs of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed mice, &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency increased protein expression of p-p65, iNOS and Bax, and decreased protein expression of Bcl-2, SOD1 and peroxiredoxin 4. Conversely, DDAH1 overexpression significantly alleviated lung injury, attenuated pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation, and exerted opposite effects on those proteins in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed mice. In addition, exogenous ADMA administration could mimic the effect of &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury, oxidative stress and inflammation. In PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed macrophages, ADMA aggravated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in an iNOS-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our data revealed that DDAH1 has a marked protective effect on long-term PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interplay between mucus mobility and alveolar macrophage targeting of surface-modified liposomes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36209941/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alveolar macrophages play a crucial role in the initiation and resolution of the immune response in the lungs. Pro-inflammatory M1 alveolar macrophages are an interesting target for treating inflammatory and infectious pulmonary diseases. One commune targeting strategy is to use nanoparticles conjugated with hyaluronic acid, which interact with CD44 overexpressed on the membrane of those cells. Unfortunately, this coating strategy may be countered by the presence on the surface of the nanoparticles of a poly(ethylene glycol) corona employed to improve nanoparticles&amp;rsquo; diffusion in the lung mucus. This study aims to measure this phenomenon by comparing the behavior in a murine lung inflammation model of three liposomal platforms designed to represent different poly(ethylene glycol) and hyaluronic acid densities (Liposome-PEG, Liposome-PEG-HA and Liposome-HA). In this work, the liposomes were obtained by a one-step ethanol injection method. Their interaction with mucin and targeting ability toward pro-inflammatory macrophages were then investigated in vitro and in vivo in a LPS model of lung inflammation. In vitro, poly(ethylene glycol) free HA-liposomes display a superior targeting efficiency toward M1 macrophages, while the addition of poly(ethylene glycol) induces better mucus mobility. Interestingly in vivo studies revealed that the three liposomes showed distinct cell specificity with alveolar macrophages demonstrating an avidity for poly(ethylene glycol) free HA-liposomes, while neutrophils favored PEGylated liposomes exempt of HA. Those results could be explained by the presence of two forces exercising a balance between mucus penetration and receptor targeting. This study corroborates the importance of considering the site of action and the targeted cells when designing nanoparticles to treat lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aortic ischemia and reperfusion leads to lung inflammatory activation with edema and leukocyte infiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E2 preventive effects include decreasing of edema, iNOS expression and preventing leukocyte infiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E2 is able to prevent the increased expression of ET-1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our study can be considered is one more step towards using E2 to prevent the local and remote inflammatory response after descending thoracic aorta cross-clamping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of systemic inflammation caused by ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) due to aortic occlusion, the lungs can exhibit increased microvascular permeability, local release of pro-inflammatory mediators, and leukocyte infiltration. Lung tissue infiltration by activated neutrophils is followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is linked to acute pulmonary microvascular damage, high mortality rates, and organ dysfunction. Previous studies have demonstrated that female sex hormones modulate the inflammatory response and that prophylactic treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2) can prevent fatalities and preserve mesenteric perfusion and intestinal integrity after ischemia/reperfusion induced by aortic occlusion. In this study, we focused on the protective effects of estradiol after aortic ischemia/reperfusion by evaluating lung injury and endothelial alterations. Upon anesthesia and mechanical ventilation, male rats were subjected to aortic occlusion for 20 min, followed by 2 h of reperfusion. In parallel, one group of rats received a single injection of estradiol (280 µg/kg, i.v.) 30 min before ischemia. We observed increased serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 in the I/R rats and E2 was able to reduce them. E2 effects after 2 h of reperfusion resulted mainly in decreasing of edema, iNOS expression and preventing leukocyte infiltration. Overall, our data indicate that estradiol might be a supplementary approach to deal with systemic processes and lung deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Microvesicles (MVs) derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) were demonstrated to restore lung protein permeability and attenuate acute lung injury. In our previous study, we found that MSC MV increased sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) kinase1 mRNA levels in injured human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC) significantly. However, the role of S1P signaling in MSC MV to restore lung protein permeability is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we hypothesized that MSC MV might restore lung permeability in part through increasing intracellular S1P signaling pathway in injured HLMVEC independent of S1P receptors. We used the transwell co-culture system to study the effect of MSC MV on protein permeability of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) damaged HLMVEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our results showed that LPS significantly increased the permeability of HLMVEC to FITC-dextran (70 kDa) within 24 h. MSC MV restores this permeability and, to a large extent, prevents the cytoskeleton protein F-actin from recombining into &amp;ldquo;actin stress fibers,&amp;rdquo; and restores the positions of tight junctions and adhesion junctions in the damaged HLMVEC. This therapeutic effect of MSC MV was related to the increase in the S1P level in injured HLMVEC and was not eliminated when adding the antagonist of S1P receptor, suggesting that MSC MV to restore lung permeability was independent of S1P receptors on HLMVEC. Laser confocal further observed that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mobilization and Rac1 activation in LPS injured HLMVEC were increased in parallel with the increase in intracellular S1P level after MSC MV treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In short, MSC MV partially restored protein permeability across HLMVEC through the intracellular S1P signaling pathway independent of S1P receptor-1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiota-derived succinate aggravates acute lung injury after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36229053/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Gut microbiota and their metabolic byproducts act as important modulators of the gut-lung axis. This study aimed to define the role of succinate, a key microbiota metabolite, in intestinal I/R-induced ALI progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Gut and lung microbiota of mice subjected to intestinal I/R were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Succinate level alterations were measured in Germ-free (GF) mice or conventional mice treated with antibiotics. Succinate-induced alveolar macrophage polarisation and its effects on alveolar epithelial apoptosis were evaluated in succinate receptor1 (&lt;em&gt;Sucnr1&lt;/em&gt;)-deficient mice and in murine alveolar macrophages transfected with &lt;em&gt;Sucnr1&lt;/em&gt;-siRNA. Succinate levels were measured in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, including intestinal I/R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Succinate accumulated in lungs after intestinal I/R, and this was associated with an imbalance of succinate-producing and succinate-consuming bacteria in the gut, but not the lungs. Succinate accumulation was absent in GF mice and was reversed by gut microbiota depletion with antibiotics, indicating that gut microbiota are a source of lung succinate. Moreover, succinate promoted alveolar macrophage polarisation, alveolar epithelial apoptosis, and lung injury during intestinal I/R. Conversely, knockdown of &lt;em&gt;Sucnr1&lt;/em&gt; or blockage of SUCNR1 &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; reversed the effects of succinate by modulating PI3K-AKT/HIF-1α pathway. Plasma succinate levels significantly correlated with intestinal I/R-related lung injury after cardiopulmonary bypass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Gut microbiota-derived succinate exacerbates intestinal I/R-induced ALI through SUCNR1-dependent alveolar macrophage polarisation, identifying succinate as a novel target for gut-derived ALI in critically ill patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oxaloacetate acid ameliorates paraquat-induced acute lung injury by alleviating oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36313362/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is the primary cause of death among patients with acute paraquat (PQ) poisoning, whereby peroxidative damage is an important mechanism underlying PQ-induced lung injury. There is a lack of effective interventional drugs for patients with PQ poisoning. Oxaloacetic acid (OAA) participates in multiple &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; metabolic processes, whereby it facilitates the clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improves mitochondrial function. The study aimed to assess the protective effects of OAA on PQ-induced ALI and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. Our data demonstrated that OAA treatment significantly alleviated PQ-induced ALI and improved the survival rate of PQ-poisoned mice, and also alleviated PQ-induced cellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. OAA-mediated alleviation of PQ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction depends on the following mechanisms which may explain the above findings: 1) OAA effectively cleared intracellular ROS, inhibited ROS accumulation, and mitochondrial depolarization; 2) OAA inhibited the downregulation of L-OPA1 and MFN2 caused by PQ and promoted a dynamic balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission, and 3) the expression of PGC-1α, TFAM, COX2, and COX4I1, increased significantly following OAA intervention which improved mitochondrial respiratory functions and promoted its biogenesis and energy metabolism in damaged cells. In conclusion, OAA effectively cleared ROS and improved mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby significantly improving ALI caused by PQ poisoning and the animal survival rate. Therefore, OAA may be a potential drug for the treatment of PQ poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In-line miniature 3D-printed pressure-cycled ventilator maintains respiratory homeostasis in swine with induced acute pulmonary injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36223450/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the need for inexpensive, easy-to-use, rapidly mass-produced resuscitation devices that could be quickly distributed in areas of critical need. In-line miniature ventilators based on principles of fluidics ventilate patients by automatically oscillating between forced inspiration and assisted expiration as airway pressure changes, requiring only a continuous supply of pressurized oxygen. Here, we designed three miniature ventilator models to operate in specific pressure ranges along a continuum of clinical lung injury (mild, moderate, and severe injury). Three-dimensional (3D)-printed prototype devices evaluated in a lung simulator generated airway pressures, tidal volumes, and minute ventilation within the targeted range for the state of lung disease each was designed to support. In testing in domestic swine before and after induction of pulmonary injury, the ventilators for mild and moderate injury met the design criteria when matched with the appropriate degree of lung injury. Although the ventilator for severe injury provided the specified design pressures, respiratory rate was elevated with reduced minute ventilation, a result of lung compliance below design parameters. Respiratory rate reflected how well each ventilator matched the injury state of the lungs and could guide selection of ventilator models in clinical use. This simple device could help mitigate shortages of conventional ventilators during pandemics and other disasters requiring rapid access to advanced airway management, or in transport applications for hands-free ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-1249 on Endothelial Extracellular Vesicles Mediates Cigarette Smoke-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension by Inhibiting HDAC10 (Histone Deacetylase 10)-NFκB (Nuclear Factor κB)-CaSR (Calcium-Sensing Receptor) Cascade</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36252137/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Overproduction of endothelial extracellular vesicles (eEVs) is correlated with pulmonary hypertension progression, but the precise mechanism remains largely unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; MicroRNA-chip and real-time polymerase chain reaction were conducted to screen and validate microRNA profiles in blood plasma eEVs of rats and human with or without cigarette smoking. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were cultured to study signaling pathways. Pulmonary hypertension phenotypes were evaluated in wild-type and calcium-sensing receptor knockout rats to identify the pathophysiological significance of the microRNA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MicroR-1249 was predominant highly expressed in eEVs from plasma of rats exposed to cigarette smoking, and confirmed in eEVs from plasma of human smokers as well as in eEVs from cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery endothelial cells, but not in cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. In cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, microR-1249 downregulated the expression of histone deacetylase 10, which in turn enhanced the acetylated form of NFκB (nuclear factor κB) level and its nuclear translocation leading to increased expression of calcium-sensing receptor. In rats, the repression of microR-1249 in eEVs by microR-1249 inhibitor, histone deacetylase 10 overexpression, or calcium-sensing receptor knockout profoundly inhibited the proliferative capacities and diminished apoptosis-resistance of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and pulmonary hypertension development in rats intravenously administrated with eEVs preparation from cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Cigarette smoke-enriched microR-1249 in endothelial extracellular vesicles facilitates the hyperproliferative and antiapoptotic status of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells promoting pulmonary hypertension evolution through the inhibition of histone deacetylase 10-NFκB-calcium-sensing receptor cascade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Precise Monitoring and Assessing Treatment Response of Sepsis-Induced Acute Lung Hypoxia with a Nitroreductase-Activated Golgi-Targetable Fluorescent Probe</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36223488/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is mostly attributed to an outbreak of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which makes leukocytes infiltrate into the lung and results in lung hypoxia. Nitroreductase (NTR) is significantly upregulated under hypoxia, which is commonly regarded as a potential biomarker for assessing sepsis-induced acute lung hypoxia. Increasing evidence shows that NTR in the Golgi apparatus could be induced in sepsis-induced ALI. Meanwhile, the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor (dimethyloxalylglycine, DMOG) attenuated sepsis-induced ALI through further increasing the level of Golgi NTR by improving hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activity, but as yet, no Golgi-targetable probe has been developed for monitoring and assessing treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI. Herein, we report a Golgi-targetable probe, Gol-NTR, for monitoring and assessing treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI through mapping the generation of NTR. The probe displayed high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 54.8 ng/mL and good selectivity to NTR. In addition, due to the excellent characteristics of Golgi-targetable, Gol-NTR was successfully applied in mapping the change of Golgi NTR in cells and zebrafish caused by various stimuli. Most importantly, the production of Golgi NTR in the sepsis-induced ALI and the PHD inhibitor (DMOG) against sepsis-induced ALI were visualized and precisely assessed for the first time with the assistance of Gol-NTR. The results demonstrated the practicability of Gol-NTR for the precise monitoring and assessing of the personalized treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schisandrin B protects against LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury by targeting MyD88</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36270224/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a challenging clinical syndrome that manifests as an acute inflammatory response. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a bioactive lignan from Schisandra genus plants, has been shown to suppress inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypothesis/purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study performed an in-depth investigation of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Sch B in macrophages and in an animal model of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; qPCR array was used to probe the differential effects and potential target of Sch B. ALI was induced by intratracheal administration of LPS in experimental mice with or without Sch B treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our studies show that Sch B differentially modulates inflammatory factor induction by LPS in macrophages by directly binding myeloid differentiation response factor-88 (MyD88), an essential adaptor protein in the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) pathway. Sch B spares non-MyD88-pathways downstream of TLR4. Such inhibition suppressed key signaling mediators such as TAK1, MAPKs, and NF-κB, and pro-inflammatory factor induction. Pull down assay using biotinylated-Sch B validate the direct interaction between Sch B and MyD88 in macrophages. Treatment of mice with Sch B prior to LPS challenge reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in lungs, induction of MyD88-pathway signaling proteins, and prevented inflammatory cytokine induction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, our studies have identified MyD88 as a direct target of Sch B for its anti-inflammatory activity, and suggest that Sch B may have therapeutic value for acute lung injury and other MyD88-dependent inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C-X-C-Chemokine-Receptor-Type-4 Inhibitor AMD3100 Attenuates Pulmonary Inflammation and Fibrosis in Silicotic Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36238768/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Silicosis is a severe pulmonary disease caused by inhaling dust containing crystalline silica. The progression of silicosis to pulmonary fibrosis is usually unavoidable. Recent studies have revealed positivity for the overexpression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in pulmonary fibrosis and shown that the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 attenuated pulmonary fibrosis after bleomycin challenge and paraquat exposure. However, it is unclear whether AMD3100 reduces crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 male mice were instilled intranasally with a single dose of crystalline silica (12 mg/60 μL) to establish an acute silicosis mouse model. Twelve hours later, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg AMD3100 or control solution. Then, the mice were weighed daily and sacrificed on day 7, 14, or 28 to collect lung tissue and peripheral blood. Western blotting was also applied to determine the level of CXCR4, while different histological techniques were used to assess pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In addition, the level of B cells in peripheral blood was measured by flow cytometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 were upregulated in the lung tissues of crystalline silica-exposed mice. Blocking CXCR4 with AMD3100 suppressed the upregulation of CXCR4/CXCL12, reduced the severity of lung injury, and prevented weight loss. It also inhibited neutrophil infiltration at inflammatory sites and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, as well as reduced B-lymphocyte aggregates in the lung. Additionally, it decreased the recruitment of circulating fibrocytes (CD45+collagen I+CXCR4+) to the lung and the deposition of collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin in lung tissue. AMD3100 also increased the level of B cells in peripheral blood, preventing circulating B cells from migrating to the injured lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Blocking CXCR4 with AMD3100 delays pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in a silicosis mouse model, suggesting the potential of AMD3100 as a drug for treating silicosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing in the elderly. COPD is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway remodeling and alveolar emphysema. COPD patients are also at high risk for mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. &lt;em&gt;Ninjin&amp;rsquo;yoeito&lt;/em&gt; (NYT) is prescribed to patients with conditions such as post-illness and postoperative weakness, fatigue, poor appetite, skin rash, cold hands and feet, and anemia. In addition to traditional uses, NYT is also prescribed as a therapeutic drug for poor functioning of the digestive organs, respiratory organs, and urinary organs. NYT is also known to have an antioxidant effect. The objective of this study was to investigate whether NYT could ameliorate COPD-induced lung injury and anxiety/depression in aged C57BL/6J mice exposed to porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE). While intratracheal administration of PPE induced emphysema in elderly mice, long-term administration of NYT suppressed the pathology. NYT was also found to suppress the apoptosis and oxidative stress caused by PPE. In addition, long-term administration of NYT was found to ameliorate PPE-induced depressive-like behavior in three different behavioral studies. These results suggest that NYT has a therapeutic effect on emphysema and the behavioral abnormalities caused by PPE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sulforaphane alleviated vascular remodeling in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension via inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36220525/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH) is a cardiopulmonary disease featured by pulmonary vascular remodeling, which is due to abnormal proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and dysfunction of endothelial cells (ECs). Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural isothiocyanate extracted from cruciferous vegetables with promising anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of SFN on HPH. Male mice were exposed to persistent chronic hypoxia for 4 weeks to induce HPH. The results demonstrated that SFN repressed the increased right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and attenuated the right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary arteries remodeling in HPH mice. In particular, after SFN treatment, the CD68 positive cells in lung sections were reduced; TNF-α and IL-6 levels in lungs and serum declined; activation of NF-κB in PASMCs was inhibited in response to hypoxia. Besides, SFN enhanced the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum, SOD2 expression, total glutathione levels, and GSH/GSSG ratio in PASMCs, along with a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in serum and ROS production in PASMCs after hypoxia exposure. Notably, SFN, as an Nrf2 activator, reversed the reduction in Nrf2 expression in hypoxic PASMCs. In vitro, SFN treatment inhibited hyperproliferation and promoted apoptosis of PASMCs under hypoxia conditions. SFN also prevented the apoptosis of pulmonary microvascular ECs caused by hypoxia. Therefore, these data suggested that SFN could significantly restrain the inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting PASMCs proliferation, promoting PASMCs apoptosis, and reversing hypoxia injury in ECs to improve pulmonary vascular remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distinct roles of ORAI1 in T cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation and immunity to influenza A virus infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T cell activation and function depend on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals mediated by store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE) through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release-activated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (CRAC) channels formed by ORAI1 proteins. We here investigated how SOCE controls T cell function in pulmonary inflammation during a T helper 1 (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1) cell-mediated response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation. T cell-specific deletion of &lt;em&gt;Orai1&lt;/em&gt; did not exacerbate pulmonary inflammation and viral burdens following IAV infection but protected mice from house dust mite-induced allergic airway inflammation. ORAI1 controlled the expression of genes including p53 and E2F transcription factors that regulate the cell cycle in T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells in response to allergen stimulation and the expression of transcription factors and cytokines that regulate T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell function. Systemic application of a CRAC channel blocker suppressed allergic airway inflammation without compromising immunity to IAV infection, suggesting that inhibition of SOCE is a potential treatment for allergic airway disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2,3,5,4&#39;-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside ameliorates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via regulating pro-fibrotic signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36267283/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2,3,5,4&amp;rsquo;-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-Glucoside (THSG) is the main active ingredient extracted from &lt;em&gt;Polygonum multiflorum&lt;/em&gt; Thunb. (PMT), which has been reported to possess extensive pharmacological properties. Nevertheless, the exact role of THSG in pulmonary fibrosis has not been demonstrated yet. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of THSG against bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis in a murine model, and explore the underlying mechanisms of THSG in transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)-induced fibrogenesis using MRC-5 human lung fibroblast cells. We found that THSG significantly attenuated lung injury by reducing fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition. THSG treatment significantly downregulated the expression levels of TGF-β1, fibronectin, α-SMA, CTGF, and TGFBR2, however, upregulated the expression levels of antioxidants (SOD-1 and catalase) and LC3B in the lungs of BLM-treated mice. THSG treatment decreased the expression levels of fibronectin, α-SMA, and CTGF in TGF-β1-stimulated MRC-5 cells. Conversely, THSG increased the expression levels of SOD-1 and catalase. Furthermore, treatment of THSG profoundly reduced the TGF-β1-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, THSG restored TGF-β1-induced impaired autophagy, accompany by increasing the protein levels of LC3B-II and Beclin 1. Mechanism study indicated that THSG significantly reduced TGF-β1-induced increase of TGFBR2 expression and phosphorylation of Smad2/3, Akt, mTOR, and ERK1/2 in MRC-5 cells. These findings suggest that THSG may be considered as an anti-fibrotic drug for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electronic cigarette vaping with aged coils causes acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36195745/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been used widely as an alternative to conventional cigarettes and have become particularly popular among young adults. A growing body of evidence has shown that e-cigarettes are associated with acute lung injury and adverse effects in multiple other organs. Previous studies showed that high emissions of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) in aerosols were associated with increased usage of the same e-cigarette coils. However, the impact on lung function of using aged coils has not been reported. We investigated the relationship between coil age and acute lung injury in mice exposed to experimental vaping for 1 h (2 puffs/min, 100 ml/puff). The e-liquid contains propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (50:50, vol) only. The concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in the vaping aerosols increased with age of the nichrome coils starting at 1200 puffs. Mice exposed to e-cigarette aerosols produced from 1800, but not 0 or 900, puff-aged coils caused acute lung injury, increased lung wet/dry weight ratio, and induced lung inflammation (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP-2). Exposure to vaping aerosols from 1800 puff-aged coils decreased heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation in mice compared to mice exposed to air or aerosols from new coils. In conclusion, we observed that the concentration of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) increased with repeated and prolonged usage of e-cigarette coils. Exposure to high levels of aldehyde in vaping aerosol was associated with acute lung injury in mice. These findings show significant risk of lung injury associated with prolonged use of e-cigarette devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RNA N6 -methyladenosine modifications and potential targeted therapeutic strategies in kidney disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic modifications have received increasing attention and have been shown to be extensively involved in kidney development and disease progression. Among them, the most common RNA modification, N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A), has been shown to dynamically and reversibly exert its functions in multiple ways, including splicing, export, decay and translation initiation efficiency to regulate mRNA fate. Moreover, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A has also been reported to exert biological effects by destabilizing base pairing to modulate various functions of RNAs. Most importantly, an increasing number of kidney diseases, such as renal cell carcinoma, acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, have been found to be associated with aberrant m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A patterns. In this review, we comprehensively review the critical roles of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A in kidney diseases and discuss the possibilities and relevance of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-targeted epigenetic therapy, with an integrated comprehensive description of the detailed alterations in specific loci that contribute to cellular processes that are associated with kidney diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tubular cell polyploidy protects from lethal acute kidney injury but promotes consequent chronic kidney disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36195583/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequent, often fatal and, for lack of specific therapies, can leave survivors with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We characterize the distribution of tubular cells (TC) undergoing polyploidy along AKI by DNA content analysis and single cell RNA-sequencing. Furthermore, we study the functional roles of polyploidization using transgenic models and drug interventions. We identify YAP1-driven TC polyploidization outside the site of injury as a rapid way to sustain residual kidney function early during AKI. This survival mechanism comes at the cost of senescence of polyploid TC promoting interstitial fibrosis and CKD in AKI survivors. However, targeting TC polyploidization after the early AKI phase can prevent AKI-CKD transition without influencing AKI lethality. Senolytic treatment prevents CKD by blocking repeated TC polyploidization cycles. These results revise the current pathophysiological concept of how the kidney responds to acute injury and identify a novel druggable target to improve prognosis in AKI survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A-Kinase Anchor Protein 1 deficiency causes mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse model of hyperoxia induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36263130/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Critically ill patients on supplemental oxygen therapy eventually develop acute lung injury (ALI). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during ALI perturbs the mitochondrial dynamics resulting in cellular damage. Genetic deletion of the mitochondrial A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (Akap1) in mice resulted in mitochondrial damage, Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, increased expression of mitophagy proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines, exacerbating hyperoxia-induced Acute Lung Injury (HALI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Despite a strong causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction and HALI, the mechanisms governing the disease progression at the transcriptome level is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was carried out using the lungs of Akap1 knockout (&lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice exposed to normoxia or 48 h of hyperoxia followed by quantitative real time PCR and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Western blot analysis assessed mitochondrial dysfunction, OXPHOS complex (I-V), apoptosis and antioxidant proteins. Mitochondrial enzymatic assays was used to measure the aconitase, fumarase, citrate synthase activities in isolated mitochondria from &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; vs. Wt mice exposed to hyperoxia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Transcriptome analysis of &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; exposed to hyperoxia reveals increases in transcripts encoding electron transport chain (ETC) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) proteins. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) shows enrichment of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation in &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Loss of AKAP1, coupled with oxidant injury, significantly decreases the activities of TCA enzymes. Mechanistically, a significant loss of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) phosphorylation at the protein kinase A (PKA) site Serine 637 (Ser637), decreases in Akt phosphorylation at Serine 437 (Ser47) and increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax indicate mitochondrial dysfunction. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels significantly increased in CD68 positive alveolar macrophages in &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lungs, suggesting a strong antioxidant response to hyperoxia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Overall these results suggest that AKAP1 overexpression and modulation of Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser637 is an important therapeutic strategy for acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The mitochondrial calcium uniporter of pulmonary type 2 cells determines severity of acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute Lung Injury (ALI) due to inhaled pathogens causes high mortality. Underlying mechanisms are inadequately understood. Here, by optical imaging of live mouse lungs we show that a key mechanism is the viability of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering by the mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uniporter (MCU) in the lung&amp;rsquo;s surfactant-secreting, alveolar type 2 cells (AT2). The buffering increased mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and induced surfactant secretion in wild-type mice, but not in mice with AT2-specific MCU knockout. In the knockout mice, ALI due to intranasal LPS instillation caused severe pulmonary edema and mortality, which were mitigated by surfactant replenishment prior to LPS instillation, indicating surfactant&amp;rsquo;s protective effect against alveolar edema. In wild-type mice, intranasal LPS, or &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; decreased AT2 MCU. Loss of MCU abrogated buffering. The resulting mortality was reduced by spontaneous recovery of MCU expression, or by MCU replenishment. Enhancement of AT2 mitochondrial buffering, hence endogenous surfactant secretion, through MCU replenishment might be a therapy against ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aberrant methylation of Serpine1 mediates lung injury in neonatal mice prenatally exposed to intrauterine inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36183130/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36183130/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Intrauterine inflammation (IUI) alters epigenetic modifications in offspring, leading to lung injury. However, the epigenetic mechanism underlying IUI-induced lung injury remains uncertain. In the present study, we aim to investigate the effect of IUI on lung development, and to identify the key molecule involved in this process and its epigenetic regulatory mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Serpine1 was upregulated in the lung tissue of neonatal mice with IUI. Intranasal delivery of Serpine1 siRNA markedly reversed IUI-induced lung injury. Serpine1 overexpression substantially promoted cell senescence of both human and murine lung epithelial cells, reflected by decreased cell proliferation and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, G0/G1 cell fraction, senescence marker, and oxidative and DNA damage marker expression. IUI decreased the methylation level of the Serpine1 promoter, and methylation of the promoter led to transcriptional repression of Serpine1. Furthermore, IUI promoted the expression of Tet1 potentially through TNF-α, while Tet1 facilitated the demethylation of Serpine1 promoter. DNA pull-down and ChIP assays revealed that the Serpine1 promoter was regulated by Rela and Hdac2. DNA demethylation increased the recruitment of Rela to the Serpine1 promoter and induced the release of Hdac2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Increased Serpine1 expression mediated by DNA demethylation causes lung injury in neonatal mice with IUI. Therefore, therapeutic interventions targeting Serpine1 may effectively prevent IUI-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblast growth factor 10 attenuates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by protecting against glycocalyx impairment and endothelial apoptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36183124/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The defects and imbalance in lung repair and structural maintenance contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), yet the molecular mechanisms that regulate lung repair process are so far incompletely understood. We hypothesized that cigarette smoking causes glycocalyx impairment and endothelial apoptosis in COPD, which could be repaired by the stimulation of fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10)/FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used immunostaining (immunohistochemical [IHC] and immunofluorescence [IF]) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the levels of glycocalyx components and endothelial apoptosis in animal models and in patients with COPD. We used the murine emphysema model and in vitro studies to determine the protective and reparative role of FGF10/FGFR1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Exposure to cigarette smoke caused endothelial glycocalyx impairment and emphysematous changes in murine models and human specimens. Pretreatment of FGF10 attenuated the development of emphysema and the shedding of glycocalyx components induced by CSE &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. However, FGF10 did not attenuate the emphysema induced by endothelial-specific killing peptide CGSPGWVRC-GG-&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;(KLAKLAK)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Mechanistically, FGF10 alleviated smoke-induced endothelial apoptosis and glycocalyx repair through FGFR1/ERK/SOX9/HS6ST1 signaling &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. FGF10 was shown to repair pulmonary glycocalyx injury and endothelial apoptosis, and attenuate smoke-induced COPD through FGFR1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results suggest that FGF10 may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy against COPD via endothelial repair and glycocalyx reconstitution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important step in tumor progression, which enables tumor cells to acquire migration and invasion characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of biological biochanin A (BCA) in ameliorating fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) lung injury. The results showed that PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; could induce spindle-like changes in cell morphology, causing the ability of migration and invasion. However, they were significantly inhibited by BCA treatment (10/20/30 μm). After BCA treatment, the release and transcription of chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor gene CXCR4 were inhibited, and the release of growth inducer TGF-β1 was significantly reduced. In addition, BCA promoted the transcription of E-cadherin and β-catenin, inhibiting the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin, and down-regulated the expression of MMP-2/9. We found that BCA effectively interfered with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activated by PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;. In conclusion, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; can induce EMT in lung cancer cells, and BCA may reverse this process by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Traumatic brain injury alters dendritic cell differentiation and distribution in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36183126/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36183126/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pathophysiological consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) mediated secondary injury remain incompletely understood. In particular, the impact of TBI on the differentiation and maintenance of dendritic cells (DCs), which are regarded as the most professional antigen presenting cells of the immune system, remains completely unknown. Here, we report that DC-differentiation, maintenance and functions are altered on day 3 and day 7 after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Long bones, spleen, peripheral lymph nodes (pLNs), mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), liver, lungs, skin and blood were collected from mice with either moderate-level cortical impact (CCI) or sham on day 1, day 3 or day 7 after TBI. Bone marrow cells were isolated from the tibias and femurs of hind limb through flushing. Tissues were digested with Collagenase-D and DNase I. Skin biopsies were digested in the presence of liberase + DNase I. Single cell suspensions were made, red blood cells were lysed with Ammonium chloride (Stem Cell Technology) and subsequently filtered using a 70 μM nylon mesh. DC subsets of the tissues and DC progenitors of the BM were identified through 10-color flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping studies. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were identified through H2DCFDA staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our studies identify that; (1) frequencies and absolute numbers of DCs in the spleen and BM are altered on day 3 and day 7 after TBI; (2) surface expression of key molecules involved in antigen presentation of DCs were affected on day 3 and day 7 after TBI; (3) distribution and functions of tissue-specific DC subsets of both circulatory and lymphatic systems were imbalanced following TBI; (4) early differentiation program of DCs, especially the commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to common DC progenitors (CDPs), were deregulated after TBI; and (5) intracellular ROS levels were reduced in DC progenitors and differentiated DCs on day 3 and day 7 after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our data demonstrate, for the first time, that TBI affects the distribution pattern of DCs and induces an imbalance among DC subsets in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. In addition, the current study demonstrates that TBI results in reduced levels of ROS in DCs on day 3 and day 7 after TBI, which may explain altered DC differentiation paradigm following TBI. A deeper understanding on the molecular mechanisms that contribute to DC defects following TBI would be essential and beneficial in treating infections in patients with acute central nervous system (CNS) injuries, such as TBI, stroke and spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-9a-5p alleviates ventilator-induced lung injury in rats by inhibiting the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway via CXCR4 expression downregulation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36193608/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I establishment of (ventilator-induced acute lung injury) VILI rat model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used bioinformatics software to predict the target gene of miR-9a-5p, and verified the conclusion through double Luciferase Report experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) through lavage fluid recovery technology for experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Globally, Mechanical ventilation is the most commonly used short-term life support technology. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is an inflammatory injury caused by mechanical ventilation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as new gene regulators that play an important role in lung injury and inflammation. However, the role and mechanism of action of miR-9a-5p in VILI remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Herein, a rat model of VILI was established. To determine the expression levels of miR-9a-5p and CXCR4 mRNA, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were conducted. As well as western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence analyses, we determined the expression of CXCR4, SDF-1 and MAPK signaling pathway-related kinases. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining and the wet-dry ratio of the lung tissue were used to evaluate organ injury. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity measurements were performed to evaluate the inflammatory response. In addition, double luciferase reporter assays were used to verify the association between miR-9a-5p and CXCR4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The expression of miR-9a-5p was low, whereas that of CXCR4 was high in the lung tissues of VILI rats. The overexpression of miR-9a-5p alleviated the degree of pathological injury in the lung tissues of rats with VILI, downregulating inflammatory cytokine expression and MPO activity. In the VILI rat model, miR-9a-5p targeted the negative regulation of CXCR4, and CXCR4 overexpression to reverse the lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of miR-9a-5p overexpression in VILI rats. miR-9a-5p also inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal receptor-activated kinase (ERK), a protein related to the MAPK signaling pathway, by downregulating CXCR4 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; miR-9a-5p can hinder the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and reduce inflammatory reactions and lung injury in VILI rats through the targeted regulation of CXCR4 expression. Therefore, miR-9a-5p could serve as an intervention target to supply a new strategy for the care of VILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanodrugs alleviate acute kidney injury: Manipulate RONS at kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36203963/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AKI is a common clinical acute syndrome with high morbidity and mortality but without effective clinical drug available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hypoxia and accumulation of toxic substances are key pathological features of various heterogeneous AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive RONS is the core of the pathological mechanism of AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The development of nanodrugs is expected to achieve successful treatment in AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no clinical drugs available to treat acute kidney injury (AKI). Given the high prevalence and high mortality rate of AKI, the development of drugs to effectively treat AKI is a huge unmet medical need and a research hotspot. Although existing evidence fully demonstrates that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) burst at the AKI site is a major contributor to AKI progression, the heterogeneity, complexity, and unique physiological structure of the kidney make most antioxidant and anti-inflammatory small molecule drugs ineffective because of the lack of kidney targeting and side effects. Recently, nanodrugs with intrinsic kidney targeting through the control of size, shape, and surface properties have opened exciting prospects for the treatment of AKI. Many antioxidant nanodrugs have emerged to address the limitations of current AKI treatments. In this review, we systematically summarized for the first time about the emerging nanodrugs that exploit the pathological and physiological features of the kidney to overcome the limitations of traditional small-molecule drugs to achieve high AKI efficacy. First, we analyzed the pathological structural characteristics of AKI and the main pathological mechanism of AKI: hypoxia, harmful substance accumulation-induced RONS burst at the renal site despite the multifactorial initiation and heterogeneity of AKI. Subsequently, we introduced the strategies used to improve renal targeting and reviewed advances of nanodrugs for AKI: nano-RONS-sacrificial agents, antioxidant nanozymes, and nanocarriers for antioxidants and anti-inflammatory drugs. These nanodrugs have demonstrated excellent therapeutic effects, such as greatly reducing oxidative stress damage, restoring renal function, and low side effects. Finally, we discussed the challenges and future directions for translating nanodrugs into clinical AKI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensing and clearance of dysfunctional lysosomes is critical for cellular homeostasis. Here we show that transcription factor EB (TFEB)-a master transcriptional regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy-is activated during the lysosomal damage response, and its activation is dependent on the function of the ATG conjugation system, which mediates LC3 lipidation. In addition, lysosomal damage triggers LC3 recruitment on lysosomes, where lipidated LC3 interacts with the lysosomal calcium channel TRPML1, facilitating calcium efflux essential for TFEB activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence and importance of this TFEB activation mechanism in kidneys in a mouse model of oxalate nephropathy accompanying lysosomal damage. A proximal tubule-specific TFEB-knockout mouse exhibited progression of kidney injury induced by oxalate crystals. Together, our results reveal unexpected mechanisms of TFEB activation by LC3 lipidation and their physiological relevance during the lysosomal damage response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lycopene attenuates the inflammation and apoptosis in aristolochic acid nephropathy by targeting the Nrf2 antioxidant system</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36198206/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene improves renal dysfunction in mice with aristolochic acid nephropathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene inhibits oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the kidney of mice with aristolochic acid nephropathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway is critical to inhibit the development of renal inflammatory response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene activates the Nrf2 antioxidant system and then inhibits apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lycopene (LYC) is a carotenoid, has antioxidant properties. This study investigated whether lycopene attenuates aristolochic acids (AAs) -induced chronic kidney disease. In this experiment, lycopene was used to intervene C57BL/6 mice with renal injury induced by aristolochic acid exposure. The histomorphological changes and serological parameters of the kidney were measured in order to assess the alleviating effect of lycopene on renal injury in aristolochic acid nephropathy. In vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to verify the main mechanism of action and drug targets of lycopene in improving aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) and by various experimental methods such as ELISA, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Western-blot and qRT-PCR. The results showed that oxidative stress injury was induced in the kidney of mice after AAI exposure, resulting in inflammatory response and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. The results showed that the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway was inhibited after AAI exposure. AAI induces oxidative stress injury in the kidney, which ultimately leads to inflammation and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. After LYC intervened in the body, it activated Nrf2 nuclear translocation and its downstream HO-1 and NQO1 antioxidant signaling pathways. LYC inhibited ROS production by renal tubular epithelial cells, and alleviated mitochondrial damage. LYC further modulated the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling cascade, thereby reduced the accumulation of inflammatory factors in the renal interstitium. Moreover, LYC was able to up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2, down-regulate Bax expression and inhibit the activation of cleaved forms of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3, which finally attenuated the apoptosis of the mitochondrial pathway induced by AAI exposure. It was concluded that lycopene was able to activate the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway to maintain the homeostasis of renal oxidative stress and ultimately attenuated renal inflammatory response and apoptosis. These results suggested that lycopene can be used as a drug to relieve AAN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polysaccharides from Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury by modulating TLR4/COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polysaccharides from &lt;em&gt;Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum&lt;/em&gt; Diels et Gilg (SYQP) attenuated LPS-induced ALI in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYQP exerted anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYQP alleviated ALI by inhibiting TLR4/COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum&lt;/em&gt; Diels et Gilg (Sanyeqing, SYQ), a traditional herb native to China, has been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, febrile convulsions and dysentery. Previous studies have demonstrated the hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects of polysaccharides from SYQ (SYQP). However, the role of SYQP in acute lung injury (ALI) remained unknown. Our present study aimed to explore the protective effects of SYQP in ALI and explained its underlying mechanism. In vivo, Balb/c mice were intragastrically administered with SYQP and dexamethasone (DXMS) for 14 days which were intratracheally instilled (IT) with LPS at the last day. In vitro, A549 cells were pretreated with SYQP, DXMS or TAK-242, following by LPS stimulation for 24 h. The histopathological results showed that SYQP remarkably alleviated pulmonary macrophage infiltration and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels. Additionally, SYQP evidently suppressed wet/dry (W/D) ratio of lung and white blood cells (WBC) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Moreover, SYQP markedly reduced TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and COX-2 levels both in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, SYQP significantly attenuated oxidative stress through upregulating the levels of SOD and GSH-Px and downregulating the expressions of MDA and LDH in vivo, which was confirmed by in vitro results that SYQP could increase SOD activity and decrease MDA and NO contents. Importantly, a decline in protein expressions of TLR4, COX-2, NF-κB p50, phospho-NF-κB p65 and phospho-IκB-α was detected in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our results demonstrated that SYQP ameliorated LPS-induced ALI by alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress via attenuating TLR4/COX-2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chlorogenic acid enhances alveolar macrophages phagocytosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome by activating G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR 37)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36194973/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36194973/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impaired alveolar macrophages phagocytosis can contribute to pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and negatively impacts clinical outcomes. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound with potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant bioactivities. Studies have shown that CGA plays a protective role in ARDS, however, the precise protective mechanism of CGA against ARDS, is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate whether CGA enhances alveolar macrophages phagocytosis to attenuate lung injury during ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (100 μg/ml for 24 h) and treated with CGA (100, 200, and 400 μM CGA for 1 h) to measure pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, GPR37 expression and macrophages phagocytosis. Mouse models of ARDS induced by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) surgery were treated with CGA (100 or 200 mg/kg) to investigate lung inflammatory injury and alveolar macrophages phagocytosis. Computational modeling was performed to examine potential binding sites of G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) with CGA, and the results were validated by interfering with the binding sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Result&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, CGA notably ameliorated inflammatory response and increased phagocytosis in lipopolysaccharides-induced RAW264.7 cells. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, CGA administration significantly alleviated lung inflammatory injury, decreased the bacteria load in the lung, promoted alveolar macrophages phagocytosis and improved the survival rate in mice with CLP-induced ARDS. Moreover, CGA markedly upregulated the expression of GPR37 &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. However, the protective effect of CGA against ARDS were reversed after silencing the expression of GPR37.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CGA has a protective effect against ARDS and may enhance alveolar macrophages phagocytosis and attenuate lung inflammatory injury by upregulating GPR37 expression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating Myeloid Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles as Mediators of Indirect Acute Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood-borne myeloid cells, neutrophils and monocytes, play a central role in the development of indirect acute lung injury (ALI) during sepsis and non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). By contrast, the contribution of circulating myeloid cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) to ALI is unknown, despite acute increases in their numbers during sepsis and SIRS. Here, we investigated the direct role of circulating myeloid-EVs in ALI using a mouse isolated perfused lung system and a human cell coculture model of pulmonary vascular inflammation consisting of lung microvascular endothelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Total and immunoaffinity-isolated myeloid (CD11b+) and platelet (CD41+) EVs were prepared from the plasma of i.v. LPS-injected endotoxemic donor mice and transferred directly into recipient lungs. Two-hour perfusion of lungs with unfractionated EVs from a single donor induced pulmonary edema formation and increased perfusate levels of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), consistent with lung injury. These responses were abolished in the lungs of monocyte-depleted mice. The isolated myeloid- but not platelet-EVs produced a similar injury response and the acute intravascular release of proinflammatory cytokines and endothelial injury markers. In the in vitro human coculture model, human myeloid (CD11b+) but not platelet (CD61+) EVs isolated from LPS-stimulated whole blood induced acute proinflammatory cytokine production and endothelial activation. These findings implicate circulating myeloid-EVs as acute mediators of pulmonary vascular inflammation and edema, suggesting an alternative therapeutic target for attenuation of indirect ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal Microbiota-derived Propionic Acid Protects against Zinc Oxide Nanoparticle-induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150095/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of nanotechnology, the risks of accidental and/or occupational exposure to zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) are increasing. Inhalation of ZnONPs induces metal fume fever in humans and acute lung injury (ALI) in animal models. Although the intestinal microbiota is considered an important modulator of various diseases, the role and mechanism of intestinal microbiota in the pathology of ZnONP-induced ALI are unclear. Herein, we established an intratracheal instillation of a ZnONP-induced ALI mouse model and found that the inhalation of ZnONPs caused ALI along with a perturbation of intestinal flora. Antibiotic cocktail treatment-mediated depletion of intestinal microbiota aggravated ZnONP-induced ALI, and in contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation-mediated restoration of intestinal microbiota exerted the opposite effects. A decrease in short-chain fatty acids, the intestinal microbiota-derived metabolites in the plasma-in particular, acetic acid and propionic acid-occurred after exposure to ZnONPs. It is important to note that supplementation with propionic acid, but not acetic acid, ameliorated ZnONP-induced ALI. We also showed that the source of inflammatory cytokines might partially be the infiltration of macrophages. Supplementation with propionic acid was found to act on macrophages through the receptor GPR43, because knockdown of GPR43 sharply reversed the protective effects of propionic acid during the ZnONP-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress in both primary alveolar macrophages and RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines. Altogether, a novel gut-lung axis mechanism is revealed in which intestinal microbiota and their derived metabolite propionic acid play protective roles against ZnONP-induced ALI and suggest that fecal microbiota transplantation and supplementation with propionic acid are potential remedy strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chitinase 3 like 1 contributes to the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling in pulmonary hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35951428/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1) is the prototypic chitinase-like protein mediating inflammation, cell proliferation, and tissue remodeling. Limited data suggest CHI3L1 is elevated in human pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and is associated with disease severity. Despite its importance as a regulator of injury/repair responses, the relationship between CHI3L1 and pulmonary vascular remodeling is not well understood. We hypothesize that CHI3L1 and its signaling pathways contribute to the vascular remodeling responses that occur in pulmonary hypertension (PH). We examined the relationship of plasma CHI3L1 levels and severity of PH in patients with various forms of PH, including group 1 PAH and group 3 PH, and found that circulating levels of serum CHI3L1 were associated with worse hemodynamics and correlated directly with mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. We also used transgenic mice with constitutive knockout and inducible overexpression of CHI3L1 to examine its role in hypoxia-, monocrotaline-, and bleomycin-induced models of pulmonary vascular disease. In all 3 mouse models of pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary hypertensive responses were mitigated in CHI3L1-null mice and accentuated in transgenic mice that overexpress CHI3L1. Finally, CHI3L1 alone was sufficient to induce pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation, inhibit pulmonary vascular endothelial cell apoptosis, induce the loss of endothelial barrier function, and induce endothelial-mesenchymal transition. These findings demonstrate that CHI3L1 and its receptors play an integral role in pulmonary vascular disease pathobiology and may offer a target for the treatment of PAH and PH associated with fibrotic lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selenium-enriched soybean peptides pretreatment attenuates lung injury in mice induced by fine particulate matters (PM2.5) through inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB/IκBα signaling pathway and inflammasome generation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35979800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to identify and prepare peptides from selenium (Se)-enriched soybeans and determine whether dietary Se-enriched soybean peptides (Se-SPep) could inhibit lung injury in mice induced by fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups. The mice in the prevention groups were pretreated with 378 mg kg-1 of Se-SPep, soybean peptides (SPep), and Se-enriched soybean protein (Se-SPro), respectively, for four weeks. The mice in the PM2.5 exposure group received concentrated PM2.5 (15 μg per day mice) for 1 h daily from the third week for two weeks. The results showed that the leukocyte and cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the PM2.5 exposure group were higher than those in the control group. Se-SPep pretreatment decreased the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels compared with the PM2.5 exposure group. Additionally, Se-SPep pretreatment inhibited TLR4/NF-κB/IκBα and NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 protein expression in the lungs. In conclusion, Se-SPep pretreatment may protect the lungs of the mice against PM2.5-induced inflammation, suggesting that Se-SPep represents a potential preventative agent to inhibit PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses exploit host cell machinery to support their replication. Defining the cellular proteins and processes required for a virus during infection is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of virally induced disease and designing host-directed therapeutics. Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screening in lung epithelial cells infected with the PR/8/NS1-GFP virus and use GFPhi cell as a unique screening marker to identify host factors that inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We discovered that APOE affects influenza virus infection both in vitro and in vivo. Cell deficiency in APOE conferred substantially increased susceptibility to IAV; mice deficient in APOE manifested more severe lung pathology, increased virus load, and decreased survival rate. Mechanistically, lack of cell-produced APOE results in impaired cell cholesterol homeostasis, enhancing influenza virus attachment. Thus, we identified a previously unrecognized role of APOE in restraining IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Csf2ra deletion attenuates acute lung injuries induced by intratracheal inoculation of aerosolized ricin in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36203597/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific therapeutics are not available for acute lung injury (ALI) induced by ricin toxin (RT). Inhibiting the host immune response in the course of pulmonary ricinosis is hypothesized to be of benefit and can be achieved by impairing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling, thereby reducing the pro-inflammatory response to exogenous foreign body invasion. However, it is unknown whether mice with impaired GM-CSF signaling can survive after RT inhalation. To test this, colony stimulating factor 2 receptor alpha (&lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt;) knockout (KO) mice that lack GM-CSF signaling and wild-type (WT) mice models of intratracheal exposure to a lethal dose (2× LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of RT were established. Survival was greater in &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice 21 days after RT inhalation compared with WT mice. Highly co-expressed genes that probably attenuated the pro-inflammatory response in the lung of &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice were identified. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that transcriptome changes involved mostly inflammation-related genes after RT exposure in both &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice and WT mice. However, the activity levels of pro-inflammatory pathways, such as the TNF signaling pathway and NF-κB signaling pathway, in &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice were significantly decreased and the degree of neutrophil chemotaxis and recruitment inhibited after RT-exposure relative to WT mice. RT-qPCR and flow cytometry validated results of RNA-Seq analysis. This work provides potential avenues for host-directed therapeutic applications that can mitigate the severity of ALI-induced by RT.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition Is Protective in Hyperoxia-Induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36193076/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Studies have linked severe hyperoxia, or prolonged exposure to very high oxygen levels, with worse clinical outcomes. This study investigated the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in hyperoxia-induced lung injury at very high oxygen levels (&amp;gt;95%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Effects of severe hyperoxia (100% oxygen) were studied in mice with genetically inhibited EGFR and wild-type littermates. Despite the established role of EGFR in lung repair, EGFR inhibition led to improved survival and reduced acute lung injury, which prompted an investigation into this protective mechanism. Endothelial EGFR genetic knockout did not confer protection. EGFR inhibition led to decreased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) and decreased terminal dUTP nick end labeling- (TUNEL-) positive staining in alveolar epithelial cells and reduced ERK activation, which suggested reduced apoptosis in vivo. EGFR inhibition decreased hyperoxia (95%)-induced apoptosis and ERK in murine alveolar epithelial cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and CRISPR-mediated EGFR deletion reduced hyperoxia-induced apoptosis and ERK in human alveolar epithelial cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In conditions of severe hyperoxia (&amp;gt;95% for &amp;gt;24 h), EGFR inhibition led to improved survival, decreased lung injury, and reduced cell death. These findings further elucidate the complex role of EGFR in acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work defines a protective role of EGFR inhibition to decrease apoptosis in lung injury induced by 100% oxygen. This further characterizes the complex role of EGFR in acute lung injury and outlines a novel hyperoxia-induced cell death pathway that warrants further study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFN-γ transforms the transcriptomic landscape and triggers myeloid cell hyperresponsiveness to cause lethal lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36203588/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory disease that is associated with high mortality but no specific treatment. Our understanding of initial events that trigger ARDS pathogenesis is limited. We have developed a mouse model of inflammatory lung injury by influenza and methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) coinfection plus daily antibiotic therapy. Using this pneumonic ARDS model, here we show that IFN-γ receptor signaling drives inflammatory cytokine storm and lung tissue damage. By single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, we demonstrate that IFN-γ signaling induces a transcriptional shift in airway immune cells, particularly by upregulating macrophage and monocyte expression of genes associated with inflammatory diseases. Further evidence from conditional knockout mouse models reveals that IFN-γ receptor signaling in myeloid cells, particularly CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mononuclear phagocytes, directly promotes TNF-α hyperproduction and inflammatory lung damage. Collectively, the findings from this study, ranging from cell-intrinsic gene expression to overall disease outcome, demonstrate that influenza-induced IFN-γ triggers myeloid cell hyperresponsiveness to MRSA, thereby leading to excessive inflammatory response and lethal lung damage during coinfection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protease-activated receptor 2 promotes clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection by inducing cAMP-Rac1 signaling in alveolar macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36204227/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient phagocytosis of pathogens by the innate immune system during infectious injury is vital for restoring tissue integrity. Impaired phagocytosis, such as in the case of infection with &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, a broad-spectrum antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterium, can lead to a life threatening lung disorder, acute lung injury (ALI). Evidence indicates that loss of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) impaired &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; clearance leading to non-resolvable ALI, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we focused on the alveolar macrophages (AMs), the predominant population of lung-resident macrophages involved in sensing bacteria, to understand their role in PAR2-mediated phagocytosis of &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. We found that upon binding &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, PAR2-expressing but not PAR2-null AMs had increased cAMP levels, which activated Rac1 through protein kinase A. Activated Rac1 increased actin-rich protrusions to augment the phagocytosis of &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. Administration of liposomes containing constitutively active Rac1 into PAR2-null mice lungs rescued phagocytosis and enhanced the survival of PAR2-null mice from pneumonia. These studies showed that PAR2 drives the cAMP-Rac1 signaling cascade that activates &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; phagocytosis in AMs, thereby preventing death from bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFN- γ Is Protective in Cytokine Release Syndrome-associated Extrapulmonary Acute Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms by which excessive systemic activation of adaptive T lymphocytes, as in cytokine release syndrome (CRS), leads to innate immune cell-mediated acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome, often in the absence of any infection, remains unknown. Here, we investigated the roles of IFN-γ and IL-17A, key T-cell cytokines significantly elevated in patients with CRS, in the immunopathogenesis of CRS-induced extrapulmonary ALI. CRS was induced in wild-type (WT), IL-17A- and IFN-γ knockout (KO) human leukocyte antigen-DR3 transgenic mice with 10 μg of the superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, given intraperitoneally. Several ALI parameters, including gene expression profiling in the lungs, were studied 4, 24, or 48 hours later. Systemic T-cell activation with staphylococcal enterotoxin B resulted in robust upregulation of several chemokines, S100A8/A9, matrix metalloproteases, and other molecules implicated in tissue damage, granulocyte as well as agranulocyte adhesion, and diapedesis in the lungs as early as 4 hours, which was accompanied by subsequent neutrophil/eosinophil lung infiltration and severe ALI in IFN-γ KO mice. These pathways were significantly underexpressed in IL-17A KO mice, which manifested mildest ALI and intermediate in WT mice. Neutralization of IFN-γ worsened ALI in WT and IL-17A KO mice, whereas neutralizing IL-17A did not mitigate lung injury in IFN-γ KO mice, suggesting a dominant protective role for IFN-γ in ALI and that IL-17A is dispensable. Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, increased ALI severity in WT mice. Thus, our study identified novel mechanisms of ALI in CRS and its differential modulation by IFN-γ and IL-17A.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant clinical complication with a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality, for which therapeutic options remain limited. The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway implicated in cell proliferation, dedifferentiation, and apoptosis via phosphorylation and inactivation of its downstream effectors Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Recent studies have revealed that the Hippo pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and repair of AKI. The Hippo pathway can mediate renal dysfunction through modulation of mitochondrial apoptosis under AKI conditions. Transient activation of YAP/TAZ in the acute phase of AKI may benefit renal recovery and regeneration, whereas persistent activation of YAP/TAZ in severe AKI may lead to maladaptive repair and transition to chronic kidney disease. This review aims to summarize recent findings on the associations between the Hippo pathway and AKI and to identify new therapeutic targets and strategies for AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of tocilizumab and dexamethasone on the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of antioxidants in the lungs in oleic acid-induced ARDS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36115998/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening disease caused by the induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs. There is a dearth of drug applications that can be used to prevent cytokine storms in ARDS treatment. This study was designed to investigate the effects of tocilizumab and dexamethasone on oxidative stress, antioxidant parameters, and cytokine storms in acute lung injury caused by oleic acid in rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Adult male rats were divided into five groups: the CN (healthy rats, n = 6), OA (oleic acid administration, n = 6), OA + TCZ-2 (oleic acid and tocilizumab at 2 mg/kg, n = 6), OA + TCZ-4 (oleic acid and tocilizumab at 4 mg/kg, n = 6), and OA + DEX-10 (oleic acid and dexamethasone at 10 mg/kg, n = 6) groups. All animals were euthanized after treatment for histopathological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, PCR, and SEM analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 cytokines in rats with acute lung injury induced by oleic acid were downregulated in the TCZ and DEX groups compared to the OA group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The MDA level in lung tissues was statistically lower in the OA + TCZ-4 group compared to the OA group. It was further determined that SOD, GSH, and CAT levels were decreased in the OA group and increased in the TCZ and DEX groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Histopathological findings such as thickening of the alveoli, hyperemia, and peribronchial cell infiltration were found to be similar when lung tissues of the TCZ and DEX groups were compared to the control group. With SEM imaging of the lung tissues, it was found that the alveolar lining layer had become indistinct in the OA, OA + TCZ-2, and OA + TCZ-4 groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In this model of acute lung injury caused by oleic acid, tocilizumab and dexamethasone were effective in preventing cytokine storms by downregulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. Against the downregulation of antioxidant parameters such as SOD and GSH in the lung tissues caused by oleic acid, tocilizumab and dexamethasone upregulated them and showed protective effects against cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liang-Ge decoction ameliorates acute lung injury in septic model rats through reducing inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and modulating host metabolism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36188538/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liang-Ge decoction (LG) has been used in the treatment of early stage of spesis and can ameliorate sepsis-associated lung injury. However, the mechanism of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury remains unknown. In this study, we established a rat model of sepsis-associated lung injury using the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method, and investigated the therapeutic effects of LG on lung injury in rats with sepsis. In addition, the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury model rats were evaluated. Besides, untargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the regulation of metabolites in rats with sepsis-associated lung injury after LG treatment. Our results showed that LG could decrease the wet/dry (W/D) ratio in lung and the total cell count and total protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in septic model rats. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining showed that LG reduced the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells in lung. In addition, LG treatmment down-regulated the gene and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokins in lung tissue and BALF. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were increased and the level of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) was decreased in lung tissue homogenate in septic model rats after LG treament. Moreover, the numbers of apoptotic cells in lung were reduced and the activity of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) in BALF was decreased in septic model rats after LG treament. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that LG treatment affected the levels of 23 metabolites in lung in septic model rats such as citric acid, methionine, threonine, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, and inositol, these metabolites were associated with the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism and citrate cycle (TCA cycle) pathways. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the therapeutic effetcts of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury model rats. Moreover, LG could inhibit the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis and regulate metabolites related to glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism and TCA cycle in lung in sepsis-associated lung injury model rats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Na/K-ATPase suppresses LPS-induced pro-inflammatory signaling through Lyn</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36072548/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1 interacts with TLR4 and SFKs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1 restricts LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice injected with LPS show more lung injury and lower survival rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na/K-ATPase (NKA), besides its ion transporter function, is a signal transducer by regulating Src family kinases (SFK). The signaling NKA contributes to oxidized LDL-induced macrophage foam cell formation and interacts with TLR4. However, its role in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced signaling and glycolytic switch in macrophages remains unclear. Using peritoneal macrophages from NKA α1 haploinsufficient mice (NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;), we found that NKA α1 haploinsufficiency led to enhanced LPS-stimulated NF-κB pathway, ROS signaling, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS resulted in more severe lung inflammation and injury with lower survival rate in NKA α1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Additionally, LPS induced a higher extent of the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Mechanistically, NKA α1 interacted with TLR4 and Lyn. The presence of NKA α1 in this complex attenuated Lyn activation by LPS, which subsequently restricted the downstream ROS and NF-κB signaling. In conclusion, we demonstrated that NKA α1 suppresses LPS-induced macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling through Lyn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rectal administration of butyrate ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis in mice through induction of hepatocyte growth factor in the colon via the HDAC-PPARγ pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36116532/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butyrate, given by oral administration or in drinking water, has been shown to improve experimental pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in mice despite of very low bioavailability. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics disconnection attracts us to explore its anti-PF mechanism in view of the intestinal expression of anti-PF factors. In bleomycin-induced PF in mice, rectal administration of butyrate (500 mg/kg) exhibited a significant anti-PF effect, with a maximum plasma concentration largely lower than the minimum effective concentration (1 mM) at which butyrate inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory factors by lung epithelial cells and the production of extracellular matrix by lung fibroblasts. The rectal administration of butyrate significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the colons of PF mice, but showed no significant effect on the mRNA expression of HGF in the small intestines, lungs and livers. In colon epithelial cells, the monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHC) abrogated butyrate-induced expression of HGF, indicating that butyrate functions through entering into cells. Butyrate showed no significant effect on the histone acetylation in the promoter region of HGF, suggesting that it promotes HGF expression not by directly affecting the histone deacetylation of HGF but by other pathways. GW9662, the inhibitor of PPARγ, significantly attenuated the effect of butyrate to promote the mRNA expression of HGF. Butyrate was able to enhance the acetylation of PPARγ, and a targeted mutation of lysine at the position 240 (K240) of PPARγ markedly diminished the induction of butyrate on HGF expression, suggesting that butyrate promoted HGF expression in colon epithelial cells by upregulating PPARγ K240 acetylation. In summary, rectal administration of butyrate promotes the expression of HGF in colonic epithelial cells through upregulating PPARγ acetylation via inhibition of HDAC activity. The findings of the present study provide a reasonable explanation for the anti-PF action mode of butyrate based on the &amp;rsquo;lung-gut axis&amp;rsquo;, and found that intestine-derived butyrate and HGF may be involved in the modulation of the occurrence and progression of PF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A potential new pathway for heparin treatment of sepsis-induced lung injury: inhibition of pulmonary endothelial cell pyroptosis by blocking hMGB1-LPS-induced caspase-11 activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36189354/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a significant cause of mortality in critically ill patients. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a leading cause of death in these patients. Endothelial cells exposed to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can progress into pyroptosis, a programmed lysis of cell death triggered by inflammatory caspases. It is characterized by lytic cell death induced by the binding of intracellular LPS to caspases 4/5 in human cells and caspase-11 in mouse cells. In mice,caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis plays an important role in endotoxemia. HMGB1 released into the plasma binds to LPS and is internalized into lysosomes in endothelial cells via the advanced glycation end product receptor. In the acidic lysosomal environment, HMGB1 permeates the phospholipid bilayer, which is followed by the leakage of LPS into the cytoplasm and the activation of caspase-11. Heparin is an anticoagulant widely applied in the treatment of thrombotic disease. Previous studies have found that heparin could block caspase-11-dependent inflammatory reactions, decrease sepsis-related mortality, and reduce ALI, independent of its anticoagulant activity. Heparin or modified heparin with no anticoagulant property could inhibit the alarmin HMGB1-LPS interactions, minimize LPS entry into the cytoplasm, and thus blocking caspase-11 activation. Heparin has been studied in septic ALI, but the regulatory mechanism of pulmonary endothelial cell pyroptosis is still unclear. In this paper, we discuss the potential novel role of heparin in the treatment of septic ALI from the unique mechanism of pulmonary endothelial cell pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astragaloside IV regulates the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to inhibit PM2.5-mediated lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36115280/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5-induced lung injury was associated with the ferroptosis and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV pre-treatment attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury by inhibiting ferroptosis via Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV is a potential drug for prevention of PM2.5-induced respiratory disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Exposure to PM2.5 will increase the risk of respiratory disease and increase the burden of social health care. Astragaloside Ⅳ (Ast-IV) is one of the main biologically active substances form Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus, which owns various pharmacological effects. Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by accumulation of iron-dependent lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is not clear whether there are typical features of ferroptosis in PM2.5-induced lung injury. This study investigates whether PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice has a special form of ferroptosis and the specific protective mechanism of Ast-IV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjects and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Forty-two male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 7 per group): NS group (normal saline), Ast group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg), PM2.5 group, Ast-L group (Ast-IV 50 mg/kg + PM2.5), Ast-H group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + PM2.5) and Era group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + erastin 20 mg/kg + PM2.5). Mice were pre-treated with Ast-IV intraperitoneally for three days. Then, PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) was given by non-invasive tracheal instillation to induce lung injury. The ferroptosis&amp;rsquo; agonist erastin was used to verify the mechanism of Ast-IV anti-ferroptosis. 12 h after PM2.5 stimulation, the mice were euthanized. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum were collected for oxidative stress and cytokine determination. Lung tissues were collected for glutathione (GSH), tissue iron content, histology, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Ast-IV reduced the lung wet-dry ratio and the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in serum. Ast-IV could also improve the oxidative stress level in BALF, restore the GSH level in the lung tissue, and reduce the iron content in the lung tissue. Western blot outcomes revealed that Ast-IV regulated the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to protect PM2.5-mediated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The protective effect of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice might be related to the inhibition of ferroptosis in lung tissue. Anti-ferroptosis might be a new mechanism of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>D-tagatose protects against oleic acid-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in rats by activating PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36189316/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier, resulting in severe alveolar edema and inflammation. D-tagatose (TAG) is a low-calorie fructose isomer with diverse biological activities whose role in ARDS has never been explored. We found that TAG protects lung tissues from injury in the oleic acid-induced rat model of ARDS. Seventeen male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups: Sham (n = 5), ARDS (n = 6), and TAG + ARDS (n = 6). The treatment groups were injected with oleic acid to induce ARDS, and the TAG + ARDS group was given TAG 3 days before the induction. After the treatments, the effect of TAG was evaluated by blood gas analysis and observing the gross and histological structure of the lung. The results showed that TAG significantly improved the oxygenation function, reduced the respiratory acidosis and the inflammatory response. TAG also improved the vascular permeability in ARDS rats and promoted the differentiation of alveolar type II cells, maintaining the stability of the alveolar structure. This protective effect of TAG on the lung may be achieved by activating the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, TAG protects against oleic acid-induced ARDS in rats, suggesting a new clinical strategy for treating the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting FoxO transcription factors with HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of osteoarthritis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36109140/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; Osteoarthritis (OA) features ageing-related defects in cellular homeostasis mechanisms in articular cartilage. These defects are associated with suppression of forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors. FoxO1 or FoxO3 deficient mice show early onset OA while FoxO1 protects against oxidative stress in chondrocytes and promotes expression of autophagy genes and the essential joint lubricant proteoglycan 4 (PRG4). The objective of this study was to identify small molecules that can increase FoxO1 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We constructed a reporter cell line with FoxO1 promoter sequences and performed high-throughput screening (HTS) of the Repurposing, Focused Rescue and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) library . Hits from the HTS were validated and function was assessed in human chondrocytes, meniscus cells and synoviocytes and following administration to mice. The most promising hit, the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) panobinostat was tested in a murine OA model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Among the top hits were HDACI and testing in human chondrocytes, meniscus cells and synoviocytes showed that panobinostat was the most promising compound as it increased the expression of autophagy genes and PRG4 while suppressing the basal and IL-1β induced expression of inflammatory mediators and extracellular matrix degrading enzymes. Intraperitoneal administration of panobinostat also suppressed the expression of mediators of OA pathogenesis induced by intra-articular injection of IL-1β. In a murine OA model, panobinostat reduced the severity of histological changes in cartilage, synovium and subchondral bone and improved pain behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Panobinostat has a clinically relevant activity profile and is a candidate for OA symptom and structure modification.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin ameliorates LPS-induced acute lung injury by maintenance of pulmonary microvascular barrier via activating the Epac1/AKT pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin alleviates LPS-induced pulmonary injury and edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin protects against PMVECs hyperpermeability via preventing the loss of adherens junctions and tight junctions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress by regulating mitochondrial function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin attenuates PMVECs barrier dysfunction via activating the Epac1/AKT signaling axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) barrier dysfunction is a main pathophysiological feature of sepsis-related acute lung injury (ALI). This study aimed to investigate whether the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor linagliptin could protect against LPS-induced PMVECs barrier disruption and its underlying molecular mechanisms. A classical ALI animal model and LPS-treated PMVECs were applied and all were treated with or without linagliptin. Cellular experiments demonstrated that linagliptin could mitigate LPS-induced PMVECs hyperpermeability and intercellular junction (VE-cadherin, β-catenin, and ZO-1) disruption in a dose-dependent manner. Correspondingly, it was observed that linagliptin pretreatment distinctly relieved LPS-induced lung injury, oxidative stress, and pulmonary edema in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of oxidative stress by linagliptin may be achieved by reversing impaired mitochondrial function. Mechanistically, linagliptin administration promoted the activation of the Epac1 pathway and its downstream AKT pathway, while inhibition of the Epac1/Akt signaling pathway significantly alleviated the above-mentioned protective effect of linagliptin on the PMVECs barrier. Taken together, these data suggest that linagliptin can effectively reserve PMVECs barrier dysfunction and inhibit oxidative stress to protect against ALI via activating the Epac1/AKT signaling pathway, and thus may become a potential clinical therapeutic strategy for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy plays a crucial role in the development and progression of ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the function and mechanism of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the regulation of autophagy in ischemic AKI remain unexplored. Herein, we find that circ-ZNF609, originating from the ZNF609 locus, is highly expressed in the kidney after ischemia/reperfusion injury, and urinary circ-ZNF609 is a moderate predictor for AKI in heart disease patients. Overexpression of circ-ZNF609 can activate AKT3/mTOR signaling and induce autophagy flux impairment and cell apoptosis while inhibiting proliferation in HK-2 cells, which is blocked by silencing circ-ZNF609. Mechanistically, circ-ZNF609 encodes a functional protein consisting of 250 amino acids (aa), termed ZNF609-250aa, the overexpression of which can activate AKT3/mTOR signaling and induce autophagy flux impairment and cell apoptosis in HK-2 cells in vitro and in AKI kidneys in vivo. The blockade of AKT and mTOR signaling with pharmacological inhibitors is capable of reversing ZNF609-250aa-induced autophagy flux impairment and cell apoptosis in HK-2 cells. The present study demonstrates that highly expressed circ-ZNF609-encoded ZNF609-250aa induces cell apoptosis and AKI by impairing the autophagy flux via an AKT/mTOR-dependent mechanism. These findings imply that targeting circ-ZNF609 may be a novel therapy for ischemic AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 exposure altered gut microbiome and influences the balance of Th17/Treg cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The changes of gut microbiome and the imbalance of Th17/Treg cell are critical mechanism of PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The administration of Probiotics regulating Th17/Treg cell balance and gut microbiome attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imbalance of intestinal microbiota and inflammatory response is crucial in the development of lung injury induced by PM2.5. In recent years, probiotics have attracted great attention for their health benefits in inflammatory diseases and regulating intestinal balance, but their intricate mechanisms need further experiments to elucidate. In our research, a rat lung damage model induced by PM2.5 exposure in real environment was established to explore the protective properties of probiotics on PM2.5 exposure injury and its related mechanism. The results indicated that compared with the AF control group, rats in the PM2.5 group gained weight slowly, ate less and had yellow hair. The results of pathological and immunohistochemical examinations showed that the inflammatory infiltration of lung tissue was alleviated after probiotic treatment. The Lung function results also showed the improvement effects of probiotics administration. In addition, probiotics could promote the balance of Th17 and Treg cells, inhibit cytokines expression (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17A), and increase the concentration of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10, TGF-β). In addition, 16 S rRNA sequence analysis showed that probiotic treatment could reduce microbiota abundance and diversity, increase the abundance of possible beneficial bacteria, and decrease the abundance of bacteria associated with inflammation. In general, probiotic intervention was found to have preventive effects on the occurrence of PM2.5 induced pathological injury, and the mechanism was associate with to the inhibition of inflammatory response, regulation of Th17/Treg balance and maintenance of intestinal internal environment stability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lack of ZNF365 Drives Senescence and Exacerbates Experimental Lung Fibrosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by aberrant activation of the alveolar epithelium, the expansion of the fibroblast population, and the accumulation of extracellular matrix. Global gene expression of human lung fibroblasts stimulated with TGFβ-1, a strong fibrotic mediator revealed the overexpression of ZNF365, a zinc finger protein implicated in cell cycle control and telomere stabilization. We evaluated the expression and localization of ZNF365 in IPF lungs and in the fibrotic response induced by bleomycin in WT and deficient mice of the orthologous gene &lt;em&gt;Zfp365&lt;/em&gt;. In IPF, ZNF365 was overexpressed and localized in fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and alveolar epithelium. Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis showed an upregulation of Zfp365 localized in lung epithelium and stromal cell populations. &lt;em&gt;Zfp365&lt;/em&gt; KO mice developed a significantly higher fibrotic response compared with WT mice by morphology and hydroxyproline content. Silencing &lt;em&gt;ZNF365&lt;/em&gt; in human lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells induced a significant reduction of growth rate and increased senescence markers, including Senescence Associated β Galactosidase activity, p53, p21, and the histone variant γH2AX. Our findings demonstrate that ZNF365 is upregulated in IPF and experimental lung fibrosis and suggest a protective role since its absence increases experimental lung fibrosis mechanistically associated with the induction of cell senescence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung transcriptome of nonhuman primates exposed to total- and partial-body irradiation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of radiation biodosimetry has changed recently, and a paradigm shift for using molecular technologies of omic platforms in addition to cytogenetic techniques has been observed. In our study, we have used a nonhuman primate model to investigate the impact of a supralethal dose of 12 Gy radiation on alterations in the lung transcriptome. We used 6 healthy and 32 irradiated animal samples to delineate radiation-induced changes. We also used a medical countermeasure, γ-tocotrienol (GT3), to observe any changes. We demonstrate significant radiation-induced changes in the lung transcriptome for total-body irradiation (TBI) and partial-body irradiation (PBI). However, no major influence of GT3 on radiation was noted in either comparison. Several common signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, GADD45, and p53, were upregulated in both exposures. TBI activated DNA-damage-related pathways in the lungs, whereas PTEN signaling was activated after PBI. Our study highlights the various transcriptional profiles associated with γ- and X-ray exposures, and the associated pathways include LXR/RXR activation in TBI, whereas pulmonary wound-healing and pulmonary fibrosis signaling was repressed in PBI. Our study provides important insights into the molecular pathways associated with irradiation that can be further investigated for biomarker discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Formyl Peptide Receptor 2 Activity in Hyperoxia-Induced Lung Injury in Newborn Mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formyl peptide receptor (FPR) 2 is known to play a critical role in regulating inflammation, including either the pro-inflammatory or pro-resolving effects. However, its role in neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury has not been delineated. In this study, we investigate whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attenuate hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury by regulating FPR2 activity. We observed a significant increase in FPR2 levels in alveolar macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) after H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced stress, which decreased after MSC treatment. In the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induction model, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α and TNF-α) were significantly reduced in RAW264.7 cells after treatment with WRW4, an inhibitor of FPR2, or MSCs. Viability of lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells was significantly improved when cultured in the conditioned media of RAW264.7 cells treated with WRW4 or MSCs, compared to when cultured in the conditioned media of control RAW265.7 cells exposed to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For the in vivo study, wild-type and FPR2 knockout (FPR2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) C57/BL6 mouse pups were randomly exposed to 80% oxygen or room air from postnatal day (P) 1 to P14. At P5, 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; MSCs were transplanted intratracheally. MSCs reduced the elevated FPR2 activity at P7 and improved the decreased FPR2 activity as well as the increased immuno-stained FPR2 activity in alveolar macrophages in hyperoxic lungs at P14. Both FPR&lt;sup&gt;2-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and MSCs similarly attenuated impaired alveolarization and angiogenesis, and increased apoptosis and inflammation of hyperoxic lungs without synergistic effects. Our findings suggest that the protective effects of MSCs in hyperoxic lung injury might be related to indirect modulation of FPR2 activity, at least of alveolar macrophages in neonatal mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Systemic interleukin-6 inhibition ameliorates acute neuropsychiatric phenotypes in a murine model of acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute neuropsychiatric impairments occur in over 70% of patients with acute lung injury. Mechanical ventilation is a well-known precipitant of acute lung injury and is strongly associated with the development of acute delirium and anxiety phenotypes. In prior studies, we demonstrated that IL-6 mediates neuropathological changes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of animals with mechanical ventilation-induced brain injury; however, the effect of systemic IL-6 inhibition on structural and functional acute neuropsychiatric phenotypes is not known. We hypothesized that a murine model of mechanical ventilation-induced acute lung injury (VILI) would induce neural injury to the amygdala and hippocampus, brain regions that are implicated in diverse neuropsychiatric conditions, and corresponding delirium- and anxiety-like functional impairments. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these structural and functional changes would reverse with systemic IL-6 inhibition. VILI was induced using high tidal volume (35 cc/kg) mechanical ventilation. Cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) expression was quantified as a neural injury marker and found to be significantly increased in the VILI group compared to spontaneously breathing or anesthetized and mechanically ventilated mice with 10 cc/kg tidal volume. VILI mice treated with systemic IL-6 inhibition had significantly reduced amygdalar and hippocampal CC3 expression compared to saline-treated animals and demonstrated amelioration in acute neuropsychiatric behaviors in open field, elevated plus maze, and Y-maze tests. Overall, these data provide evidence of a pathogenic role of systemic IL-6 in mediating structural and functional acute neuropsychiatric symptoms in VILI and provide preclinical justification to assess IL-6 inhibition as a potential intervention to ameliorate acute neuropsychiatric phenotypes following VILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Interplay between Aquaporin-1 and the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α in a Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Lung Injury Model in Human Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquaporin-1 (AQP1), a water channel, and the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A) are implicated in acute lung injury responses, modulating among others pulmonary vascular leakage. We hypothesized that the AQP1 and HIF1A systems interact, affecting mRNA, protein levels and function of AQP1 in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, the role of AQP1 in apoptosis and wound healing progression was examined. Both AQP1 mRNA and protein expression levels were higher in HPMECs exposed to LPS compared to untreated HPMECs. However, in the LPS-exposed &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt;-silenced cells, the mRNA and protein expression levels of AQP1 remained unaltered. In the permeability experiments, a statistically significant volume increase was observed at the 360 s time-point in the LPS-exposed HPMECs, while LPS-exposed &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt;-silenced HPMECs did not exhibit cell swelling, implying a dysfunctional AQP1. AQP1 did not seem to affect cell apoptosis yet could interfere with endothelial migration and/or proliferation. Based on our results, it seems that &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt; silencing negatively affects AQP1 mRNA and protein expression, as well as AQP1 function, in the setting of lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knockout of the Circadian Clock Protein PER1 (Period1) Exacerbates Hypertension and Increases Kidney Injury in Dahl Salt-Sensitive Rats</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Circadian rhythms play an essential role in physiological function. The molecular clock that underlies circadian physiological function consists of a core group of transcription factors, including the protein PER1 (Period1). Studies in mice show that PER1 plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure and renal sodium handling; however, the results are dependent on the strain being studied. Using male Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats with global knockout of PER1 (&lt;em&gt;SS&lt;sup&gt;Per1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), we aim to test the hypothesis that PER1 plays a key role in the regulation of salt-sensitive blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The model was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 and was characterized using radiotelemetry and measures of renal function and circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;SS&lt;sup&gt;Per1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats had similar mean arterial pressure when fed a normal 0.4% NaCl diet but developed augmented hypertension after three weeks on a high-salt (4% NaCl) diet. Despite being maintained on a normal 12:12 light:dark cycle, &lt;em&gt;SS&lt;sup&gt;Per1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats exhibited desynchrony mean arterial pressure rhythms on a high-salt diet, as evidenced by increased variability in the time of peak mean arterial pressure. &lt;em&gt;SS&lt;sup&gt;Per1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats excrete less sodium after three weeks on the high-salt diet. Furthermore, &lt;em&gt;SS&lt;sup&gt;Per1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats exhibited decreased creatinine clearance, a measurement of renal function, as well as increased signs of kidney tissue damage. &lt;em&gt;SS&lt;sup&gt;Per1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats also exhibited higher plasma aldosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Altogether, our findings demonstrate that loss of PER1 in Dahl SS rats causes an array of deleterious effects, including exacerbation of the development of salt-sensitive hypertension and renal damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pretreatment with rosavin attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats through antiferroptosis via PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36097321/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation and oxidative stress caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increase the incidence and mortality rates of respiratory disorders. Rosavin is the main chemical component of Rhodiola plants, which exerts anti-oxidative and antiinflammatory effects. In this research, the potential therapeutic effect of rosavin was investigated by the PM2.5-induced lung injury rat model. Rats were instilled with PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) suspension intratracheally, while rosavin (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) was delivered by intraperitoneal injection before the PM2.5 injection. It was observed that rosavin could prevent lung injury caused by PM2.5. PM2.5 showed obvious ferroptosis-related ultrastructural alterations, which were significantly corrected by rosavin. The pretreatment with rosavin downregulated the levels of tissue iron, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal, and increased the levels of glutathione. The expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was upregulated by rosavin, together with other ferroptosis-related proteins. RSL3, a specific ferroptosis agonist, reversed the beneficial impact of rosavin. The network pharmacology approach predicted the activation of rosavin on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. LY294002, a potent PI3K inhibitor, decreased the upregulation of Nrf2 induced by rosavin. In conclusion, rosavin prevented lung injury induced by PM2.5 stimulation and suppressed ferroptosis via upregulating PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SMPDL3b modulates radiation-induced DNA damage response in renal podocytes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36094323/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kidneys are radiosensitive and dose-limiting organs for radiotherapy (RT) targeting abdominal and paraspinal tumors. Excessive radiation doses to the kidneys ultimately lead to radiation nephropathy. Our prior work unmasked a novel role for the lipid-modifying enzyme, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3b (SMPDL3b), in regulating the response of renal podocytes to radiation injury. In this study, we investigated the role of SMPDL3b in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair in vitro and in vivo. We assessed the kinetics of DSBs recognition and repair along with the ATM pathway and nuclear sphingolipid metabolism in wild-type (WT) and SMPDL3b overexpressing (OE) human podocytes. We also assessed the extent of DNA damage repair in SMPDL3b knock-down (KD) human podocytes, and C57BL6 WT and podocyte-specific SMPDL3b-knock out (KO) mice after radiation injury. We found that SMPDL3b overexpression enhanced DSBs recognition and repair through modulating ATM nuclear shuttling. OE podocytes were protected against radiation-induced apoptosis by increasing the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and attenuating subsequent caspase-3 cleavage. SMPDL3b overexpression prevented radiation-induced alterations in nuclear ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and ceramide levels. Interestingly, exogenous C1P pretreatment radiosensitized OE podocytes by delaying ATM nuclear foci formation and DSBs repair. On the other hand, SMPDL3b knock-down, in vitro and in vivo, induced a significant delay in DSBs repair. Additionally, increased activation of apoptosis was induced in podocytes of SMPDL3b-KO mice compared to WT mice at 24 h post-irradiation. Together, our results unravel a novel role for SMPDL3b in radiation-induced DNA damage response. The current work suggests that SMPDL3b modulates nuclear sphingolipid metabolism, ATM nuclear shuttling, and DSBs repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tanshinone IIA loaded bioactive nanoemulsion for alleviation of lipopolysaccharide induced acute lung injury via inhibition of endothelial glycocalyx shedding</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36099790/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSIIA showed evident protective effects in acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nanoemulsion with bioactive excipients enhanced TSIIA activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSIIA alleviates endothelial glycocalyx shedding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endothelial glycocalyx is an important therapeutic target for acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSIIA effect may be attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more serious form; acute respiratory distress syndrome are major causes of COVID-19 related mortality. Finding new therapeutic targets for ALI is thus of great interest. This work aimed to prepare a biocompatible nanoformulation for effective pulmonary delivery of the herbal drug; tanshinone-IIA (TSIIA) for ALI management. A nanoemulsion (NE) formulation based on bioactive natural ingredients; rhamnolipid biosurfactant and tea-tree oil, was developed using a simple ultrasonication technique, optimized by varying oil concentration and surfactant:oil ratio. The selected TSIIA-NE formulation showed 105.7 nm diameter and a PDI ∼ 0.3. EE exceeded 98 % with biphasic sustained drug release and good stability over 3-months. In-vivo efficacy was evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model. TSIIA-NE (30 µg/kg) was administered once intratracheally 2 h after LPS instillation. Evaluation was performed 7days post-treatment. Pulmonary function assessment, inflammatory, oxidative stress and glycocalyx shedding markers analysis in addition to histopathological examination of lung tissue were performed. When compared to untreated rats, in-vivo efficacy study demonstrated 1.4 and 1.9-fold increases in tidal volume and minute respiratory volume, respectively, with 32 % drop in wet/dry lung weight ratio and improved levels of arterial blood gases. Lung histopathology and biochemical analysis of different biomarkers in tissue homogenate and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid indicated that treatment may ameliorate LPS-induced ALI symptoms thorough anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory effects and inhibition of glycocalyx degradation. TSIIA-NE efficacy was superior to free medication and blank-NE. The enhanced efficacy of TSIIA bioactive nanoemulsion significantly suggests the pharmacotherapeutic potential of bioactive TSIIA-NE as a promising nanoplatform for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An anticomplement homogeneous polysaccharide from Hedyotis diffusa attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury and inhibits neutrophil extracellular trap formation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36116199/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36116199/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Owing to the involvement of the overactivated complement system in acute lung injury (ALI) development, anticomplement components may attenuate ALI. Hedyotis diffusa is a traditional Chinese medicine for treating lung heat and its crude polysaccharides (HDP) exhibit significant anticomplement activity in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; To obtain an anticomplement homogeneous polysaccharide from HDP and verify its therapeutic effect and mechanism on ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Diethylaminoethyl-52 (DEAE-52) cellulose and gel permeation columns were used to isolate a homogeneous polysaccharide HD-PS-3, which was then characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and methylation analysis. In vitro, the anticomplement activities of HD-PS-3 through classical and alternative pathways were determined using a hemolytic test. The therapeutic effects of HDP and HD-PS-3 on ALI were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intratracheal instilled mice. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunohistochemical staining were used to assess histological changes, measure cytokine levels, and evaluate the degree of complement component 3c (C3c) deposition and neutrophil infiltration, respectively. ELISA, western blotting, and immunofluorescence were used to analyze neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; From HDP, 1.5 g of the homogeneous polysaccharide HD-PS-3 was obtained. HD-PS-3 was an acidic heteropolysaccharide with an acetyl group, which was composed of →4,6)-α-Glcp-(1→, →3,4)-α-Glcp-(1→, →4)-α-Glcp-(1→, →4,6)-α-Galp-(1→, →5)-α-Araf-(1→, α-Rhap-(1→, α-Araf-(1→, α-GlcpA-(1→, →4)-β-Manp-(1→, β-Manp-(1→ and →3)-β-Manp-(1→. The in vitro results suggest that HD-PS-3 exhibited anticomplement activity with CH50 and AP50 values of 115 ± 12 μg/ml and 307 ± 11 μg/ml, respectively. After confirming the efficacy of HDP (200 mg/kg) in attenuating lung injury, the effect of HD-PS-3 on ALI was also investigated. HD-PS-3 (75 and 150 mg/kg) attenuated LPS-induced ALI as well, evidenced by lung pathology, lung injury scores, protein concentration, leukocyte counts, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) contents in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Mechanistically, HD-PS-3 inhibited complement activation, manifested in reduced pulmonary C3c deposition in lung tissue and complement component 3a (C3a) content in BALF. Neutrophil recruitment was also reduced by HD-PS-3, with significantly reduced pulmonary neutrophil infiltration and lower levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in BALF. In addition, HD-PS-3 reduced the levels of MPO-DNA complex in BALF, decreased citrullinated histone H3 (Cit H3) expression and NET formation (colocalization of MPO, Cit H3, and DNA) in lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; An anticomplement homogeneous polysaccharide HD-PS-3 was isolated from H. diffusa. HD-PS-3 exhibited a therapeutic effect against ALI, and the mechanism might be related to its inhibitory effects on complement activation, neutrophil recruitment, and NET formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USP13 Deficiency Impairs Autophagy and Facilitates Age-related Lung Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150040/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an age-related disease. Failure of the proteostasis network with age, including insufficient autophagy, contributes to the pathology of IPF. Mechanisms underlying autophagy disruption in IPF are unclear and may involve regulation of USP (ubiquitin-specific protease) by post-translational modifications. To expand our previous observation of low USP13 expression in IPF, this study evaluated the role of USP13 in age-related lung fibrosis. Here, we demonstrated that &lt;em&gt;Usp13&lt;/em&gt;-deficient aged mice exhibited impaired autophagic activity and increased vulnerability to bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Mechanistically, USP13 interacted with and deubiquitinated Beclin 1, and Beclin 1 overexpression abolished the effects of USP13 disruption. In addition, Beclin 1 inhibition resulted in insufficient autophagy and more severe lung fibrosis after bleomycin injury, consistent with the phenotype of aged &lt;em&gt;Usp13&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice. Collectively, we show a protective role of USP13 in age-related pulmonary fibrosis. Aging-mediated USP13 loss impairs autophagic activity and facilitates lung fibrosis through Beclin 1 deubiquitination. Our findings support the notion that age-dependent dysregulation of autophagic regulators enhances vulnerability to lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>H1N1 influenza virus dose dependent induction of dysregulated innate immune responses and STAT1/3 activation are associated with pulmonary immunopathological damage</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36082929/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infection poses a substantial challenge and causes high morbidity and mortality. Exacerbated pulmonary inflammatory responses are the major causes of extensive diffuse alveolar immunopathological damage. However, the relationship between the extent of cytokine storm, neutrophils/macrophages infiltration, and different IAV infection dose and time still needs to be further elucidated, and it is still unclear whether the signal transduction and transcriptional activator 1/3 (STAT1/3) signalling pathway plays a beneficial or detrimental role. Here, we established a mouse model of high- and low-dose pH1N1 infection. We found that pH1N1 infection induced robust and early pathological damage and cytokine storm in an infection dose- and time-dependent manner. High-dose pH1N1 infection induced massive and sustained recruitment of neutrophils as well as a higher ratio of M1:M2, which may contribute to severe lung immunopathological damage. pH1N1 infection activated dose- and time-dependent STAT1 and STAT3. Inhibition of STAT1 and/or STAT3 aggravated low-dose pH1N1 infection, induced lung damage, and decreased survival rate. Appropriate activation of STAT1/3 provided survival benefits and pathological improvement during low-dose pH1N1 infection. These results demonstrate that high-dose pH1N1 infection induces robust and sustained neutrophil infiltration, imbalanced macrophage polarization, excessive and earlier cytokine storm, and STAT1/3 activation, which are associated with pulmonary dysregulated proinflammatory responses and progress of acute lung injury. The severe innate immune responses may be the threshold at which protective functions give way to immunopathology, and assessing the magnitude of host innate immune responses is necessary in adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy for alleviating influenza-induced pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>E-prostanoid 3 receptor deficiency on myeloid cells protects against ischemic acute kidney injury via breaking the auto-amplification loop of necroinflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36087809/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necroinflammation plays an important role in disease settings such as acute kidney injury (AKI). We and others have elucidated that prostaglandins, which are critically involved in inflammation, may activate E-prostanoid 3 receptor (EP3) at low concentrations. However, how EP3 blockade interacts with regulated cell death and affects AKI remains unknown. In this study, AKI was induced by ischemia-reperfusion (30 minutes/24 hours) in Ep3 knockout (&lt;em&gt;Ep3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), bone marrow chimeric, myeloid conditional EP3 knockout and corresponding control mice. The production of prostaglandins E2 and I2 was markedly increased after ischemia-reperfusion, and either abrogation or antagonism of EP3 ameliorated the injury. EP3 deficiency curbed inflammatory cytokine release, neutrophil infiltration and serum high-mobility group box 1 levels, but additional TLR4 inhibition with TAK-242 did not offer further protection against the injury and inflammation. The protection of &lt;em&gt;Ep3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was predominantly mediated by suppressing Mixed Lineage Kinase domain-Like-dependent necroptosis, resulting from the inhibition of cytokine generation and the switching of cell death modality from necroptosis to apoptosis through caspase-8 up-regulation, in part due to the restraint of IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling. EP3 deficiency failed to further alleviate the injury when necroptosis was inhibited. &lt;em&gt;Ep3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in bone marrow-derived cells, particularly that in myeloid cells, protected kidneys to the same extent as that of global EP3 deletion. Thus, our results demonstrate that EP3 deficiency especially that on myeloid cells, ameliorates ischemic AKI via curbing inflammation and breaking the auto-amplification loop of necroinflammation. Hence, EP3 may be a promising target for the prevention and/or treatment of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Injury-induced pulmonary tuft cells are heterogenous, arise independent of key Type 2 cytokines, and are dispensable for dysplastic repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36073526/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the lung bears significant regenerative capacity, severe viral pneumonia can chronically impair lung function by triggering dysplastic remodeling. The connection between these enduring changes and chronic disease remains poorly understood. We recently described the emergence of tuft cells within Krt5+ dysplastic regions after influenza injury. Using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, we characterized and delineated multiple distinct tuft cell populations that arise following influenza clearance. Distinct from intestinal tuft cells which rely on Type 2 immune signals for their expansion, neither IL-25 nor IL-4ra signaling are required to drive tuft cell development in dysplastic/injured lungs. In addition, tuft cell expansion occurred independently of type I or type III interferon signaling. Furthermore, tuft cells were also observed upon bleomycin injury, suggesting that their development may be a general response to severe lung injury. While intestinal tuft cells promote growth and differentiation of surrounding epithelial cells, in the lungs of tuft cell deficient mice, Krt5+ dysplasia still occurs, goblet cell production is unchanged, and there remains no appreciable contribution of Krt5+ cells into more regionally appropriate alveolar Type 2 cells. Together, these findings highlight unexpected differences in signals necessary for murine lung tuft cell amplification and establish a framework for future elucidation of tuft cell functions in pulmonary health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal microbiota metabolizing Houttuynia cordata polysaccharides in H1N1 induced pneumonia mice contributed to Th17/Treg rebalance in gut-lung axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus is intricately linked to dysregulation of gut microbiota and host immunity. Previous study revealed that Houttuynia cordata polysaccharides (HCP) exert the therapeutic effect on influenza A virus inducing lung and intestine damage via regulating pulmonary and intestinal mucosal immunity. However, whether this result was due to the regulation of gut microbiota in the gut-lung axis remains unclear. Here, we firstly found that the elimination of gut microbiota using antibiotic cocktails led to both loss of the protective effect of HCP on intestine and lung injury, and reduction of the efficacy on regulating Th17/Treg balance in gut-lung axis. Fecal microbiota transplantation study confirmed that the gut microbiota fermented with HCP under pathological conditions (H1N1 infection) was responsible for reducing pulmonary and intestinal injury. Moreover, the interaction of HCP and gut microbiota under pathological conditions exhibited not only much more abundant gut microbial diversity, but also higher content of the acetate. Our results demonstrated that the underlying mechanism to ameliorate viral pneumonia in mice involving Th17/Treg rebalance via the gut microbiota and HCP metabolite (acetate) metabolized in pneumonia mice. Our results provided a new insight for macromolecular polysaccharides through targeting intestinal microenvironment reducing distant pulmonary infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulator of calcineurin 1 deletion attenuates mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in acute kidney injury through JNK/Mff signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36071051/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced acute kidney injury (AKI), characterized by excessive mitochondrial damage and cell apoptosis, remains a clinical challenge. Recent studies suggest that regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) regulates mitochondrial function in different cell types, but the underlying mechanisms require further investigation. Herein, we aim to explore whether RCAN1 involves in mitochondrial dysfunction in AKI and the exact mechanism. In present study, AKI was induced by I/R and cisplatin in RCAN1flox/flox mice and mice with renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs)-specific deletion of RCAN1. The role of RCAN1 in hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) and cisplatin-induced injury in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2 was also examined by overexpression and knockdown of RCAN1. Mitochondrial function was assessed by transmission electron microscopy, JC-1 staining, MitoSOX staining, ATP production, mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay, Annexin V-FITC staining and Western blotting analysis of apoptosis-related proteins. It was found that protein expression of RCAN1 was markedly upregulated in I/R- or cisplatin-induced AKI mouse models, as well as in HR models in HK-2 cells. RCAN1 deficiency significantly reduced kidney damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell apoptosis, whereas RCAN1 overexpression led to the opposite phenotypes. Our in-depth mechanistic exploration demonstrated that RCAN1 increases the phosphorylation of mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) by binding to downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), then promotes dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) migration to mitochondria, ultimately leads to excessive mitochondrial fission of renal TECs. In conclusion, our study suggests that RCAN1 could induce mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis by activating the downstream JNK/Mff signaling pathway. RCAN1 may be a potential therapeutic target for conferring protection against I/R- or cisplatin-AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multimodal single cell sequencing implicates chromatin accessibility and genetic background in diabetic kidney disease progression</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proximal tubule is a key regulator of kidney function and glucose metabolism. Diabetic kidney disease leads to proximal tubule injury and changes in chromatin accessibility that modify the activity of transcription factors involved in glucose metabolism and inflammation. Here we use single nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to show that diabetic kidney disease leads to reduced accessibility of glucocorticoid receptor binding sites and an injury-associated expression signature in the proximal tubule. We hypothesize that chromatin accessibility is regulated by genetic background and closely-intertwined with metabolic memory, which pre-programs the proximal tubule to respond differently to external stimuli. Glucocorticoid excess has long been known to increase risk for type 2 diabetes, which raises the possibility that glucocorticoid receptor inhibition may mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of diabetic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections can compromise the physical and biological functionalities of humans and pose a huge economical and psychological burden on infected patients. Nitric oxide (NO) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, whose mechanism of action is not affected by bacterial resistance. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an endogenous donor and carrier of NO, has gained increasing attention because of its potent antibacterial activity and efficient biocompatibility. Significant breakthroughs have been made in the application of GSNO in biomaterials. This review is based on the existing evidence that comprehensively summarizes the progress of antimicrobial GSNO applications focusing on their anti-infective performance, underlying antibacterial mechanisms, and application in anti-infective biomaterials. We provide an accurate overview of the roles and applications of GSNO in antibacterial biomaterials and shed new light on the avenues for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to the key causative elements of neurological deficits. However, no effective therapeutics have been developed yet. In our previous work, extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) offered new insights as potential strategies for functional recovery of TBI. The current study aims to elucidate the mechanism of action, providing novel therapeutic targets for future clinical interventions. With the miRNA array performed and Real-time PCR validated, we revealed the crucial function of miR-330-5p transferred by SHED-derived EVs (SHED-EVs) in regulating microglia, the critical immune modulator in central nervous system. MiR-330-5p targeted Ehmt2 and mediated the transcription of CXCL14 to promote M2 microglia polarization and inhibit M1 polarization. Identified in our in vivo data, SHED-EVs and their effector miR-330-5p alleviated the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and resumed the motor functional recovery of TBI rats. In summary, by transferring miR-330-5p, SHED-EVs favored anti-inflammatory microglia polarization through Ehmt2 mediated CXCL14 transcription in treating traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosome from BMMSC Attenuates Cardiopulmonary Bypass-Induced Acute Lung Injury Via YAP/β-Catenin Pathway: Downregulation of Pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36063391/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) accompanied with systemic inflammatory response is an important complication after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Pyroptosis, which is induced by the secretion of inflammatory factors, has been implicated in ALI. However, recent studies have suggested that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMMSC-Exo) can ameliorate ALI, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Therefore, we aim to examine the effects of BMMSC-Exo in CPB-induced ALI, and its underlying mechanism. CPB rat models (male Sprague-Dawley rats) were administered BMMSC-Exo intravenously before induction of ALI. Lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and alveolar macrophage (AM) were collected after the treatments for further analysis, and rat AM NR8383 cells were used for in vitro study. HE staining was performed to detect macrophage infiltration. Western blot was used to detect related proteins expression. And ELISA assay was performed to investigate secretion of inflammatory factors. These results showed that BMMSC-Exo treatment ameliorated macrophage infiltration and oxidative stress, and downregulated expression of pyroptosis-related proteins, including NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, and GSDMD-N, in the lung tissue and AM, as well as decreased the secretion of IL-18 and IL-1β in BALF. Moreover, BMMSC-Exo activated YAP/β-catenin signaling pathway. Overall, these findings of this study indicated that BMMSC-Exo suppressed CPB-induced pyroptosis in ALI by activating YAP/β-catenin axis, which could be a novel strategy for lung protection during CPB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the cGAS-STING Pathway Attenuates Lung Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via Regulating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Alveolar Epithelial Type II Cells of Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36091334/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosol dsDNA sensor, coupling with downstream stimulator of interferon genes (STING) located in the ER, which involves innate immune responses. The aim of our present study was to investigate the effects of cGAS on lung I/R injury via regulating ERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used Sprague-Dawley rats to make the lung I/R model by performing left hilum occlusion-reperfusion surgery. cGAS-specific inhibitor RU.521, STING agonist SR-717, and 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), the ERS inhibitor, were intraperitoneally administered in rats. Double immunofluorescent staining was applied to detect the colocalization of cGAS or BiP, an ERS protein, with alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECIIs) marker. We used transmission electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructure of ER and mitochondria. Apoptosis and oxidative stress in the lungs were assessed, respectively. The profiles of pulmonary edema and lung tissue injury were evaluated. And the pulmonary ventilation function was measured using a spirometer system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In lung I/R rats, the cGAS-STING pathway was upregulated, which implied they were activated. After cGAS-STING pathway was inhibited or activated in lung I/R rats, the ERS was alleviated after cGAS was inhibited, while when STING was activated after lung I/R, ERS was aggravated in the AECIIs, these results suggested that cGAS-STING pathway might trigger ERS responses. Furthermore, activation of cGAS-STING pathway induced increased apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress via regulating ERS and therefore resulted in pulmonary edema and pathological injury in the lungs of I/R rats. Inhibition of cGAS-STING pathway attenuated ERS, therefore attenuated lung injury and promoted pulmonary ventilation function in I/R rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway attenuates lung ischemia/reperfusion injury via alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress in alveolar epithelial type II cells of rats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ischemia and reperfusion injury combined with cisplatin induces immunogenic cell death in lung cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36057637/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first-line chemotherapeutic drug for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), cisplatin (CDDP), fails to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) because it fails to induce calreticulin (CRT) exposure on the cell surface. We investigated the potential of ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R) combined with CDDP to induce ICD in lung cancer cells. The in vitro model of I/R, oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R), effectively induced CRT exposure, ATP secretion, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release and eIF2α phosphorylation in both Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and A549 cells when combined with CDDP. By using a vaccine assay and coculture with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), we showed that OGD/R restored the immunogenicity of CDDP by phosphorylating eIF2α and demonstrated that OGD/R + CDDP (O + C) is an ICD inducer. Using the inguinal tumor model, we found that I/R significantly enhanced the tumor-killing effect of CDDP and Mitomycin C, and this effect relied on adaptive antitumor immunity. Consistently, I + C altered the ratio of interferon-gamma-secreting T lymphocytes, thus overcoming the immunosuppressive effect induced by CDDP. In conclusion, our research presents a new combination strategy and indicates that I/R is a potential anticancer immunogenic modality when combined with nonimmunogenic chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Colivelin, a synthetic derivative of humanin, ameliorates endothelial injury and glycocalyx shedding after sepsis in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36119052/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-mediated multiple organ failure. Several clinical and experimental studies have suggested that the glycocalyx is an early target of endothelial injury during an infection. Colivelin, a synthetic derivative of the mitochondrial peptide humanin, has displayed cytoprotective effects in oxidative conditions. In the current study, we aimed to determine the potential therapeutic effects of colivelin in endothelial dysfunction and outcomes of sepsis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a clinically relevant model of polymicrobial sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and were treated with vehicle or colivelin (100-200 µg/kg) intraperitoneally at 1 h after CLP. We observed that vehicle-treated mice had early elevation of plasma levels of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and P-selectin, the angiogenetic factor endoglin and the glycocalyx syndecan-1 at 6 h after CLP when compared to control mice, while levels of angiopoietin-2, a mediator of microvascular disintegration, and the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, an enzyme implicated in clearance of endotoxins, raised at 18 h after CLP. The early elevation of these endothelial and glycocalyx damage biomarkers coincided with lung histological injury and neutrophil inflammation in lung, liver, and kidneys. At transmission electron microscopy analysis, thoracic aortas of septic mice showed increased glycocalyx breakdown and shedding, and damaged mitochondria in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Treatment with colivelin ameliorated lung architecture, reduced organ neutrophil infiltration, and attenuated plasma levels of syndecan-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α and interleukin-10. These therapeutic effects of colivelin were associated with amelioration of glycocalyx density and mitochondrial structure in the aorta. At molecular analysis, colivelin treatment was associated with inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase in the aorta and lung. In long-term outcomes studies up to 7 days, co-treatment of colivelin with antimicrobial agents significantly reduced the disease severity score when compared to treatment with antibiotics alone. In conclusion, our data support that damage of the glycocalyx is an early pathogenetic event during sepsis and that colivelin may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of sepsis-associated endothelial dysfunction.

      <title>CLEC5A is critical in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced NET formation and acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36048544/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most common nosocomial infections worldwide, and it frequently causes ventilator-associated acute pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Abundant neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to acute lung injury, thereby aggravating ventilator-induced lung damage. While pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) TLR4 and TLR5 are required for host defense against &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; invasion, the PRR responsible for &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced NET formation, proinflammatory cytokine release, and acute lung injury remains unclear. We found that myeloid C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A) interacts with LPS of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; and is responsible for &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced NET formation and lung inflammation. &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; activates CLEC5A to induce caspase-1-dependent NET formation, but it neither causes gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage nor contributes to &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced neutrophil death. Blockade of CLEC5A attenuates &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced NETosis and lung injury, and simultaneous administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb with ciprofloxacin increases survival rate and decreases collagen deposition in the lungs of mice challenged with a lethal dose of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, CLEC5A is a promising therapeutic target to reduce ventilator-associated lung injury and fibrosis in &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An ex vivo culture model of kidney podocyte injury reveals mechanosensitive, synaptopodin-templating, sarcomere-like structures</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney diseases are widespread and incurable. The biophysical mechanisms underlying them are unclear, in part because material systems for reconstituting the microenvironment of relevant kidney cells are limited. A critical question is how kidney podocytes (glomerular epithelial cells) regenerate foot processes of the filtration apparatus following injury. Recently identified sarcomere-like structures (SLSs) with periodically spaced myosin IIA and synaptopodin appear in injured podocytes in vivo. We hypothesized that SLSs template synaptopodin in the initial stages of recovery in response to microenvironmental stimuli and tested this hypothesis by developing an ex vivo culture system that allows control of the podocyte microenvironment. Results supported our hypothesis. SLSs in podocytes that migrated from isolated kidney glomeruli presented periodic synaptopodin-positive clusters that nucleated peripheral, foot process-like extensions. SLSs were mechanoresponsive to actomyosin inhibitors and substrate stiffness. Results suggest SLSs as mechanobiological mediators of podocyte recovery and as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms of Zedoary Turmeric Oil Injection against lipopolysaccharides-induced acute lung injury in rats elucidated by network pharmacology combined with transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36099655/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Prospects for the drug treatment of acute lung injury (ALI) is unpromising. Managing inflammation can prevent ALI from progressing and minimize further deterioration. Zedoary turmeric oil injection (ZTOI), a patented traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that has been used against ALI, has shown significant anti-inflammatory effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism by which ZTOI acts against ALI in rats using an ingredients-targets-pathways (I-T-P) interaction network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design and methods:&lt;/em&gt; The key ingredients of ZTOI were characterized using UPLC-MS/MS combined with literature mining. The target profiles of each ingredient were established using drug-target databases. The anti-inflammatory activity of ZTOI against lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced rat ALI was validated using histopathology and inflammatory factor assessments. The therapeutic targets of ZTOI were screened by integrating transcriptomic results of lung tissues with protein-protein interaction (PPI) expansion. Using KEGG pathway enrichment, an I-T-P network was established to determine the essential interactions among ingredients, targets, and pathways of ZTOI against lung inflammation in ALI. Molecular docking and immunofluorescence staining were utilized to confirm the accuracy of the I-T-P network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 11 sesquiterpenes, whose target profiles may characterize the potential function of ZTOI, were identified as key ingredients. In the ALI rat model, ZTOI can alleviate lung inflammation by decreasing the levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α both in serum and lung tissues. Based on our biological samples, transcriptomics, PPI network expansion, and KEGG pathway enrichment, 11 ingredients, 174 targets, and 8 signaling pathways were linked in the I-T-P networks. From these results, ZTOI could be inferred to exert multiple anti-inflammatory effects against ALI through Toll-like receptor, NF-kappa B, RIG-I-like receptor, TNF, NOD-like receptor, IL-17, MAPK, and the Toll and Imd signaling pathways. In addition, two significantly regulated targets in the transcriptome, Usp18 and Map3k7, could be the essential anti-inflammatory targets of ZTOI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; By integrating network pharmacology with ingredient identification and transcriptomics, we show the multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms by which ZTOI acts against ALI on an I-T-P level. This work also provides a methodological reference for related research into TCM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poldip2 knockdown protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via Nox4/Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36120334/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymerase δ-interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) has been reported to mediate acute lung injury (ALI); however, the underlying mechanism is not fully explored. Male C57BL/6 mice and A549 cells were used to establish the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model, then the expression of Poldip2 and its effect on oxidative stress and the resulting inflammation were detected. Adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) mediated Poldip2 knockdown was transfected into mice via intratracheal atomization. And A549 cells stimulated with LPS was used to further confirm our hypothesis in vitro. ML385, specifically inhibited the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Our data suggested that LPS stimulation remarkably increased protein levels of Nox4 and p-P65, activities of NADPH and MPO, and generation of ROS, TNF-α, and IL-1β while decreased protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 compared with those in NC shRNA + Saline group, which were obviously reversed by Poldip2 knockdown. Concomitantly, Poldip2 knockdown dramatically reduced contents of MDA and enhanced activities of SOD and GSH-Px compared to NC shRNA + LPS group. In vitro, we found that knockdown of Poldip2 significantly reversed LPS-induced increase protein levels of Nox4 and p-P65, activity of NADPH, and generation of ROS, TNF-α, and IL-1β, and decrease protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1, ML385 pretreatment reversed the effects of Poldip2 knockdown mentioned above. Our study indicated that Poldip2 knockdown alleviates LPS-induced ALI via inhibiting Nox4/Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diacerein attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ER stress and apoptosis: Impact on the crosstalk between SphK1/S1P, TLR4/NFκB/STAT3, and NLRP3/IL-1β signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36055546/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening clinical problem with high mortality rate and limited treatments or preventive options that represents a major challenge for clinicians. Diacerein (DIA) is a multi-target anthraquinone derivative with potent anti-inflammatory action. The aim of this study is to assess the protective effect of DIA and its potential molecular targets against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administrated DIA (50 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (5mg/kg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; DIA mitigated oxidative lung injury in LPS-challenged rats via significantly decreasing lung wet/dry (W/D) ratio, inflammatory cells infiltration, and lipid peroxidation, with concomitant elevation in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels in lung tissue. Likewise, DIA alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress and markedly halted inflammation triggered by LPS challenge in pulmonary tissue by suppressing NLRP3/IL-1β and TLR4/NF-κB signaling with parallel decrease in proinflammatory cytokine levels. Interestingly, DIA down regulated Sphk1/S1P axis, reduced GSK-3β and STAT3 proteins expression, and markedly decreased caspase-3 besides increasing Bcl-2 levels in lung tissue of LPS-challenged animals. These biochemical findings was simultaneously associated with marked improvement in histological alterations of lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; These findings verify the protective effect of DIA against LPS-induced ALI through targeting oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis. Importantly, DIA halted the hyperinflammatory state triggered by LPS via multi-faceted inhibitory effect on different signaling pathways, hence DIA could potentially reduce mortality in patients with ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel Requirement for Staphylococcal Cell Wall-Anchored Protein SasD in Pulmonary Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36040164/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; can complicate preceding viral infections, including influenza virus. A bacterial infection combined with a preceding viral infection, known as superinfection, leads to worse outcomes than a single infection. Most of the pulmonary infection literature focuses on the changes in immune responses to bacteria between homeostatic and virally infected lungs. However, it is unclear how much of an influence bacterial virulence factors have in single or superinfection. Staphylococcal species express a broad range of cell wall-anchored proteins (CWAs) that have roles in host adhesion, nutrient acquisition, and immune evasion. We screened the importance of these CWAs using mutants lacking individual CWAs in vivo in both bacterial pneumonia and influenza superinfection. In bacterial pneumonia, the lack of individual CWAs leads to various decreases in bacterial burden, lung damage, and immune infiltration into the lung. However, the presence of a preceding influenza infection partially abrogates the requirement for CWAs. In the screen, we found that the uncharacterized CWA &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; surface protein D (SasD) induced changes in both inflammatory and homeostatic lung markers. We further characterized a SasD mutant (sasD A50.1) in the context of pneumonia. Mice infected with sasD A50.1 have decreased bacterial burden, inflammatory responses, and mortality compared to wild-type &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;. Mice also have reduced levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), likely derived from macrophages. Reductions in IL-1β transcript levels as well as increased macrophage viability point at differences in cell death pathways. These data identify a novel virulence factor for &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; that influences inflammatory signaling within the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; is a common commensal bacterium that can cause severe infections, such as pneumonia. In the lung, viral infections increase the risk of staphylococcal pneumonia, leading to combined infections known as superinfections. The most common virus associated with &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; pneumonia is influenza, and superinfections lead to worse patient outcomes than either infection alone. While there is much known about how the immune system differs between healthy and virally infected lungs, the role of bacterial virulence factors in single and superinfection is less understood. The significance of our research is identifying bacterial components that play a role in the initiation of lung injury, which could lead to future therapies to prevent pulmonary single or superinfection with &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of immune response in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: far beyond the Th1/Th2 imbalance</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35983984/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease of unknown origin characterized by progressive scarring of the lung leading to irreversible loss of function. Despite the availability of two drugs that are able to slow down disease progression, IPF remains a deadly disease. The pathogenesis of IPF is poorly understood, but a dysregulated wound healing response following recurrent alveolar epithelial injury is thought to be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Areas covered:&lt;/em&gt; In the last few years, the role of the immune system in IPF pathobiology has been reconsidered; indeed, recent data suggest that a dysfunctional immune system may promote and unfavorable interplay with pro-fibrotic pathways thus acting as a cofactor in disease development and progression. In this article, we review and critically discuss the role of T cells in the pathogenesis and progression of IPF in the attempt to highlight ways in which further research in this area may enable the development of targeted immunomodulatory therapies for this dreadful disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expert opinion:&lt;/em&gt; A better understanding of T cell interactions has the potential to facilitate the development of immune modulators targeting multiple T cell-mediated pathways, thus halting disease initiation and progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcriptome analysis identifies IL24 as an autophagy modulator in PM2.5 caused lung dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36049333/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/36049333/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transcriptome analysis revealed the relationship between PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; exposure and autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; exposure led to lung pathological changes in mouse model via autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL24 was identified as a potential target associated with PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;-induced autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L24 was regulated by inhibition of mTOR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Evidence suggests that exposure to PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; increased hospitalization and mortality rates of respiratory diseases. However, the potential biomarkers and targets associated with PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;-induced lung dysfunction are not fully discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and HALLMARK enrichment analysis of the RNA-seq data (Beas-2B cells treated with PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;) were applied. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify the biological processes correlated with autophagy. Three gene expression profile datasets (GSE158954, GSE155616 and GSE182199) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify the potential targets. PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;-exposed mice were constructed. Real-time qPCR, siRNA transfection, western blot, immunofluorescence, and pathological staining were applied for validation both in vitro and in vivo studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; GO, KEGG and HALLMARK enrichment based on RNA-seq data showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were associated with autophagy like lysosome and macroautophagy. GSEA analysis revealed that PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; was positively correlated with autophagy-related biological processes compared with control group. Venn diagrams identified IL24 was upregulated in our data as well as in these three datasets (GSE158954, GSE155616 and GSE182199) after PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; exposure. Consistent with the analysis, activation of autophagy by PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; was validated in vivo and in vitro. In PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;-exposed mice, lung pathological changes were observed, including airway inflammation and mucus secretion. The mRNA and protein levels of the key gene, IL24, were significantly increased. Moreover, Bafilomycin A1, the inhibitor of autophagy, inhibited the autophagy and ameliorated lung injury induced by PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, downregulation of IL24 decreased autophagy activity. Meanwhile, IL24 was regulated by mTOR signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, we discovered a potential relationship between IL24 and autophagy during PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; exposure. IL24 might be a novel potential biomarker or therapeutic target in PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; caused lung dysfunction through regulation of autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung-Targeted Delivery of Cepharanthine by an Erythrocyte-Anchoring Strategy for the Treatment of Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36145566/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the most frequent complications of critical illness, acute lung injury (ALI) carries a high risk of clinical morbidity and mortality. Cepharanthine (CPA) has significant anti-inflammatory activity, however, due to poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and short half-life, it fails to provide effective clinical management measures. Here, we explored the flexibility of an erythrocyte-anchoring strategy using CPA-encapsulated chitosan-coating nanoparticles (CPA-CNPs) anchored onto circulating erythrocytes for the treatment of ALI. CPA-CNPs adhered to erythrocytes successfully (E-CPA-CNPs) and exhibited high erythrocyte adhesion efficiency (&amp;gt;80%). Limited toxicity and favorable biocompatibility enabled further application of E-CPA-CNPs. Next, the reticuloendothelial system evasion features were analyzed in RAW264.7 macrophages and Sprague-Dawley rats. Compared with bare CPA-CNPs, erythrocyte-anchored CNPs significantly decreased cellular uptake in immune cells and prolonged circulation time in vivo. Notably, the erythrocyte-anchoring strategy enabled CNPs to be delivered and accumulated in the lungs (up to 6-fold). In the ALI mouse model, E-CPA-CNPs attenuated the progression of ALI by inhibiting inflammatory responses. Overall, our results demonstrate the outstanding advantages of erythrocyte-anchored CPA-CNPs in improving the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of CPA, which offers great promise for a lung-targeted drug delivery system for the effective treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To explore the roles of macrophages&amp;rsquo; miR-217-5p in the process of PM2.5 induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; GEO database and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis as well as GSEA were used to predicted the miRNA and associated target signals. And then mice and RAW246.7 macrophages treated with PM2.5 to imitate PM2.5 induced acute lung injury environment and then transfected with miR-217-5p NC or miR-217-5p mimic. The levels of inflammatory factors TNF-α and anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 of mice serum were tested by ELISA. And the pathological changes and ROS level of mouse lung tissues were stained by HE and DHE staining. The proteins expression of phosphorylated-STAT1, total-STAT1, TNF-α, IFN-γ as well as p47, gp91, NOX4 in mice or RAW264.7 cells were tested by western blot or immunofluorescence of RAW264.7 cell slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results of bioinformatics analysis indicated the miR-217 as well as STAT1 were involved PM2.5 associated lung injury. After exposure to PM2.5, the decreased levels of serum TNF-α but not IL-10, consistent with reduced macrophages&amp;rsquo; accumulation as well as decreased ROS levels in lung tissues in miR-217-5p mimic group vs miR-217-5p NC group mice, and moreover, the protein expression levels of phosphorylated&amp;ndash;STAT1, total-STAT1, TNF-α, IFN-γ, p47, gp91 and NOX4 in mouse lung tissues and RTAW246.7 macrophages cells were all significantly reduced with miR-217-5p mimic administration. The above phenomena were reversed by specific STAT1-inhibitor HY-N8107.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; miR-217-5p suppressed the activated STAT1-signal induced inflammation and oxidative stress trigged by PM2.5 in macrophages and resulted in the decreased lung injure caused by PM2.5.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myeloid- and Epithelial-derived Heparin-Binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like Growth Factor Promotes Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36036796/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a poorly understood, progressive lethal lung disease with no known cure. In addition to alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injury and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, chronic inflammation is a hallmark of IPF. Literature suggests that the persistent inflammation seen in IPF primarily consists of monocytes and macrophages. Recent work demonstrates that monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (moAMs) drive lung fibrosis, but further characterization of critical moAM cell attributes is necessary. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is an important epidermal growth factor receptor ligand that has essential roles in angiogenesis, wound healing, keratinocyte migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Our past work has shown HB-EGF is a primary marker of profibrotic M2 macrophages, and this study seeks to characterize myeloid-derived HB-EGF and its primary mechanism of action in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis using &lt;em&gt;Hbegf&lt;sup&gt;f/f&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Lyz2Cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Here, we show that patients with IPF and mice with pulmonary fibrosis have increased expression of HB-EGF and that lung macrophages and transitional AECs of mice with pulmonary fibrosis and humans all express HB-EGF. We also show that &lt;em&gt;Hbegf&lt;sup&gt;f/f&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Lyz2Cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice are protected from bleomycin-induced fibrosis and that this protection is likely multifactorial, caused by decreased CCL2-dependent monocyte migration, decreased fibroblast migration, and decreased contribution of HB-EGF from AEC sources when HB-EGF is removed under the Lyz2Cre promoter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatic fibrosis occurs in response to prolonged tissue injury in the liver, which results in abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have been suggested to play a major role in liver fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), an NAD+ -dependent deacetylase, has been previously implicated in the regulation of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-SMAD3 pathway that plays a significant role in liver fibrosis. In this work, we aimed to identify other important players during hepatic fibrogenesis, which are modulated by SIRT6. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ or WWTR1), key players in the Hippo pathway, have been implicated in the promotion of hepatic fibrosis. Our data show that HSC-specific Sirt6 knockout mice are more susceptible to high-fat-cholesterol-cholate diet-induced hepatic fibrosis than their wildtype counterparts. Our signaling analyses suggest that in addition to the TGFβ-SMAD3 pathway, YAP and TAZ are also highly activated in the SIRT6-deficient HSCs. As it is not clear how SIRT6 might regulate YAP and TAZ, we have decided to elucidate the mechanism underlying the regulation of YAP and TAZ by SIRT6 in HSCs. Overexpression or knockdown of SIRT6 corroborates the role of SIRT6 in the negative regulation of YAP and TAZ. Further biochemical analyses reveal that SIRT6 deacetylates YAP and TAZ and reprograms the composition of the TEA domain transcription factor complex to suppress their downstream target genes, particularly those involved in hepatic fibrosis. In conclusion, our data suggest that SIRT6 plays a critical role in the regulation of the Hippo pathway to protect against hepatic fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vitamin D protects silica particles induced lung injury by promoting macrophage polarization in a KLF4-STAT6 manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36049670/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicosis is one of the severest occupational diseases worldwide, manifesting as infiltration of inflammatory cells, excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and pulmonary diffuse fibrosis. Macrophages polarization to M2 is one of the major strategies that attenuates inflammatory response. Our previous study found that vitamin D could protect against silica-induced lung injury by damping the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here we further identified that vitamin D attenuated silica particles-induced lung inflammation by regulating macrophage polarization in a KLF4-STAT6 manner. Myeloid-specific Stat6 knockout (cKO) mice were generated for in vivo studies. Primary macrophages purified from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of wildtype or Stat6 cKO mice and differentiated THP-1 cells were used for in vitro studies. Vitamin D was found to promote alveolar macrophage polarizing to M2 phenotype through the STAT6 signaling pathway, as demonstrated by worse lung inflammation and ablated protection of vitamin D in silica particles-instilled Stat6 cKO mice. Mechanismly, vitamin D upregulated KLF4 expression in the alveolar macrophage, which synergistically activated STAT6. Additionally, KLF4 was found to upregulate macrophages autophagy, which protected them from silica particles-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. The protective effects of vitamin D were dismissed by silencing KLF4. Our study demonstrates the potential mechanism of vitamin D-mediated macrophage polarization and reveals the therapeutic application of vitamin D in inflammatory disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anti-Fibrotic Effect of SDF-1β Overexpression in Bleomycin-Injured Rat Lung</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36145551/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rational:&lt;/em&gt; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease and is associated with high mortality due to a lack of effective treatment. Excessive deposition of the extracellular matrix by activated myofibroblasts in the alveolar space leads to scar formation that hinders gas exchange. Therefore, selectively removing activated myofibroblasts with the aim to repair and remodel fibrotic lungs is a promising approach. Stromal-derived growth factor (SDF-1) is known to stimulate cellular signals which attract stem cells to the site of injury for tissue repair and remodeling. Here, we investigate the effect of overexpression of SDF-1β on lung structure using the bleomycin-injured rat lung model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Intratracheal administration of bleomycin was performed in adult male rats (F344). Seven days later, in vivo electroporation-mediated gene transfer of either SDF-1β or the empty vector was performed. Animals were sacrificed seven days after gene transfer and histology, design-based stereology, flow cytometry, and collagen measurement were performed on the tissue collected. For in vitro experiments, lung fibroblasts obtained from IPF patients were used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Seven days after SDF-1β gene transfer to bleomycin-injured rat lungs, reduced total collagen, reduced collagen fibrils, improved histology and induced apoptosis of myofibroblasts were observed. Furthermore, it was revealed that TNF-α mediates SDF-1β-induced apoptosis of myofibroblasts; moreover, SDF-1β overexpression increased alveolar epithelial cell numbers and proliferation in vivo and also induced their migration in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study demonstrates a new antifibrotic mechanism of SDF-1β overexpression and suggests SDF-1β as a potential new approach for the treatment of lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil extracellular traps-triggered impaired autophagic flux via METTL3 underlies sepsis-associated acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36030287/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) assist pathogen clearance, while excessive NETs formation is associated with exacerbated inflammatory responses and tissue injury in acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Autophagy is generally considered to be a protective process, but autophagy dysfunction is harmful. Whether and how NETs affect autophagic flux during sepsis-induced ALI are currently unknown. Here, we confirmed that the level of NETs was increased in ARDS patients and mice models, which led to impairment of autophagic flux and deterioration of the disease. Mechanistically, NETs activated METTL3 mediated m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation of Sirt1 mRNA in alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in abnormal autophagy. These findings provide new insights into how NETs contribute to the development of sepsis-associated ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influenza virus causes lung immunopathology through down-regulating PPARγ activity in macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36091002/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatal influenza (flu) virus infection often activates excessive inflammatory signals, leading to multi-organ failure and death, also referred to as cytokine storm. PPARγ (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonists are well-known candidates for cytokine storm modulation. The present study identified that influenza infection reduced PPARγ expression and decreased PPARγ transcription activity in human alveolar macrophages (AMs) from different donors. Treatment with PPARγ agonist Troglitazone ameliorated virus-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion but did not interfere with the IFN-induced antiviral pathway in human AMs. In contrast, PPARγ antagonist and knockdown of PPARγ in human AMs further enhanced virus-stimulated proinflammatory response. In a mouse model of influenza infection, flu virus dose-dependently reduced PPARγ transcriptional activity and decreased expression of PPARγ. Moreover, PPARγ agonist troglitazone significantly reduced high doses of influenza infection-induced lung pathology. In addition, flu infection reduced PPARγ expression in all mouse macrophages, including AMs, interstitial macrophages, and bone-marrow-derived macrophages but not in alveolar epithelial cells. Our results indicate that the influenza virus specifically targets the PPARγ pathway in macrophages to cause acute injury to the lung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plasma Cell-Free DNA Predicts Survival and Maps Specific Sources of Injury in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36004627/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a noninvasive marker of cellular injury. Its significance in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Plasma cfDNA was measured in 2 PAH cohorts (A, n=48; B, n=161) and controls (n=48). Data were collected for REVEAL 2.0 (Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management) scores and outcome determinations. Patients were divided into the following REVEAL risk groups: low (≤6), medium (7-8), and high (≥9). Total cfDNA concentrations were compared among controls and PAH risk groups by 1-way analysis of variance. Log-rank tests compared survival between cfDNA tertiles and REVEAL risk groups. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were estimated from logistic regression models. A sample subset from cohort B (n=96) and controls (n=16) underwent bisulfite sequencing followed by a deconvolution algorithm to map cell-specific cfDNA methylation patterns, with concentrations compared using t tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In cohort A, median (interquartile range) age was 62 years (47-71), with 75% female, and median (interquartile range) REVEAL 2.0 was 6 (4-9). In cohort B, median (interquartile range) age was 59 years (49-71), with 69% female, and median (interquartile range) REVEAL 2.0 was 7 (6-9). In both cohorts, cfDNA concentrations differed among patients with PAH of varying REVEAL risk and controls (analysis of variance _P_≤0.002) and were greater in the high-risk compared with the low-risk category (_P_≤0.002). In cohort B, death or lung transplant occurred in 14 of 54, 23 of 53, and 35 of 54 patients in the lowest, middle, and highest cfDNA tertiles, respectively. cfDNA levels stratified as tertiles (log-rank: &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.0001) and REVEAL risk groups (log-rank: &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) each predicted transplant-free survival. The addition of cfDNA to REVEAL improved discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.72-0.78; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.02). Compared with controls, methylation analysis in patients with PAH revealed increased cfDNA originating from erythrocyte progenitors, neutrophils, monocytes, adipocytes, natural killer cells, vascular endothelium, and cardiac myocytes (Bonferroni adjusted &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). cfDNA concentrations derived from erythrocyte progenitor cells, cardiac myocytes, and vascular endothelium were greater in patients with PAH with high-risk versus low-risk REVEAL scores (_P_≤0.02).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Circulating cfDNA is elevated in patients with PAH, correlates with disease severity, and predicts worse survival. Results from cfDNA methylation analyses in patients with PAH are consistent with prevailing paradigms of disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Urinary profile of PAHs and related compounds in women working in beauty salons</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36029813/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36029813/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First survey of urinary PAHs, 1-OHP and TTMA levels in women working in beauty salons;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High PAHs, 1-OHP and TTMA levels were detected in urine of beauticians after the work shift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The urinary PAHs, 1-OHP and TTMA were correlated with “personal care products (PCPs) usage”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some PAHs were associated with oxidative stress/kidney injury biomarkers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beauty activities can be considered as a major source of PAHs, 1-OHP and TTMA exposures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of chemical compounds which interest to human biological monitoring researches because of their potential carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic properties. However, the exposure of female beauticians to these contaminants is not well-reported. For biomonitoring of potential exposure of female cosmeticians to PAHs in beauty salons, urine samples were taken from cosmetologist women (n = 50.00) and housewives (n = 35.00) as the exposure group (EG) and control group (CG), respectively. Next, unmetabolized PAHs levels as well as the concentration of - 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) were analyzed in these specimens. In addition, since benzene has some common source with PAHs, in this study t, t&amp;rsquo;-Muconic acid (TTMA) level was also determined as the metabolite and indicator of exposure to benzene. The results indicated a high detection frequency of the target compounds (PAHs, 1-OHP and TTMA) in the urine specimens of beauticians. The results also showed that there is a significant difference between the concentration of these pollutants in the urine specimens of the exposure and control groups. The median concentration of ΣPAHs, 1-OHP, and TTMA in the before exposure (BE) specimens collected from the exposure group were 337.42 ng/L, 593.92 ng/L, and 247.90 μg/L, respectively. However, a higher concentration of these contaminants was observed in the after exposure specimens with a median concentration of 423.29 ng/L, 745.03 ng/L, and 310.97 μg/L, respectively. In terms of contribution of PAHs compounds in total toxic equivalents, DahA, BaP, and IndP with 59.03, 28.73, and 2.86 % had the largest share. In this study, it was also observed that some kidney damage biomarkers as well as some oxidative stress injury biomarkers are positively and significantly correlated with the urinary values of ∑PAHs. Thus, it can be concluded that high health risks threaten the female beauticians regarding kidney injury and DNA oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Assessing the Global Impact on the Mouse Kidney After Traumatic Brain Injury: A Transcriptomic Study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36042866/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we use animal models combined with bioinformatics strategies to investigate the potential changes in overall renal transcriptional expression after traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Microarray analysis was performed after kidney acquisition using unilateral controlled cortical impact as the primary mouse TBI model. Multi-oriented gene set enrichment analysis was performed for differentially expressed genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that TBI affected the gene set associated with mitochondria function in kidney cells, and a negative enrichment of gene sets associated with immune cell migration and epidermal development was also observed. Analysis of the disease phenotype gene set revealed that differential expression of mitochondria-related genes was associated with lactate metabolism. Alternatively, activation and adhesion of immune cells associated with the complement system may promote autoinflammation in kidney tissue. The simulated immune cell infiltration analysis showed an increase in the proportion of activated memory CD4 T cells and a decrease in the proportion of resting memory CD4 T cells, suggesting that activated memory CD4 T cell infiltration may be involved in the inflammation of renal tissue and cause damage to renal cells, such as principal cells, mesangial cells and loops of Henle cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study is the first to reveal the effects of brain trauma on the kidney. TBI may affect the expression of mitochondria function-related gene sets in renal cells by increasing lactate. It may also affect renal mesangial cells by inducing increased infiltration of immune cells through mechanisms related to complement system activation or autoimmune antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cephalosporins-induced intestinal dysbiosis exacerbated pulmonary endothelial barrier disruption in streptococcus pneumoniae-infected mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36093187/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic abuse is growing more severe in clinic, and even short-term antibiotic treatment can cause long-term gut dysbiosis, which may promote the development and aggravation of diseases. Cephalosporins as the broad-spectrum antibiotics are widely used for prevention and treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in children. However, their potential consequences in health and disease have not been fully elaborated. In this study, the effects of cefaclor, cefdinir and cefixime on intestinal microbiota and lung injury were investigated in &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; (Spn)-infected mice. The results showed that the proportion of coccus and bacillus in intestinal microbiota were changed after oral administration with cefaclor, cefdinir and cefixime twice for 10 days, respectively. Compared with the Spn-infected group, the proportion of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; in intestine were significantly reduced, while Enterococcus and Candida was increased after cephalosporin treatment. Furthermore, 3 cephalosporins could obviously increase the number of total cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes in BALF as well as the serum levels of endotoxin, IL-2, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Mechanically, cephalosporins accelerated Spn-induced pulmonary barrier dysfunction via mediating the mRNA expressions of endothelial barrier-related proteins (Claudin 5, Occludin, and ZO-1) and inflammation-related proteins (TLR4, p38 and NF-κB). However, all of those consequences could be partly reversed by &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium bifidum&lt;/em&gt; treatment, which was closely related to the elevated acetate production, indicating the protective effects of probiotic against antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that oral administration with cephalosporins not only disrupted intestinal microecological homeostasis, but also increased the risk of Spn infection, resulting in severer respiratory inflammation and higher bacterial loads in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intermittent fasting attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice by modulating macrophage polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028098/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a spectrum of acute and life-threatening pulmonary inflammatory conditions. Treatment of ALI remains a clinical challenge. Recently, intermittent fasting (IF) has been shown to improve health and alleviate many diseases. In this study, we tested whether IF attenuated ALI and investigated the mechanism underlying this process. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, the effects of IF on ALI were evaluated in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine ALI model. We found that two times of 24-h fasting in a week before ALI efficiently ameliorated LPS-induced lung injury in mice, characterized by alleviated lung lesions, wet-to-dry weight ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde content, and lower levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, functional assays were conducted to assess IF on the inflammatory response and macrophage polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with LPS or IL-4. And PPARγ antagonist GW9662 and AMPK siRNA were used to test the role of PPARγ and AMPK in the IF-mediated improvement of ALI. The results showed that IF (serum deprivation) suppressed macrophage M1 activation and promoted M2 activation in LPS-treated BMDMs. While, IF also augmented macrophage M2 polarization in IL-4-treated BMDMs. Further mechanistic studies showed that the promotive effect of IF on M2 polarization was related to the activation of the PPARγ and AMPK pathways. In conclusion, this study suggests that IF enhances M2 polarization by activating the AMPK and PPARγ pathways, thus facilitating anti-inflammatory response and ameliorating ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is a pathological process that occurs in numerous organs throughout the human body and is frequently associated with severe cellular damage and death. Puerarin is an isoflavone compound extracted from the root of Pueraria lobata and has pharmacological effects such as dilating cerebral vessels and anti-free radical generation in cerebral ischemic tissues. With the deepening of experimental research and clinical research on puerarin, it has been found that puerarin has a protective effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of the heart, brain, spinal cord, lung, intestine and other organs. In summary, puerarin has a vast range of pharmacological effects and significant protective effects, and it also has obvious advantages in the clinical protection of patients with organ IRI. With the deepening of experimental pharmacological research and clinical research, it is expected to be an effective drug for IRI treatment. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the protective effect of puerarin on I/R organ injury and its possible underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pyrogallol enhances therapeutic effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells against LPS-mediated inflammation and lung injury via activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028178/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenges in clinical applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attributed to their heterogeneity. It is believed that preconditioning of MSCs with active compounds may enhance the expression of potentially therapeutic molecules and thus achieve stable and effective therapeutic outcomes. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which pyrogallol increased the therapeutic efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) against LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI). hUCMSCs with pyrogallol treatment increased expression of HO-1 at both mRNA and protein levels, accompanied by Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1 (Keap1) degradation, and upregulation of the Nrf2 protein levels as well as nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Moreover, the modulation of Keap1 and Nrf2 as well as HO-1 upregulation by pyrogallol was reversed by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and a P38 kinase inhibitor (SB203580). Whereas, NAC pretreatment abrogated pyrogallol-mediated activation of P38 kinase, indicating that pyrogallol-derived ROS led to P38 kinase activation, thus promoting Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Additionally, we found that the induction of p62 by the pyrogallol-mediated ROS/P38/Nrf2 axis interacted with Keap1 and resulted in autophagic degradation of Keap1, which created a positive feedback loop to further release of Nrf2. Furthermore, the increased expression of HO-1 in pyrogallol-pretreated hUCMSCs led to enhanced inhibitory effects on LPS-mediated TLR4/P-P65 signaling in BEAS-2B cells, resulting in increasing suppression of LPS-indued expression of a series of pro-inflammatory mediators. Compared to untreated hUCMSCs, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with pyrogallol-primed hUCMSCs transplantation showed enhanced improvements in LPS-mediated lung pathological alterations, the increased lung index (lung/body ratio), apoptosis of epithelial cells, the activation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling as well as the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Together, these results suggested that hUCMSCs with pyrogallol pretreatment enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSCs, which may provide a promising therapeutic strategy to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSC-based therapy for treating LPS-associated ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury and concomitant apoptosis induction via ROS-mediated ER stress is efficaciously counteracted by epigallocatechin gallate</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028100/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhabdomyolysis induced acute kidney injury (RIAKI) is a life-threatening condition responsible for approximately 19-58% of AKI cases worldwide. We performed an intramuscular injection of glycerol (10 mL/kg) in male wistar rats to induce AKI. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was administered for 3 consecutive days to evaluate its protective effects. We observed significant downregulation in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and LDH at different time points on EGCG treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, H&amp;amp;E staining also revealed that EGCG was able to reduce the formation of damaged tubules and tubular necrosis which was prominently spread throughout the kidney tissue of glycerol treatment group. Concomitantly, we observed upregulated inflammation, ER stress and elevated oxidative stress in the glycerol treated group only, which was significantly normalized upon EGCG treatment in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The occurrence of apoptosis in kidney tubules was found to be relatively higher in glycerol treated group and H2O2 treated HEK-293 cells. The results obtained after EGCG treatment revealed a significant decrease in apoptotic cell population, which was further validated by immunofluorescence staining against p53 and comet assay in HEK-293 cells and p53 IHC in kidney tissues. Western blotting also revealed a systemic downregulation of intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway markers such as bax, bcl-2, pro and cleaved caspase 3, caspase 9 and PARP1. Additionally, the results for flow cytometry analysis and TUNEL assay corroborated apoptotic equilibrium. Conclusively, we reckon EGCG as a multi-therapeutic natural product that can be used the for treatment of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generation of Plvap-CreER and Car4-CreER for genetic targeting of distinct lung capillary populations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been reported recently that there are two distinct subpopulations of capillary endothelial cells in the mammalian lungs: gCap (general capillary) and aCap (aerocyte). They are identified by two unique markers, respectively: plasmalemmal vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP) and carbonic anhydrase IV (CAR4). Here, we report two novel knock-in mouse lines Plvap-CreER and Car4-CreER, which genetically target gCap and aCap, respectively. Induced by tamoxifen, the Plvap-CreER and Car4-CreER alleles mediate specific and efficient Cre-loxP recombinations in PLVAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gCap and CAR4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; aCap, respectively, in the lungs. These two mouse lines are useful genetic tools to investigate cell fates and functions of PLVAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CAR4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in lung homeostasis, injury and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simultaneous Monitoring of HOCl and Viscosity with Drug-Induced Pyroptosis in Live Cells and Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35998356/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis is a newly identified form of cell death that is closely correlated with many diseases. Recent studies have indicated that the inflammation in pyroptosis would accelerate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, intracellular viscosity is another key microenvironmental parameter that reflects many physiological and pathological states in the early stage, hypochlorous acid (HOCl), as an important ROS, also plays significant roles in a variety of pathologies. However, the fluctuation of viscosity and HOCl in the process of pyroptosis is still unknown. Herein, we present a dual-responsive fluorescent probe (Lyso-VH) for simultaneously detecting viscosity and HOCl. Lyso-VH was successfully used to image the fluctuation of HOCl and viscosity in the lysosome of three kinds of cells with dependent and independent channels. Moreover, Lyso-VH can be employed to investigate the changes of HOCl and viscosity during the process of pyroptosis in living cells and acute lung injury (ALI). Thus, this work can not only serve as a powerful tool to simultaneously visualize the fluctuation of HOCl and viscosity in lysosomes, but also provide a new insight into drug-induced pyroptosis in living cells and acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligent nanomedicines integrated with stimuli-responsive components enable on-demand customizable treatment options which would improve therapeutic outcome and reduce systemic toxicity. In this work, we explore the synergistic therapeutic potential of photodynamic therapy and immunometabolic modulation to achieve tumour regression and to trigger an adaptive immunity to prevent tumour recurrence. The therapeutic potential of the fabricated Bioengineered Immunomodulatory Organelle targeted Nanozymes (BIONs) was tested on 3D printed mini-brains which could effectively recapitulate the biologically relevant interactions between glioblastoma cells and macrophages. In the presence of glioblastoma organotypic brain slices, activated BIONs upregulated the cell surface expression of CD86, a costimulatory molecule and CD83, maturation marker, on monocyte derived dendritic cells, suggesting its ability to elicit a strong immune response. Furthermore, the antigen pulsed dendritic cells by chemotaxis and transendothelial migration readily relocate into the draining lymph node where they present the antigenic cargo to enable the proliferation of T lymphocytes. The stealth and tunable catalytic activity of BIONs prevent ROS mediated diseases such as acute kidney injury by providing environment dependent protection without compromising on its promising anti-cancer activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blocking CHOP-dependent TXNIP shuttling to mitochondria attenuates albuminuria and mitigates kidney injury in nephrotic syndrome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albuminuria is the hallmark of nephrotic syndrome (NS), a leading cause of chronic kidney disease affecting 500 million people worldwide. Thus, there is a clear need to discover novel drug targets to treat proteinuric kidney disease. We demonstrate that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a redox protein that forms the complex with antioxidant oxidoreductase thioredoxin (Trx), relocates from nucleus to mitochondria when C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a major endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated transcription factor, is induced by albuminuria. TXNIP shuttling to mitochondria is essential for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which oxidizes mitochondrial-specific Trx2 and disrupts the association between Trx2-TXNIP and Trx2-ASK1 in mitochondria, leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Thus, TXNIP is a potential target to treat NS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albuminuria is a hallmark of glomerular disease of various etiologies. It is not only a symptom of glomerular disease but also a cause leading to glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and eventually, a decline in kidney function. The molecular mechanism underlying albuminuria-induced kidney injury remains poorly defined. In our genetic model of nephrotic syndrome (NS), we have identified CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein)-TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting protein) as critical molecular linkers between albuminuria-induced ER dysfunction and mitochondria dyshomeostasis. TXNIP is a ubiquitously expressed redox protein that binds to and inhibits antioxidant enzyme, cytosolic thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), and mitochondrial Trx2. However, very little is known about the regulation and function of TXNIP in NS. By utilizing &lt;em&gt;Chop&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Txnip&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice as well as &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-Galuminox, our molecular imaging probe for detection of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo, we demonstrate that CHOP up-regulation induced by albuminuria drives TXNIP shuttling from nucleus to mitochondria, where it is required for the induction of mitochondrial ROS. The increased ROS accumulation in mitochondria oxidizes Trx2, thus liberating TXNIP to associate with mitochondrial nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) to activate inflammasome, as well as releasing mitochondrial apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) to induce mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Importantly, inhibition of TXNIP translocation and mitochondrial ROS overproduction by CHOP deletion suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation and p-ASK1-dependent mitochondria apoptosis in NS. Thus, targeting TXNIP represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effect of invasive mechanical ventilation on the diversity of the pulmonary microbiota</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary microbial diversity may be influenced by biotic or abiotic conditions (e.g., disease, smoking, invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), etc.). Specially, invasive MV may trigger structural and physiological changes in both tissue and microbiota of lung, due to gastric and oral microaspiration, altered body posture, high O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation-induced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; toxicity in hypoxemic patients, impaired airway clearance and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which in turn reduce the diversity of the pulmonary microbiota and may ultimately lead to poor prognosis. Furthermore, changes in (local) O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration can reduce the diversity of the pulmonary microbiota by affecting the local immune microenvironment of lung. In conclusion, systematic literature studies have found that invasive MV reduces pulmonary microbiota diversity, and future rational regulation of pulmonary microbiota diversity by existing or novel clinical tools (e.g., lung probiotics, drugs) may improve the prognosis of invasive MV treatment and lead to more effective treatment of lung diseases with precision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Increased expression and accumulation of GDF15 in IPF extracellular matrix contribute to fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35993367/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease of unmet medical need. It is characterized by formation of scar tissue leading to a progressive and irreversible decline in lung function. IPF is associated with repeated injury, which may alter the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we demonstrate that IPF patient-derived pulmonary ECM drives profibrotic response in normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) in a 3D spheroid assay. Next, we reveal distinct alterations in composition of the diseased ECM, identifying potentially novel associations with IPF. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) was identified among the most significantly upregulated proteins in the IPF lung-derived ECM. In vivo, GDF15 neutralization in a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model led to significantly less fibrosis. In vitro, recombinant GDF15 (rGDF15) stimulated α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression in NHLF, and this was mediated by the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) receptor. Furthermore, in the presence of rGDF15, the migration of NHLF in collagen gel was reduced. In addition, we observed a cell type-dependent effect of GDF15 on the expression of cell senescence markers. Our data suggest that GDF15 mediates lung fibrosis through fibroblast activation and differentiation, implicating a potential direct role of this matrix-associated cytokine in promoting aberrant cell responses in disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting Myocardial Mitochondria-STING-Polyamine Axis Prevents Cardiac Hypertrophy in Chronic Kidney Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36061341/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitochondrial damage is early and prominent in cardiomyocytes under CKD milieu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitochondrial damage stimulates myocardial STING-NFκB pathway to drive hypertrophy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFκB transactivates ODC1-PUT metabolic flux in cardiomyocytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ODC1-PUT metabolic flux is required for STING/NFκB-driven cardiac hypertrophy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting mitochondria-STING-ODC1 axis prevents cardiac hypertrophy in CKD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is well recognized as a distinct contributor to cardiac hypertrophy, while the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, the authors show that myocardial mitochondrial oxidative damage is early and prominent in CKD and distinctively stimulates the STING-NFκB pathway by releasing mitochondrial DNA to drive cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, the authors reveal that ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1)-putrescine metabolic flux is transactivated by NFκB and is required for the STING-NFκB pathway to drive cardiac hypertrophy. Finally, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the myocardial mitochondria-STING-NFκB-ODC1 axis significantly prevents CKD-associated cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, targeting the myocardial mitochoandria-STING-NFκB-ODC1 axis is a promising therapeutic strategy for cardiac hypertrophy in patients with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rno_circRNA_008646 regulates formaldehyde induced lung injury through Rno-miR-224 mediated FOXI1/CFTR axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct exposure to formaldehyde can cause lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircRNAs involvement in formaldehyde-induced lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rno_circRNA_008646 contributed to formaldehyde induced lung injury through rno-miR-224 mediated FOXI1/CFTR axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formaldehyde (FA) serves as a prevailing air pollutant, which has seriously threatened public health in recent years. Of all the known health effects, lung injury is one of the most severe risks. However, little is known about the circRNAs related molecular mechanism in the development of lung injury induced by FA. This study was designed to explore the potential roles of dysregulated circRNAs as well as its mechanism in FA-induced lung injury. In the present study, 24 male SD rats were exposed to formaldehyde (control, 0.5, 2.46 and 5 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for 8 h per day for 8 weeks to induce lung injury. We used H&amp;amp;E staining to evaluate the histopathological changes of lung injury indifferent groups. The expression of circRNAs in lung tissue was detected by real-time PCR. Meanwhile, circRNA/miRNA/mRNA interaction networks were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Our study revealed that formaldehyde exposure resulted in abnormal histopathological changes in lung tissues. Moreover, the expression of rno_circRNA_008646 was significantly higher in lung tissues of formaldehyde exposure rats than in control. Bioinformatics analysis showed that one potential target miRNA/mRNA for rno_circRNA_008646 was rno-miR-224/Forkhead Box I1 (FOXI1). Besides, luciferase report gene confirmed that there was targeted binding relationship between rno_circRNA_008646 and rno-miR-224, rno-miR-224 and FOXI1. Further verification experiments indicated that the expression of rno_circRNA_008646 was negatively correlated rno-miR-224, while it was positively correlated with FOXI1. JASPAR database showed transcription factor FOXI1 located in promotor of CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). Both FOXI1 and CFTR were up-regulated in lung tissues after formaldehyde exposure. In conclusion, our findings suggested that formaldehyde may induce lung injury, and this may be caused by up-regulatedrno_circRNA_008646, which medicated rno-miR-224/FOXI1/CFTR axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immune-mediated tubule atrophy promotes acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease transition</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35986026/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incomplete repair after acute kidney injury can lead to development of chronic kidney disease. To define the mechanism of this response, we compared mice subjected to identical unilateral ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury with either contralateral nephrectomy (where tubule repair predominates) or contralateral kidney intact (where tubule atrophy predominates). By day 14, the kidneys undergoing atrophy had more macrophages with higher expression of chemokines, correlating with a second wave of proinflammatory neutrophil and T cell recruitment accompanied by increased expression of tubular injury genes and a decreased proportion of differentiated tubules. Depletion of neutrophils and T cells after day 5 reduced tubular cell loss and associated kidney atrophy. In kidney biopsies from patients with acute kidney injury, T cell and neutrophil numbers negatively correlated with recovery of estimated glomerular filtration rate. Together, our findings demonstrate that macrophage persistence after injury promotes a T cell- and neutrophil-mediated proinflammatory milieu and progressive tubule damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the cardiac fibroblast-enriched histone methyltransferase Dot1L prevents cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35986422/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition that contributes to compromised cardiac function and potentially heart failure. Disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (Dot1L) is the catalytic enzyme required for histone H3K79 methylation which has been demonstrated to play a role in transcriptional activation. However, the functions of Dot1L in the process of cardiac fibrosis still remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In the present study, we found that endogenous Dot1L is upregulated in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) treated with angiotensin II (Ang II) or transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, along with elevated extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fibronectin, collagen I and III. Silencing or inhibiting Dot1L mitigated Ang II-induced myofibroblast generation and fibrogenesis. We identified the transcription factor-forkhead box O (FoxO) 3a as a novel substrate of Dot1L, the transcriptional activating mark H3K79me3 level on the promoter of FoxO3a was increase in activated-CFs, and inhibition of Dot1L markedly decreased FoxO3a transcription accompanied by a significant decrease in the expression of fibrogenic gene. Knockdown of FoxO3a could alleviate ECM deposition induced by Ang II, on the contrary, overexpression FoxO3a resulting in CFs activation. Consistently, in vivo Dot1L ablation rescued myocardial ischemia-induced cardiac fibrosis and improved cardiac function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings conclude that upregulation of Dot1L results in activation of the cardiac fibroblasts to promote profibrotic gene, eventually causes cardiac fibrosis. Pharmacological targeting for Dot1L might represent a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of human cardiac fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antioxidant mitoquinone ameliorates EtOH-LPS induced lung injury by inhibiting mitophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36059543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic ethanol abuse is a systemic disorder and a risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. One explanation is that ethanol produces damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disturbs the balance of mitochondria within the lungs to promote a pro-injury environment. We hypothesized that targeting an antioxidant to the mitochondria would prevent oxidative damage and attenuate EtOH-LPS-induced lung injury. To test this, we investigated the effects of mitochondria-targeted ubiquinone, Mitoquinone (MitoQ) on ethanol-sensitized lung injury induced by LPS. Lung inflammation, ROS, mitochondria function, and mitophagy were assessed. We demonstrated that chronic ethanol feeding sensitized the lung to LPS-induced lung injury with significantly increased reactive oxygen species ROS level and mitochondrial injury as well as lung cellular NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These deleterious effects were attenuated by MitoQ administration in mice. The protective effects of MitoQ are associated with decreased cellular mitophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Taken together, our results demonstrated that ethanol aggravated LPS-induced lung injury, and antioxidant MitoQ protects from EtOH-LPS-induced lung injury, probably through reducing mitophagy and protecting mitochondria, followed by NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results will provide the prevention and treatment of ethanol intake effects with new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eupalinolide B attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury through inhibition of NF-κB and MAPKs signaling by targeting TAK1 protein</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35988521/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eupalinolide B (EB) inhibit LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EB directly binds to TAK1, and inhibits NF-κB and MAPKs activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The α,γ-unsaturated lactone of EB is vital for its anti-inflammatory effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease characterized by severe inflammatory response, which has no pharmacological therapy in clinic. In this study, we found that eupalinolide B (EB), a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Eupatorium lindleyanum, significantly ameliorated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice, which manifests as reduction in lung injury score, activity of myeloperoxidase, and release of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In RAW264.7 murine macrophages, EB effectively inhibited LPS-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by down-regulating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), respectively. Mechanistically, EB not only blocked LPS-induced phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase-α/β (IKKα/β), phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B alpha (IκBα), and phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) P65, but also suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Through cellular thermal shift assay and western blotting, EB was demonstrated to target and inactivate transforming growth factor β activated kinase-1 (TAK1), which is an important upstream kinase for the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs pathways. Additionally, EB-mediated actions were markedly abolished by dithiothreitol in LPS-exposed RAW264.7 cells, suggesting a crucial role of the α,γ-unsaturated lactone for the anti-inflammatory activity of EB. In conclusion, our findings showed that EB could effectively alleviate ALI in mice, and attenuate inflammatory response by inhibiting the activation of TAK1, and TAK1-mediated activation of NF-κB and MAPKs cascades.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is commonly accompanied by a severe inflammatory reaction process, and effectively managing inflammatory reactions is an important therapeutic approach for alleviating ALI. Macrophages play an important role in the inflammatory response, and this role is proinflammatory in the early stages of inflammation and anti-inflammatory in the late stages. Oxypeucedanin is a natural product with a wide range of pharmacological functions. This study aimed to determine the effect of oxypeucedanin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the following experiments were performed based on LPS-induced models &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Using myeloperoxidase activity measurement, ELISA, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting, we found that oxypeucedanin modulated the activity of myeloperoxidase and decreased the expression levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, MPO, COX-2 and iNOS in LPS-induced inflammation models. Meanwhile, oxypeucedanin inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT and its downstream NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, oxypeucedanin significantly decreased the pulmonary vascular permeability, which was induced by LPSs, and the enhanced expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin and Claudin 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of oxypeucedanin is associated with the inhibition of the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways and the maintenance of the integrity of the lung air-blood barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that poses a major challenge in critical care medicine. The development of ALI/ARDS involves excessive inflammatory response, and macrophage autophagy plays an important role in regulating the inflammatory response in ALI/ARDS. In this paper, we review the effects of autophagy in regulating macrophage function, discuss the roles of macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS, and highlight drugs and other interventions that can modulate macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS to improve the understanding of the mechanism of macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS and provide new ideas and further research directions for the treatment of ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Puerarin ameliorates acute lung injury by modulating NLRP3 inflammasome-induced pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35977927/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We commenced to analyze putative anti-pyroptosis effects of puerarin (PU) as mediated by the PP2A-HDAC1-NLRP3 pathway in acute lung injury (ALI). ALI animal and cell models were constructed, followed by treatment of PU. Then, the effect of HDAC1, PP2A, and NLRP3 on cell inflammation and pyroptosis was explored. The interaction between HDAC1 and PP2A as well as between PP2A and NLRP3 was analyzed. Our findings suggested that PU downregulated HDAC1 expression to alleviate symptoms of ALI. HDAC1 overexpression promoted inflammation induced by LPS, which reversed the inhibitory effect of PU on ALI. HDAC1 overexpression also decreased PP2A expression, suggesting that PP2A was involved in the effects of HDAC1 on LPS-induced inflammation. PP2A exerted inhibitory effects on NLRP3. Meanwhile, PU hindered the progression of ALI by silencing HDAC1 or overexpressing PP2A both in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, PU restrained pyroptosis of cells induced by NLRP3 inflammasome to abate ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor Progression Locus 2 Protects against Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Influenza A Virus-Infected Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35980186/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation in patients with severe influenza disease may lead to acute lung injury that results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is associated with alveolar damage and pulmonary edema that severely impair gas exchange, leading to hypoxia. With no existing FDA-approved treatment for ARDS, it is important to understand the factors that lead to virus-induced ARDS development to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We have previously shown that mice deficient in the serine-threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase, Tpl2 (MAP3K8 or COT), succumb to infection with a typically low-pathogenicity strain of influenza A virus (IAV; HKX31, H3N2 [x31]). The goal of the current study was to evaluate influenza A virus-infected &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice clinically and histopathologically to gain insight into the disease mechanism. We hypothesized that &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice succumb to IAV infection due to development of ARDS-like disease and pulmonary dysfunction. We observed prominent signs of alveolar septal necrosis, hyaline membranes, pleuritis, edema, and higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the lungs of IAV-infected &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice from 7 to 9 days postinfection (dpi). Notably, WT mice showed signs of regenerating epithelium, indicative of repair and recovery, that were reduced in &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Furthermore, biomarkers associated with human ARDS cases were upregulated in &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice at 7 dpi, demonstrating an ARDS-like phenotype in &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice in response to IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the protective role of the serine-threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase, Tpl2, in influenza virus pathogenesis and reveals that host Tpl2 deficiency is sufficient to convert a low-pathogenicity influenza A virus infection into severe influenza disease that resembles ARDS, both histopathologically and transcriptionally. The IAV-infected &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mouse thereby represents a novel murine model for studying ARDS-like disease that could improve our understanding of this aggressive disease and assist in the design of better diagnostics and treatments.

      <title>Vitamin-D ameliorates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via augmenting miR-149-5p and downregulating ER stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35988833/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury is a life-threatening medical problem induced by sepsis or endotoxins and may be associated with enhanced Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Vitamin-D (Vit-D) possesses an anti-inflammatory effect; however, this specific mechanism on acute lung injury is still unknown. Here we scrutinize the mechanism of Vit-D on Acute lung injury (ALI) models and explored the Vit-D augmented miRNA&amp;rsquo;s role in regulating the ER stress pathway in ALI. Sepsis was induced by CLP, and Endotoxemia was caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that Vit-D alleviates pulmonary edema, improves lung histoarchitecture, infiltration of neutrophils, endothelial barrier in mice, and improves ER stress markers Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) and CHOP (C/EBP Homologous Protein) expression elevated by CLP/LPS induce ALI. Vit-D decreases the nitric oxide production and ATF6 in macrophages induced by LPS. Vit-D augments miR (miR-149-5p) in LPS-induce macrophages, CLP, and LPS-induced ALI models. Vit-D enhanced miRNA-149-5p when overexpressed, inhibited ER-specific ATF6 inflammatory pathway in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and improved histoarchitecture of the lung in LPS/CLP-induced mice models. This vitro and vivo studies demonstrate that Vit-D could improve ALI induced by CLP/LPS. In this regard, miR-149-5p may play a crucial role in vitamin-D inhibiting LPS/CLP induce ALI. The mechanism might be an association of increased miR-149-5p and its regulated gene target ATF6, and downstream CHOP proteins were suppressed. Thus, these findings demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory effect of Vit-D is achieved by augmentation of miRNA-149-5p expression, which may be a key physiologic mediator in the prevention and treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acadesine alleviates acute pancreatitis-related lung injury by mediating the barrier protective function of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35987144/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretreatment with acadesine shows therapeutic potential SAP-ALI in vivo and vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endothelial injury is critical for the initiation and progression of severe acute pancreatitis-related acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The beneficial effects of acadesine may involve reducing ROS accumulation and inhibiting apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acadesine inhibits the impairment of SAP-ALI by activating the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a condition characterized by highly fatal acute inflammation and is usually associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Acute lung injury (ALI) is the most common complications of SAP, which is the accelerator of other organ dysfunction caused by SAP and the primary cause of early death due to SAP. Acadesine, an adenosine analog and an AMPK activator, has been discovered to modulate glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS. However, its role in SAP-ALI and its mechanism remains unclear and need to be explored. Herein, we discovered that acadesine mitigated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), alleviated apoptosis and recovered barrier integrity, thereby contributing to anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Nrf2 deficiency partially eliminated the effects of acadesine-induced antioxidant effects and thus weakened the protective effects on cells and Nrf2-knockout (Nrf2&lt;Sup&gt;-/-&lt;/Sup&gt;) mice. This study demonstrates that acadesine attenuated SAP-ALI associated inflammation and tissue damage by modulating the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway by triggering AMPK. These findings are of great significance for the treatment of SAP-related lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery and evaluation of phenacrylanilide derivatives as novel potential anti-liver fibrosis agents</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phenacrylanilide derivates inhibited TGF-β1- induced hepatic stellate cell proliferation and activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound 42 inhibited fibrotic markers expression with lower toxicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administration of compound 42 improved liver fibrosis and inhibited HSC activation in CCl4-induced mouse fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound 42 regulated unbalanced immune microenvironment &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver fibrosis is characterized by the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components and results from chronic liver injury. At present, there is no approved drug for the treatment of liver fibrosis by the Food and Drug Administration. Here, we have reported a series of novel compounds with phenacrylanilide scaffolds that potently inhibit the transfer growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)-induced activation of LX-2, a hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line. Among them, compound 42 suppressed TGF-β1-induced upregulation of fibrotic markers (α-SMA and fibronectin) and showed excellent safety in vitro. Furthermore, in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) -induced liver fibrosis model, 42 at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day through oral administration for 3 weeks effectively improved liver function, restored damaged liver structures, and reduced collagen deposition, with a greater effect than Tranilast. In addition, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is inhibited by compound 42 in the process of fibrosis. Meanwhile, the imbalanced immune microenvironment could also be effectively reversed. More interestingly, compound 42 prolongs the survival of CCl4 mice and ameliorates CCl4-induced injury to spleen, kidney, lung and heart. Altogether, these results suggest that 42 could be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of liver fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling in perivascular cells enhances inflammation and fibrosis in the kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35976996/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by sustained inflammation and progressive fibrosis, is highly prevalent and can eventually progress to end-stage kidney disease. However, current treatments to slow CKD progression are limited. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a product of sphingolipid catabolism, is a pleiotropic mediator involved in many cellular functions, and drugs targeting S1P signaling have previously been studied particularly for autoimmune diseases. The primary mechanism of most of these drugs is functional antagonism of S1P receptor-1 (S1P1) expressed on lymphocytes and the resultant immunosuppressive effect. Here, we documented the role of local S1P signaling in perivascular cells in the progression of kidney fibrosis using primary kidney perivascular cells and several conditional mouse models. S1P was predominantly produced by sphingosine kinase 2 in kidney perivascular cells and exported via spinster homolog 2 (Spns2). It bound to S1P1 expressed in perivascular cells to enhance production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines upon injury, leading to immune cell infiltration and subsequent fibrosis. A small-molecule Spns2 inhibitor blocked S1P transport, resulting in suppression of inflammatory signaling in human and mouse kidney perivascular cells in vitro and amelioration of kidney fibrosis in mice. Our study provides insight into the regulation of inflammation and fibrosis by S1P and demonstrates the potential of Spns2 inhibition as a treatment for CKD and potentially other inflammatory and fibrotic diseases that avoids the adverse events associated with systemic modulation of S1P receptors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion improves LPS-induced acute lung injury via gut-lung axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35981631/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute inflammatory disorder. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathology of ALI remain elusive. An increasing evidence suggests the role of the gut-microbiota axis in the pathology of lung injury. This study aimed to investigate whether antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion could affect ALI in mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; The effects of antibiotic cocktail (ABX) on ALI in the mice after intratracheally administration of LPS (5 mg/kg) were examined. Furthermore, 16s rRNA analysis and measurement of short-chain fatty acids in feces samples and metabolomics analysis of blood samples were performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; LPS significantly increased the interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of water-treated mice. Interestingly, an ABX significantly attenuated the LPS-induced increase in IL-6 in BALF and lung injury scores. Furthermore, ABX and/or LPS treatment markedly altered the α- and β-diversity of the gut microbiota. There were significant differences in the α- and β-diversity of the water + LPS group and ABX + LPS group. LEfSe analysis identified &lt;em&gt;Enterococusfaecalis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Clostriumtertium&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroidescaecimyris&lt;/em&gt; as potential microbial markers for ABX + LPS group. Untargeted metabolomics analysis identified several plasma metabolites responsible for discriminating water + LPS group from ABX + LPS group. There were correlations between the relative abundance of the microbiome and plasma metabolites. Integrative network analysis showed correlations between IL-6 levels in BALF and several gut microbes (or plasma metabolites).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; These data suggest that ABX-induced microbiome depletion could protect against LPS-induced ALI via the gut-microbiota-lung axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>miR-141 exacerbates lung ischemia-reperfusion injury by targeting EGFR/β-catenin axis-mediated autophagy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) injury. Here, this study aimed to examine whether miR-141 was related to lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) via regulating autophagy and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and to explore the underlying signal transduction pathways. To this end, we constructed the LIRI cell model and mouse models, separately. According to RT-qPCR and Western blotting (WB) analysis results, miR-141 up-regulation together with β-catenin and EGFR down-regulation within mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) or lung tissues was related to lung IRI. Besides, we conducted dual-luciferase reporter assay, which suggested the binding of EGFR to miR-141. In addition, we carried out TUNEL staining, HE staining, and flow cytometric analysis to assess the apoptosis of PMVECs and the injury to mouse lung tissues. Furthermore, we performed light-chain immunofluorescence assay to examine autophagosomes within PMVECs. According to our results, miR-141 suppressed β-catenin level through reducing EGFR level. Besides, the miR-141/EGFR/β-catenin axis enhanced autophagy to aggravate LIRI. To sum up, miR-141 suppresses EGFR expression to inhibit β-catenin level, which subsequently aggravates autophagy and complicates LIRI. The above results offer the candidate therapeutic target for the treatment of lung IRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protection against influenza-induced Acute Lung Injury (ALI) by enhanced induction of M2a macrophages: possible role of PPARγ/RXR ligands in IL-4-induced M2a macrophage differentiation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many respiratory viruses cause lung damage that may evolve into acute lung injury (ALI), a cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and ultimately, death. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) family of transcription factors, regulates transcription by forming heterodimers with another NHR family member, Retinoid X Receptor (RXR). Each component of the heterodimer binds specific ligands that modify transcriptional capacity of the entire heterodimer by recruiting different co-activators/co-repressors. However, the role of PPARγ/RXR ligands in the context of influenza infection is not well understood. PPARγ is associated with macrophage differentiation to an anti-inflammatory M2 state. We show that mice lacking the IL-4Rα receptor, required for M2a macrophage differentiation, are more susceptible to mouse-adapted influenza (A/PR/8/34; &amp;ldquo;PR8&amp;rdquo;)-induced lethality. Mice lacking &lt;em&gt;Ptgs2&lt;/em&gt;, that encodes COX-2, a key proinflammatory M1 macrophage mediator, are more resistant. Blocking the receptor for COX-2-induced Prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was also protective. Treatment with pioglitazone (PGZ), a PPARγ ligand, increased survival from PR8 infection, decreased M1 macrophage gene expression, and increased PPARγ mRNA in lungs. Conversely, conditional knockout mice expressing PPARγ-deficient macrophages were significantly more sensitive to PR8-induced lethality. These findings were extended in cotton rats: PGZ blunted lung inflammation and M1 cytokine gene expression after challenge with non-adapted human influenza. To study mechanisms by which PPARγ/RXR transcription factors induce canonical M2a genes, WT mouse macrophages were treated with IL-4 in the absence or presence of rosiglitazone (RGZ; PPARγ ligand), LG100754 (LG; RXR ligand), or both. IL-4 dose-dependently induced M2a genes &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chil3&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Retnla&lt;/em&gt;. Treatment of macrophages with IL-4 and RGZ and/or LG differentially affected induction of &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;Chil3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Retnla&lt;/em&gt; gene expression. In PPARγ-deficient macrophages, IL-4 alone failed to induce &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; gene expression; however, concurrent treatment with LG or RGZ + LG enhanced IL-4-induced &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; expression, but to a lower level than in WT macrophages, findings confirmed in the murine alveolar macrophage cell line, MH-S. These findings support a model in which PPARγ/RXR heterodimers control IL-4-induced M2a differentiation, and suggest that PPARγ/RXR agonists should be considered as important tools for clinical intervention against influenza-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Qinbaohong Zhike Oral Liquid Attenuates LPS-Induced Acute Lung Injury in Immature Rats by Inhibiting OLFM4</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36035204/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a common public safety threat with high morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients worldwide. Qinbaohong Zhike oral liquid (QBH), a marketed traditional Chinese medicine product, has been widely used to cure respiratory diseases. QBH is reported to have antitussive, expectorant, and antiasthmatic properties. However, its treatment effect against ARIs is not elucidated. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic efficacy of QBH in the treatment of ARIs-induced pneumonia. Network pharmacology was used to predict the possible targets of QBH against ARIs. Next, the tracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS-)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) immature rat model was constructed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of QBH. Tandem mass tag (TMT-)-based quantitative proteomics was then used to screen the in-depth disease targets of QBH. QBH exerted a protective effect against LPS-induced ALI by inhibiting pulmonary pathological damage. QBH also reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the serum and IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF in the lung tissue. Based on proteomic data, olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) related to immunity and inflammation was selected as a potential target. Western blot analysis further confirmed the moderating effect of QBH downregulation on OLFM4 in the lung tissue. Our findings demonstrated that QBH alleviated lung tissue damage and inflammatory reaction via inhibiting OLFM4 expression in LPS-challenged immature rats. Our research indicates that QBH may have therapeutic potential for treating ARIs-related ALI in pediatric patients, which also serves as a candidate target for drug therapy of ALI by intervening OLFM-related signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigenetics, DNA damage, and aging</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a human lifespan, genome integrity erodes, leading to an increased abundance of several types of chromatin changes. The abundance of DNA lesions (chemical perturbations to nucleotides) increases with age, as does the number of genomic mutations and transcriptional disruptions caused by replication or transcription of those lesions, respectively. At the epigenetic level, precise DNA methylation patterns degrade, likely causing increasingly stochastic variations in gene expression. Similarly, the tight regulation of histone modifications begins to unravel. The genomic instability caused by these mechanisms allows transposon element reactivation and remobilization, further mutations, gene dysregulation, and cytoplasmic chromatin fragments. This cumulative genomic instability promotes cell signaling events that drive cell fate decisions and extracellular communications known to disrupt tissue homeostasis and regeneration. In this Review, we focus on age-related epigenetic changes and their interactions with age-related genomic changes that instigate these events.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanisms of pulmonary endothelial permeability and inflammation caused by extracellular histone subunits H3 and H4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular DNA-binding proteins such as histones are danger-associated molecular pattern released by the injured tissues in trauma and sepsis settings, which trigger host immune response and vascular dysfunction. Molecular events leading to histone-induced endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction remain poorly understood. This study performed comparative analysis of H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histone subunits effects on human pulmonary EC permeability and inflammatory response. Analysis of transendothelial electrical resistance and EC monolayer permeability for macromolecues revealed that H3 and H4, but not H1, H2A, or H2B caused dose-dependent EC permeability accompanied by disassembly of adherens junctions. At higher doses, H3 and H4 activated nuclear factor kappa B inflammatory cascade leading to upregulation EC adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1, E-selectin, and release of inflammatory cytokines. Inhibitory receptor analysis showed that toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 but not TLR1/2 or receptor for advanced glycation end inhibition significantly attenuated deleterious effects of H3 and H4 histones. Inhibitor of Rho-kinase was without effect, while inhibition of Src kinase caused partial preservation of cell-cell junctions, H3/H4-induced permeability and inflammation. Deleterious effects of H3/H4 were blocked by heparin. Activation of Epac-Rap1 signaling restored EC barrier properties after histone challenge. Intravenous injection of histones in mice caused elevation of inflammatory markers and increased vascular leak. Post-treatment with pharmacological Epac/Rap1 activator suppressed injurious effects of histones in vitro and in vivo. These results identify H3 and H4 as key histone subunits exhibiting deleterious effects on pulmonary vascular endothelium via TLR4-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, elevation of circulating histones may represent a serious risk of exacerbated acute lung injury (ALI) and multiple organ injury during severe trauma and infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CuO-NPs-triggered heterophil extracellular traps exacerbate liver injury in chicks by promoting oxidative stress and inflammatory responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35962800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the widespread use of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NPs), their potential toxicity to the environment and biological health has attracted close attention. Heterophil extracellular traps (HETs) are an innate immune mechanism of chicken heterophils against adverse stimuli, but excessive HETs cause damage. Here, we explored the effect and mechanism of CuO-NPs on HETs formation in vitro and further evaluated the potential role of HETs in chicken liver and kidney injury. Heterophils were exposed to 5, 10, and 20 µg/mL of CuO-NPs for 2 h. The results showed that CuO-NPs induced typical HETs formation, which was dependent on NADPH oxidase, P38 and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) pathways, and glycolysis. In in vivo experiments, fluorescence microplate and morphological analysis showed that CuO-NPs elevated the level of HETs in chicken serum and caused liver and kidney damage. Meanwhile, CuO-NPs caused hepatic oxidative stress (MDA, SOD, CAT, and GSH-PX imbalance), and also induced an increase in mRNA expression of their inflammatory and apoptosis-related factors (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, COX-2, iNOS, NLRP3, and Caspase-1, 3, 11). However, these results were significantly altered by DNase I (HETs degradation reagent). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that CuO-NPs induce the formation of HETs and that HETs exacerbate pathological damage in chicken liver and kidney by promoting oxidative stress and inflammation, providing insights into immunotoxicity and potential prevention and treatment targets caused by CuO-NPs overexposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macrophage SAMSN1 protects against sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35981417/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the progression of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). SAM domain, SH3 domain and nuclear localization signals 1 (SAMSN1) is a signaling adaptor protein, and mainly regulates inflammatory response of various immune cells. The present study generates macrophage-specific SAMSN1-knockout (Samsn1MKO) and SAMSN1-transgenic (Samsn1MTG) mice to investigate its role and mechanism in sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Samsn1&lt;sup&gt;MKO&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Samsn1&lt;sup&gt;MTG&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instillation or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery to induce sepsis-induced ALI. Bone marrow transplantation, cellular depletion and non-invasive adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were performed to validate the role of macrophage SAMSN1 in sepsis-induced ALI in vivo. Meanwhile, BMDMs were isolated from Samsn1MKO or Samsn1MTG mice to further clarify the role of SAMSN1 in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Macrophage SAMSN1 expression was increased in response to LPS stimulation, and negatively correlated with LPS-induced ALI in mice. Macrophage SAMSN1 deficiency exacerbated, while macrophage SAMSN1 overexpression ameliorated LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and ALI in mice and in BMDMs. Mechanistically, we found that macrophage SAMSN1 overexpression prevented LPS-induced ALI though activating AMP-activated protein kinase α2 (AMPKα2) &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Further studies revealed that SAMSN1 directly bound to growth factor receptor bound protein 2-associated protein 1 (GAB1) to prevent its protein degradation, and subsequently enhanced protein kinase A (PKA)/AMPKα2 activation in a protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11, also known as SHP2)-dependent manner. Moreover, we observed that macrophage SAMSN1 overexpression diminished CLP-induced ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study documents the protective role of macrophage SAMSN1 against sepsis-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and ALI through activating AMPKα2 in a GAB1/SHP2/PKA pathway, and defines it as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target to treat sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Role of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Early Microthrombosis and Brain Injury After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35962915/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microthrombosis plays an important role in secondary brain injury after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but the specific mechanism of microthrombosis remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in microthrombosis after SAH. SAH was induced in male C57BL/6 mice using an endovascular perforation technique. The marker protein of NETs, citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), was significantly elevated in the cerebral cortex after SAH, and was co-labeled with microthrombi. Both depletion of neutrophils by anti-Ly6G antibody and DNase I treatment significantly reduced the formation of NETs and microthrombi, and ameliorated neurological deficits, brain edema, BBB disruption, and neuronal injury at 24 h after SAH induction. Cerebral hypoperfusion in the first hours after SAH is a major determinant of poor neurological outcome; in this study, we found that DNase I treatment significantly improved the restoration of early cortical perfusion after SAH. In addition, DNase I treatment also significantly attenuated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow after SAH, which was associated with the diffusion barrier caused by microthrombi in the paravascular space after SAH. In conclusion, NETs are associated with early microthrombosis after SAH; they may be a novel therapeutic target for early brain injury (EBI) after SAH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upregulating carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 attenuates hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and persistent lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35964084/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease in premature infants that may cause long-term lung dysfunction. Accumulating evidence supports the vascular hypothesis of BPD, in which lung endothelial cell dysfunction drives this disease. We recently reported that endothelial carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a) is reduced by hyperoxia, and that endothelial cell-specific Cpt1a knockout mice are more susceptible to developing hyperoxia-induced injury than wild type mice. Whether Cpt1a upregulation attenuates hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and lung injury remains unknown. We hypothesized that upregulation of Cpt1a by baicalin or L-carnitine ameliorates hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and persistent lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Lung endothelial cells or newborn mice (&amp;lt; 12 h old) were treated with baicalin or L-carnitine after hyperoxia (50% and 95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) followed by air recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that incubation with L-carnitine (40 and 80 mg/L) and baicalin (22.5 and 45 mg/L) reduced hyperoxia-induced apoptosis, impaired cell migration and angiogenesis in cultured lung endothelial cells. This was associated with increased Cpt1a gene expression. In mice, neonatal hyperoxia caused persistent alveolar and vascular simplification in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with L-carnitine (150 and 300 mg/kg) and baicalin (50 and 100 mg/kg) attenuated neonatal hyperoxia-induced alveolar and vascular simplification in adult mice. These effects were diminished in endothelial cell-specific Cpt1a knockout mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Upregulating Cpt1a by baicalin or L-carnitine ameliorates hyperoxia-induced lung endothelial cell dysfunction, and persistent alveolar and vascular simplification. These findings provide potential therapeutic avenues for using L-carnitine and baicalin as Cpt1a upregulators to prevent persistent lung injury in premature infants with BPD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zanubrutinib could relieve LPS induced lung injuries in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway is involved in Zanubrutinib -mediated M1 macrophage polarization in RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zanubrutinib promotes M2 macrophage activation through regulating JAK/STAT6 and PI3K/AKT pathway in RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a disease characterized by pulmonary diffusion dysfunction and its exacerbation stage is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may develop to multiple organ failure and seriously threatens human health. ALI has high mortality rates and few effective treatments, thus effective protection measures for ALI are becoming increasingly important. Macrophages play a key regulatory role in the pathogenesis of ALI, and the degree of macrophage polarization is closely related to the severity and prognosis of ALI. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Zanubrutinib (ZB), a BTK small molecule inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of cell lymphoma, on macrophage polarization and acute lung injury. In the in vivo study, we constructed a mouse model of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury and found that ZB could improve the acute injury of mouse lungs by inhibiting the secretion of proinflammatory factors and promoting the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, reduce the number of inflammatory cells in alveolar lavage fluid, and then alleviate the inflammatory response. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that ZB could inhibit the M1 macrophage polarization and promote the M2 macrophage polarization. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that ZB could inhibit the macrophage M1 polarization via targeting BTK activation and inhibiting JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways, and promote the macrophage M2 polarization by promoting the activation of STAT6 and PI3K / Akt signaling pathways. In summary, ZB has shown therapeutic effect in LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, which provides a potential candidate drug to treat acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ischemia-Selective Cardioprotection by Malonate for Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35959683/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inhibiting SDH (succinate dehydrogenase), with the competitive inhibitor malonate, has shown promise in ameliorating ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, key for translation to the clinic is understanding the mechanism of malonate entry into cells to enable inhibition of SDH, its mitochondrial target, as malonate itself poorly permeates cellular membranes. The possibility of malonate selectively entering the at-risk heart tissue on reperfusion, however, remains unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6J mice, C2C12 and H9c2 myoblasts, and HeLa cells were used to elucidate the mechanism of selective malonate uptake into the ischemic heart upon reperfusion. Cells were treated with malonate while varying pH or together with transport inhibitors. Mouse hearts were either perfused ex vivo (Langendorff) or subjected to in vivo left anterior descending coronary artery ligation as models of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Succinate and malonate levels were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS, in vivo by mass spectrometry imaging, and infarct size by TTC (2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride) staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Malonate was robustly protective against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury, but only if administered at reperfusion and not when infused before ischemia. The extent of malonate uptake into the heart was proportional to the duration of ischemia. Malonate entry into cardiomyocytes in vivo and in vitro was dramatically increased at the low pH (≈6.5) associated with ischemia. This increased uptake of malonate was blocked by selective inhibition of MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter 1). Reperfusion of the ischemic heart region with malonate led to selective SDH inhibition in the at-risk region. Acid-formulation greatly enhances the cardioprotective potency of malonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Cardioprotection by malonate is dependent on its entry into cardiomyocytes. This is facilitated by the local decrease in pH that occurs during ischemia, leading to its selective uptake upon reperfusion into the at-risk tissue, via MCT1. Thus, malonate&amp;rsquo;s preferential uptake in reperfused tissue means it is an at-risk tissue-selective drug that protects against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chlorogenic Acid Prevents Hyperuricemia Nephropathy via Regulating TMAO-Related Gut Microbes and Inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35950815/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperuricemia is an independent hazard factor of renal injury and can induce renal fibrosis, promoting the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to explore the probability of chlorogenic acid (CGA) as a potential substance for preventing hyperuricemia nephropathy (HN). Pretreatment with CGA downregulated SUA, BUN, and CR levels, relieved oxidative stress and inflammatory response, alleviated kidney fibrosis, and contributed to the prevention of HN. In the gut microbiota, &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Faecalibaculum&lt;/em&gt; related to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) synthesis were significantly increased in HN rats. In addition, it showed a significant increase in serum TMAO content in HN rats. However, CGA regulated the cascade response of the microbiota-TMAO signaling to reverse the increase of serum TMAO. CGA also decreased the protein expression of protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by reducing the production of TMAO. CGA delayed kidney fibrosis in HN rats as evidenced by regulating the cascade response of the microbiota-TMAO-PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In summary, CGA can be an excellent candidate for HN prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of the key ferroptosis-related genes involved in sepsis progression and experimental validation in vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36188533/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36188533/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ferroptosis has a vital role in sepsis, but the mechanism is not known. Understanding the mechanism of ferroptosis during sepsis will aid in developing improved therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used the Gene Expression Omnibus database and FerrDb database to obtain ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between sepsis patients and healthy volunteers (HVs). Analyses of PPI networks, functional enrichment, as well as use of the MCODE algorithm were used to identify key ferroptosis-related DEGs. Expression of key ferroptosis-related DEGs was verified using: GSE57065 and GSE65682 datasets; rats in which ferroptosis was induced with erastin; sepsis-induced acute lung injury (siALI) rats. The effects of acupoint catgut embedding (ACE) on ferroptosis and expression of key ferroptosis-related DEGs in the lungs of siALI rats were also observed. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to verify the effect of key ferroptosis-related DEGs on the survival of sepsis patients. Cytoscape was used to construct ceRNA networks and gene-transcription factor networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Between sepsis patients and HVs, we identified 33 ferroptosis-related DEGs. According to analyses of PPI networks and the MCODE algorithm, we obtained four modules, of which the most significant module contained nine ferroptosis-related DEGs. Functional-enrichment analyses showed that four of the nine DEGs were enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway: &lt;em&gt;MAPK14&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;VEGFA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TGFBR1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DUSP1&lt;/em&gt;. We verified expression of these four genes in GSE57065 and GSE65682 datasets and ferroptosis rats. In addition, expression of these four genes and that of the oxidative-stress indicators GSSG and MDA was upregulated, and glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4) expression was downregulated, in siALI rats, but ACE reversed these changes. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that survival of sepsis patients in the high-risk group was shorter than that in the low-risk group. We found that the XIST-hsa-let-7b-5p-TGFBR1/DUSP1 ceRNA network and transcription factor E2F1 may be important regulators of these four DEGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results suggest that &lt;em&gt;MAPK14&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;VEGFA,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;TGFBR1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DUSP1&lt;/em&gt; may be key regulatory targets of ferroptosis in sepsis, and that ACE pretreatment may be antioxidant treatment for sepsis and alleviate ferroptosis. These findings provide a basis for further ferroptosis-related study in sepsis and provide new targets for its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial quality control in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury: new insights into mechanisms and implications</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35951200/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current effective method for the treatment of myocardial infarction is timely restoration of the blood supply to the ischemic area of the heart. Although reperfusion is essential for reestablishing oxygen and nutrient supplies, it often leads to additional myocardial damage, creating an important clinical dilemma. Reports from long-term studies have confirmed that mitochondrial damage is the critical mechanism in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Mitochondria are dynamic and possess a quality control system that targets mitochondrial quantity and quality by modifying mitochondrial fusion, fission, mitophagy, and biogenesis and protein homeostasis to maintain a healthy mitochondrial network. The system of mitochondrial quality control involves complex molecular machinery that is highly interconnected and associated with pathological changes such as oxidative stress, calcium overload, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Because of the critical role of the mitochondrial quality control systems, many reports have suggested that defects in this system are among the molecular mechanisms underlying myocardial reperfusion injury. In this review, we briefly summarize the important role of the mitochondrial quality control in cardiomyocyte function and focus on the current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and molecular pathways involved in mitochondrial quality control in cardiac I/R damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Morphological, cellular, and molecular basis of brain infection in COVID-19 patients</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35951647/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although increasing evidence confirms neuropsychiatric manifestations associated mainly with severe COVID-19 infection, long-term neuropsychiatric dysfunction (recently characterized as part of &amp;ldquo;long COVID-19&amp;rdquo; syndrome) has been frequently observed after mild infection. We show the spectrum of cerebral impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, ranging from long-term alterations in mildly infected individuals (orbitofrontal cortical atrophy, neurocognitive impairment, excessive fatigue and anxiety symptoms) to severe acute damage confirmed in brain tissue samples extracted from the orbitofrontal region (via endonasal transethmoidal access) from individuals who died of COVID-19. In an independent cohort of 26 individuals who died of COVID-19, we used histopathological signs of brain damage as a guide for possible SARS-CoV-2 brain infection and found that among the 5 individuals who exhibited those signs, all of them had genetic material of the virus in the brain. Brain tissue samples from these five patients also exhibited foci of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, particularly in astrocytes. Supporting the hypothesis of astrocyte infection, neural stem cell-derived human astrocytes in vitro are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection through a noncanonical mechanism that involves spike-NRP1 interaction. SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes manifested changes in energy metabolism and in key proteins and metabolites used to fuel neurons, as well as in the biogenesis of neurotransmitters. Moreover, human astrocyte infection elicits a secretory phenotype that reduces neuronal viability. Our data support the model in which SARS-CoV-2 reaches the brain, infects astrocytes, and consequently, leads to neuronal death or dysfunction. These deregulated processes could contribute to the structural and functional alterations seen in the brains of COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Repair effect of photobiomodulation combined with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells on rats with acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36029758/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) impaired the function of blood oxygen exchange function, resulting in tissue hypoxia and patient death. Recently, human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) are thought to mitigate the effects of ALI, which boosts researchers&amp;rsquo; interest in employing stem cell-based therapies to manage ALI. However, as a novel therapy, hUCMSCs still face various limitations such as migrating weakly and insufficient proliferation in vivo. Photobiomodulation (PBM) effciently promotes cell proliferation, migration and homing, which presents a promising strategy for overcoming above limitations. In this study, PBM was emerged to intervene hUCMSCs through detecting cell proliferation, oxidative stress-related factors and inflammatory factors. These results assuredly confirmed that PBM enhanced the antioxidant capacity of cells and improved cell survival in vitro experiments. In vivo, PBM-intervened hUCMSCs intuitively reduce thickness of alveolar septum, excessive secretion of inflammatory factors, relieves bleeding, edema and fibrosis. As a physical intervention, PBM further strengthens the therapeutic effect of hUCMSCs and depicted a hopeful therapy in ALI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antioxidant Biodegradable Covalent Cyclodextrin Frameworks as Particulate Carriers for Inhalation Therapy against Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35948492/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug therapies for acute lung injury (ALI) are far from satisfactory, primarily because drugs cannot specifically target the lungs. Direct delivery of drugs to the deep alveolar regions by inhalation administration is crucial for the treatment of ALI. However, conventional inhalable carriers such as lactose and mannitol are generally inactive. Therefore, the use of a novel pharmacologically active carrier for pulmonary delivery may produce synergetic effects in treating ALI. Considering the pathophysiological environment of ALI, which typically featured excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acute inflammation, we synthesized a novel kind of biodegradable and ROS-sensitive cross-linked covalent cyclodextrin frameworks (OC-COF) with uniform inhalable particle size to treat ALI. OC-COF was devised to incorporate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-scavenging peroxalate ester linkages, which could hydrolyze and eliminate ROS generated in inflammatory sites. Ligustrazine (LIG), an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory natural compound, was loaded into OC-COF and evaluated as a dry powder inhaler (LIG@OC-COF) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, showing favorable aerodynamic properties and prominent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities for the synergistic effects of OC-COF and LIG. In ALI rats, inhalation of LIG@OC-COF with a one-fifth LIG dose significantly alleviated the inflammation, oxidant stress, and lung damage. Western blot analysis demonstrated that LIG@OC-COF protected the lungs by regulating the Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway. In summary, this study provides a novel ROS-responsive material as an inhalable particulate carrier for the improved treatment of ALI and other medical conditions.reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autoinducer-2 promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36033859/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that causes various acute and chronic lung infections in immunocompromised patients. We previously found that a quorum sensing (QS) signal, namely, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), facilitates the pathogenicity of the wild-type (WT) &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 strain &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. However, the immunological mechanism that leads to pulmonary injury remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of AI-2 on interleukin-17A (IL-17A) production during acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 lung infection using a mouse model, with an emphasis on the underlying immunological mechanism. Compared to infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 alone, infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 combined with AI-2 treatment resulted in significantly increased levels of IL-17A, numbers of Th17 cells and levels of STAT3 in the lung tissues of WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), as well as more serious lung damage. In contrast, the concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and the chemokine keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) were significantly reduced during &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infection in IL-17A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and no effects were observed after AI-2 treatment (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the level of IL-17A in the lungs of WT mice was significantly reduced following infection with a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; strain harboring mutations in the QS genes &lt;em&gt;lasR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rhlR&lt;/em&gt; compared with the level of IL-17A following infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1. Our data suggest that AI-2 promotes &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway by interfering with the QS systems of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. IL-17A may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infections in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal stromal cells-derived extracellular vesicles reprogramme macrophages in ARDS models through the miR-181a-5p-PTEN-pSTAT5-SOCS1 axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; A better understanding of the mechanism of action of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) is needed to support their use as novel therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Macrophages are important mediators of ARDS inflammatory response. Suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins are key regulators of the macrophage phenotype switch. We therefore investigated whether SOCS proteins are involved in mediation of the MSC effect on human macrophage reprogramming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or plasma samples from patients with ARDS (these samples were previously classified into hypo-inflammatory and hyper-inflammatory phenotype) and treated with MSC conditioned medium (CM) or EVs. Protein expression was measured by Western blot. EV micro RNA (miRNA) content was determined by miRNA sequencing. In vivo: LPS-injured C57BL/6 mice were given EVs isolated from MSCs in which miR-181a had been silenced by miRNA inhibitor or overexpressed using miRNA mimic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; EVs were the key component of MSC CM responsible for anti-inflammatory modulation of human macrophages. EVs significantly reduced secretion of tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-8 by LPS-stimulated or ARDS plasma-stimulated MDMs and this was dependent on SOCS1. Transfer of miR-181a in EVs downregulated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and subsequently activated phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5) leading to upregulation of SOCS1 in macrophages. In vivo, EVs alleviated lung injury and upregulated pSTAT5 and SOCS1 expression in alveolar macrophages in a miR181-dependent manner. Overexpression of miR-181a in MSCs significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy of EVs in this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; miR-181a-PTEN-pSTAT5-SOCS1 axis is a novel pathway responsible for immunomodulatory effect of MSC EVs in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oridonin attenuates lung inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis via covalent targeting iNOS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36076611/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oridonin alleviates the progression of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oridonin inhibits silica-induced alveolar macrophage injury and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oridonin covalently targets iNOS and inhibits its level and activity, thereby providing a new potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of silicosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicosis, the most common type of pneumoconiosis, exhibits a high incidence in workers who are chronically exposed to crystalline silica (CS). No specific remedy for cure as yet. The terpenoid oridonin exerts multiple modulatory functions in neoplasms and inflammations as a natural compound. In this study, we explored the effect of oridonin on silicosis and revealed the underlying molecular mechanism. An experimental silicosis mouse model was established to evaluate the effects of oridonin on pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, the impact of oridonin on alveolar macrophages (AMs) was examined in the MH-S cell line. Its molecular target, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), was identified by chemobiological means, and virus-mediated gene overexpression systems confirmed that oridonin directly restrained iNOS protein levels. Oridonin alleviated pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis in silicosis mice with no obvious systemic toxicity. These effects were partially related to oridonin inhibition of CS-induced AMs injury and inflammation. Furthermore, oridonin suppressed iNOS enzymatic expression and activity by covalently binding to the Thr109 residue of the iNOS target. Thus, our results indicate oridonin as a potential iNOS enzymatic suppressor in experimental silicosis that attenuates pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis progression, which provides a therapeutic avenue for silicosis prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salvianolactone acid A isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice by regulating PPAR-γ</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35985183/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Severe inflammation of the lungs results from acute lung injury (ALI), a common life-threatening lung disease with a high mortality rate. The ligand-activated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ plays essential roles in diverse biological processes including inflammation, metabolism, development, and immune response. Salvianolactone acid A (SA) is a terpenoid derived from the herb Salvia miltiorrhiza. However, there is a scarcity of experimental evidence indicating whether the effect of SA on ALI occurs via PPAR-γ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; SA (20 or 40 mg/kg, i.g., 1 time/day) was administered to mice for 3 d, followed by the induction of ALI by intranasal lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg). The lung function and levels of inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), immune cells, apoptosis, and PPAR-γ were examined. The antagonistic activity of GW9662 (GW, 1 µM, specific PPAR-γ blocker) and PPAR-γ transfection silencing against SA (10 μM) in BEAS-2B cells induced by LPS (10 μg/ml, 24 h) was also investigated to assess whether the observed effects caused by SA were mediated by PPAR-γ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that lung histopathological injury, the B-line, the fluorescence intensity of live small animal, and the biomarkers in BALF or lung in the treatment of SA could regulate significantly. In addition, SA obviously decreased the levels of ROS and apoptosis in the primary lung cells, and MDA, increased the levels of GSH-Px and SOD. SA reduced levels of macrophages and neutrophils. Furthermore, SA reduced the protein levels of Keap-1, Cleaved-caspase-3, Cleaved-caspase-9, p-p65/p65, NLRP3, IL-1β, and upregulated the levels of p-Nrf2/Nrf2, HO-1, Bcl-2/Bax, PPAR-γ, p-AMPK/AMPK in lung tissue. In addition, silencing and inhibition of PPAR-γ effectively decreased the protective effects of SA in BEAS-2B cells induced by LPS, which might indicate that the active molecules of SA regulate ALI via mediation by PPAR-γ, which exhibited that the effect of SA related to PPAR-γ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The anti-ALI effects of SA were partially mediated through PPAR-γ signaling. These data provide the molecular justification for the usage of SA in treating ALI and can assist in increasing the comprehensive utilization rate of Salvia miltiorrhiza.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death worldwide1. Although advances have been made in acute treatment, an incomplete understanding of remodelling processes has limited the effectiveness of therapies to reduce late-stage mortality2. Here we generate an integrative high-resolution map of human cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction using single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility and spatial transcriptomic profiling of multiple physiological zones at distinct time points in myocardium from patients with myocardial infarction and controls. Multi-modal data integration enabled us to evaluate cardiac cell-type compositions at increased resolution, yielding insights into changes of the cardiac transcriptome and epigenome through the identification of distinct tissue structures of injury, repair and remodelling. We identified and validated disease-specific cardiac cell states of major cell types and analysed them in their spatial context, evaluating their dependency on other cell types. Our data elucidate the molecular principles of human myocardial tissue organization, recapitulating a gradual cardiomyocyte and myeloid continuum following ischaemic injury. In sum, our study provides an integrative molecular map of human myocardial infarction, represents an essential reference for the field and paves the way for advanced mechanistic and therapeutic studies of cardiac disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advances in the use of exosomes for the treatment of ALI/ARDS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36016948/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality. Currently, the primary treatment for ALI/ARDS is mainly symptomatic therapy such as mechanical ventilation and fluid management. Due to the lack of effective treatment strategies, most ALI/ARDS patients face a poor prognosis. The discovery of exosomes has created a promising prospect for the treatment of ALI/ARDS. Exosomes can exert anti-inflammatory effects, inhibit apoptosis, and promote cell regeneration. The microRNA contained in exosomes can participate in intercellular communication and play an immunomodulatory role in ALI/ARDS disease models. This review discusses the possible mechanisms of exosomes in ALI/ARDS to facilitate the development of innovative treatments for ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Erythropoietin mediates re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages through PI3K/AKT signaling and protects mice against secondary infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016936/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure leads to a hypo-responsive state by macrophages to a secondary stimulation of LPS, known as endotoxin tolerance. However, recent findings show that functions of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages are not completely suppressed, whereas they undergo a functional re-programming process with upregulation of a panel of molecules leading to enhanced protective functions including antimicrobial and tissue-remodeling activities. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), exerts anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective activities. Nevertheless, the potential effects of EPO on functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages have not been investigated yet. Here, we found that initial LPS exposure led to upregulation of HIF-1α/EPO in macrophages and that EPO enhanced tolerance in tolerized macrophages and mice as demonstrated by suppressed proinflammatory genes such as &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; after secondary LPS stimulation. Moreover, we showed that EPO improved host protective genes in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages and mice, such as the anti-bacterial genes coding for cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (&lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;) and macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (&lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;), and the tissue-repairing gene vascular endothelial growth factor C (&lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;). Therefore, our findings indicate that EPO mediates the functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages. Mechanistically, we found that PI3K/AKT signaling contributed to EPO-mediated re-programming through upregulation of &lt;em&gt;Irak3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wdr5&lt;/em&gt; expression. Specifically, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK3) was responsible for inhibiting proinflammatory genes &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; in tolerized macrophages after LPS rechallenge, whereas WDR5 contributed to the upregulation of host beneficial genes including &lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;. In a septic model of mice, EPO pretreatment significantly promoted endotoxin-tolerant re-programming, alleviated lung injury, enhanced bacterial clearance, and decreased mortality in LPS-tolerized mice after secondary infection of &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;. Collectively, our results reveal a novel role for EPO in mediating functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages; thus, targeting EPO appears to be a new therapeutic option in sepsis and other inflammatory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for acute respiratory failure: a review of potential indications, clinical practice and open research questions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) is a form of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) largely aimed at removing carbon dioxide in patients with acute hypoxemic or acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, so as to minimize respiratory acidosis, allowing more lung protective ventilatory settings which should decrease ventilator-induced lung injury. ECCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R is increasingly being used despite the lack of high-quality evidence, while complications associated with the technique remain an issue of concern. This review explains the physiological basis underlying the use of ECCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R, reviews the evidence regarding indications and contraindications, patient management and complications, and addresses organizational and ethical considerations. The indications and the risk-to-benefit ratio of this technique should now be carefully evaluated using structured national or international registries and large randomized trials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histopathological, physiological and biochemical assessment of resveratrol nanocapsules efficacy in bleomycin-induced acute and chronic lung injury in rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35945895/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening illness which may progress to chronic pulmonary fibrosis (CPF). Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenol, is known to exert several pharmacological effects on lung injury. However, its physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic profile limit its clinical applications. In this study, RSV was loaded into lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) aiming to overcome these limitations. RSV-LNCs were prepared by phase inversion method and showed small uniform particle size (∼55 nm, PdI 0.04) with high entrapment efficiency &amp;gt;99%. The efficacy of RSV-LNCs in the prophylaxis against ALI and treatment of CPF was investigated in bleomycin-induced lung injury. For assessment of ALI, rats were administered a single oral dose of RSV (10 mg/kg) either free or as RSV-LNCs 4 h before bleomycin and euthanized 3 days later. For CPF, treatments in the same dose were given daily from days 10-20 after bleomycin and rats were euthanized on day-21. Results showed enhanced beneficial role for RSV-LNCs, compared to RSV, in the prevention of ALI as demonstrated by preservation of pulmonary microscopic and ultrastructural architecture and improvement of pulmonary functions. Analysis of BALF revealed reduction in oxidative stress markers, IL-6 level, leukocytosis and neutrophilia. iNOS and c-caspase 3 immunohistochemical expression and CD68+ cells immunofluorescence were inhibited. However, RSV-LNCs failed to show any improvement in oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, apoptosis and collagen deposition in CPF. In conclusion, RSV-LNCs are promising nanoplatforms for mitigating ALI detrimental effects. Future research investigating higher doses and longer durations of treatment is recommended to evaluate RSV-LNCs anti-fibrotic potential in CPF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) and &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin in vivo imaging detects pulmonary oxidative stress and cell death, respectively, in rats exposed to &amp;gt;95% O2 (hyperoxia) as a model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Preexposure to hyperoxia for 48 h followed by 24 h in room air (H-T) is protective against hyperoxia-induced lung injury. This study&amp;rsquo;s objective was to determine the ability of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO and &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin to track this protection and to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Rats were exposed to normoxia, hyperoxia for 60 h, H-T, or H-T followed by 60 h of hyperoxia (H-T + 60). Imaging was performed 20 min after intravenous injection of either &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO or &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin. &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO and &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin lung uptake was 200% and 167% greater (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) in hyperoxia compared with normoxia rats, respectively. On the other hand, uptake of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO in H-T + 60 was 24% greater (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) than in H-T rats, but &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin uptake was not significantly different (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.09). Lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, pleural effusion, endothelial filtration coefficient, and histological indices all showed evidence of protection and paralleled imaging results. Additional results indicate higher mitochondrial complex IV activity in H-T versus normoxia rats, suggesting that mitochondria of H-T lungs may be more tolerant of oxidative stress. A pattern of increasing lung uptake of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO and &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin correlates with advancing oxidative stress and cell death and worsening injury, whereas stable or decreasing &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO and stable &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin reflects hyperoxia tolerance, suggesting the potential utility of molecular imaging for identifying at-risk hosts that are more or less susceptible to progressing to ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Natriuretic peptide receptor-C mediates the inhibitory effect of atrial natriuretic peptide on neutrophil recruitment to the lung during acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) protects against acute lung injury (ALI), but the receptor that mediates this effect is not known. Transgenic mice with 0 (knockout), 1 (heterozygote), or 2 (wild-type) functional copies of Npr3, the gene that encodes for natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C), were treated with intravenous infusion of ANP or saline vehicle before oropharyngeal aspiration of &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; (PA103) or saline vehicle. Lung injury was assessed 4 h following aspiration by measurement of lung wet/dry (W/D) weight, whole lung leukocyte and cytokine levels, and protein, leukocyte, and cytokine concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). PA103 induced acute lung injury as evidenced by increases in lung W/D ratio and protein concentration in BALF. The severity of PA103-induced lung injury did not differ between NPR-C genotypes. Treatment with intravenous ANP infusion reduced PA103-induced increases in lung W/D and BALF protein concentration in all three NPRC genotypes. PA103 increased the percentage of leukocytes that were neutrophils and cytokine levels in whole lung and BALF in NPR-C wild-type and knockout mice. This effect was blunted by ANP in wild-type mice but not in the NPR-C knockout mice. NPR-C does not mediate the protective effect of ANP on endothelial cell permeability in settings of PA103-induced injury but may mediate the effect of ANP on inhibition of the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and thereby attenuate the release of inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD-L1 maintains neutrophil extracellular traps release by inhibiting neutrophil autophagy in endotoxin-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016930/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is not only an important molecule in mediating tumor immune escape, but also regulates inflammation development. Here we showed that PD-L1 was upregulated on neutrophils in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Neutrophil specific knockout of PD-L1 reduced lung injury in ARDS model induced by intratracheal LPS injection. The level of NET release was reduced and autophagy is elevated by PD-L1 knockout in ARDS neutrophils both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Inhibition of autophagy could reverse the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 knockout on NET release. PD-L1 interacted with p85 subunit of PI3K at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in neutrophils from ARDS patients, activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. An extrinsic neutralizing antibody against PD-L1 showed a protective effect against ARDS. Together, PD-L1 maintains the release of NETs by regulating autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in ARDS. Anti-PD-L1 therapy may be a promising measure in treating ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Allyl methyl trisulfide protected against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice via inhibition of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36003507/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allyl methyl trisulfide (AMTS) is one major lipid-soluble organosulfur compound of garlic. Previous studies have reported the potential therapeutic effect of garlic on acute lung injury (ALI) or its severe condition acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the specific substances that exert the regulatory effects are still unclear. In this study, we investigate the protective effects of AMTS on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice and explored the underlying mechanisms. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments, ICR mice were pretreated with 25-100 mg/kg AMTS for 7 days and followed by intratracheal instillation of LPS (1.5 mg/kg). The results showed that AMTS significantly attenuated LPS-induced deterioration of lung pathology, demonstrated by ameliorative edema and protein leakage, and improved pulmonary histopathological morphology. Meanwhile, the expression of inflammatory mediators and the infiltration of inflammation-regulation cells induced by LPS were also inhibited. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments also revealed that AMTS could alleviate inflammation response and inhibit the exaggeration of macrophage M1 polarization in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, we identified that AMTS treatment could attenuate the LPS-induced elevation of protein expression of p-IκBα, nuclear NF-κB-p65, COX2, iNOS, p-P38, p-ERK1/2, and p-JNK. Collectively, these data suggest that AMTS could attenuate LPS-induced ALI and the molecular mechanisms should be related to the suppression of the NF-κB and MAPKs pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cangma Huadu granules attenuate H1N1 virus-induced severe lung injury correlated with repressed apoptosis and altered gut microbiome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36090063/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe influenza A virus infection leads to overwhelming inflammatory responses and cellular apoptosis, which causes lung injury and contributes to high mortality and morbidity. The gut microbiome altered in response to the infection might influence the disease progression and the treatment outcome. Cangma Huadu (CMHD) granules, an in-hospital preparation of traditional Chinese medicine, have been shown to be favorable in the clinical treatment of influenza. However, the effects and mechanisms of CMHD granules on severe influenza pneumonia and its mechanisms are not well-known. In this study, a lethal influenza A (H1N1) A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (PR8)-infected mice model was established, and the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) V3-V4 region sequencing of the intestinal microbiome was conducted. We revealed that the oral administration of CMHD granules protects mice against higher mortality, enhanced weight loss, overwhelmed interferon-γ concentration, lung viral titers, and severe lung pathological injury in PR8-infected mice. CMHD granules&amp;rsquo; administration downregulated the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and malondialdehyde, while it upregulated the levels of IL-10, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. Subsequently, it decreased the protein ratio of B-cell lymphoma-2/Bcl-2-associated X and the expression of cleaved caspase-3. The diversity and compositions of the gut microbes were altered profoundly after the administration of CMHD granules in PR8-infected mice. A higher abundance of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parasutterella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Faecalibaculum&lt;/em&gt; was observed in the CMHD group, and a higher abundance of &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/em&gt; was observed in the positive drug Ribavirin group. The linear discriminant analysis effect size also revealed a higher proportion of &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium_pseudolongum&lt;/em&gt; characterized in the CMHD group. These results demonstrated that CMHD granules are a promising strategy for managing severe influenza and attenuating severe lung damage via reducing viral titer, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress. The mechanisms are involved in repressed Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis and altered composition and diversity of the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Galectin-3 inhibitor GB0139 protects against acute lung injury by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment and activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36003515/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Galectin-3 (Gal-3) drives fibrosis during chronic lung injury, however, its role in acute lung injury (ALI) remains unknown. Effective pharmacological therapies available for ALI are limited; identifying novel concepts in treatment is essential. GB0139 is a Gal-3 inhibitor currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We investigate the role of Gal-3 in ALI and evaluate whether its inhibition with GB0139 offers a protective role. The effect of GB0139 on ALI was explored &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The pharmacokinetic profile of intra-tracheal (i.t.) GB0139 was investigated in C57BL/6 mice to support the daily dosing regimen. GB0139 (1-30 µg) was then assessed following acute i.t. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bleomycin administration. Histology, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALf) analysis, and flow cytometric analysis of lung digests and BALf were performed. The impact of GB0139 on cell activation and apoptosis was determined &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; using neutrophils and THP-1, A549 and Jurkat E6 cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; GB0139 decreased inflammation severity via a reduction in neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and neutrophil activation. GB0139 reduced LPS-mediated increases in interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, GB0139 inhibited Gal-3-induced neutrophil activation, monocyte IL-8 secretion, T cell apoptosis and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes encoding for IL-8, TNFα, IL-6 in alveolar epithelial cells in response to mechanical stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These data indicate that Gal-3 adopts a pro-inflammatory role following the early stages of lung injury and supports the development of GB0139, as a potential treatment approach in ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil trogocytosis during their trans-endothelial migration: role of extracellular CIRP</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35941574/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Neutrophils are the most abundant innate immune cells in the circulating blood, and they act as the first responder against bacterial and fungal infection. However, accumulation of activated neutrophils can cause severe inflammation and tissue damage. Recently, neutrophil trogocytosis or membrane transfer with neighboring cells was reported to modulate immune responses. Extracellular cold-inducible RNA binding protein (eCIRP) is a newly identified damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). eCIRP can activate neutrophils to be more pro-inflammatory. This study aimed to identify the role of eCIRP in neutrophil trogocytosis during their trans-endothelial migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A trans-endothelial migration (TEM) assay using bone marrow neutrophils and mouse primary lung vascular endothelial cells was conducted using transwell chambers and neutrophil trogocytosis was assessed in vitro. In an in vivo mouse model of acute lung injury, neutrophil trogocytosis was assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In TEM assay, the trogocytosis of neutrophils occurred during trans-endothelial migration and eCIRP significantly increased the percentage of these neutrophils. The trogocytosed neutrophils acquired the endothelial membrane containing junctional adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C) and VE-cadherin, and these membrane patches were polarized by Mac-1 binding. Furthermore, eCIRP-induced JAM-C positive trogocytosed neutrophils are more pro-inflammatory than the JAM-C negative counterpart. JAM-C positive trogocytosed neutrophils were also observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a mouse model of acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These data suggest that during the paracellular trans-endothelial migration of neutrophils in response to inflammation, eCIRP induces trogocytosis of neutrophils, and the trogocytosed neutrophils exhibit an exaggerated pro-inflammatory phenotype promoting acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a potentially life-threatening, devastating disease with an extremely high rate of mortality. The underlying mechanism of ALI is currently unclear. In this study, we aimed to confirm the hub genes associated with ALI and explore their functions and molecular mechanisms using bioinformatics methods. Five microarray datasets available in GEO were used to perform Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the key genes were identified via the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Lipopolysaccharide intraperitoneal injection was administered to establish an ALI model. Overall, 40 robust DEGs, which are mainly involved in the inflammatory response, protein catabolic process, and NF-κB signaling pathway were identified. Among these DEGs, we identified two genes associated with ALI, of which the CAV-1/NF-κB axis was significantly upregulated in ALI, and was identified as one of the most effective targets for ALI prevention. Subsequently, the expression of CAV-1 was knocked down using AAV-shCAV-1 or CAV-1-siRNA to study its effect on the pathogenesis of ALI in vivo and in vitro. The results of this study indicated that CAV-1/NF-κB axis levels were elevated in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by an increase in lung inflammation and autophagy. The knockdown of CAV-1 may improve ALI. Mechanistically, inflammation was reduced mainly by decreasing the expression levels of CD3 and F4/80, and activating autophagy by inhibiting AKT/mTOR and promoting the AMPK signaling pathway. Taken together, this study provides crucial evidence that CAV-1 knockdown inhibits the occurrence of ALI, suggesting that the CAV-1/NF-κB axis may be a promising therapeutic target for ALI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dysregulation of the kallikrein-kinin system in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with severe COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35939907/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35939907/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a critical component of the kallikrein-kinin system. Its dysregulation may lead to increased vascular permeability and release of inflammatory chemokines. Interactions between the kallikrein-kinin and the coagulation system might further contribute to thromboembolic complications in COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this observational study, we measured plasma and tissue kallikrein hydrolytic activity, levels of kinin peptides, and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA complexes as a biomarker for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with and without COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Findings:&lt;/em&gt; In BAL fluid from patients with severe COVID-19 (n = 21, of which 19 were mechanically ventilated), we observed higher tissue kallikrein activity (18·2 pM [1·2-1535·0], median [range], n = 9 vs 3·8 [0·0-22·0], n = 11; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0·030), higher levels of the kinin peptide bradykinin-(1-5) (89·6 [0·0-2425·0], n = 21 vs 0·0 [0·0-374·0], n = 19, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0·001), and higher levels of MPO-DNA complexes (699·0 ng/mL [66·0-142621·0], n = 21 vs 70·5 [9·9-960·0], n = 19, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0·001) compared to patients without COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/em&gt; Our observations support the hypothesis that dysregulation of the kallikrein-kinin system might occur in mechanically ventilated patients with severe pulmonary disease, which might help to explain the clinical presentation of patients with severe COVID-19 developing pulmonary oedema and thromboembolic complications. Therefore, targeting the kallikrein-kinin system should be further explored as a potential treatment option for patients with severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of programmed cell death-related gene signature and associated regulatory axis in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35991562/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35991562/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Numerous studies have suggested that programmed cell death (PCD) pathways play vital roles in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the specific mechanisms underlying cell death during cerebral I/R injury have yet to be completely clarified. There is thus a need to identify the PCD-related gene signatures and the associated regulatory axes in cerebral I/R injury, which should provide novel therapeutic targets against cerebral I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We analyzed transcriptome signatures of brain tissue samples from mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and matched controls, and identified differentially expressed genes related to the three types of PCD(apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis). We next performed functional enrichment analysis and constructed PCD-related competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks. We also conducted hub gene analysis to identify hub nodes and key regulatory axes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Fifteen PCD-related genes were identified. Functional enrichment analysis showed that they were particularly associated with corresponding PCD-related biological processes, inflammatory response, and reactive oxygen species metabolic processes. The apoptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network was constructed, which included 24 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), 41 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 4 messenger RNAs (mRNAs); the necroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network included 16 lncRNAs, 20 miRNAs, and 6 mRNAs; and the pyroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network included 15 lncRNAs, 18 miRNAs, and 6 mRNAs. Hub gene analysis identified hub nodes in each PCD-related ceRNA regulatory network and seven key regulatory axes in total, namely, lncRNA Malat1/miR-181a-5p/Mapt, lncRNA Malat1/miR-181b-5p/Mapt, lncRNA Neat1/miR-181a-5p/Mapt, and lncRNA Neat1/miR-181b-5p/Mapt for the apoptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network; lncRNA Neat1/miR-181a-5p/Tnf for the necroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network; lncRNA Malat1/miR-181c-5p/Tnf for the pyroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network; and lncRNAMalat1/miR-181a-5p for both necroptosis-related and pyroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The results of this study supported the hypothesis that these PCD pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and PANoptosis) and crosstalk among them might be involved in ischemic stroke and that the key nodes and regulatory axes identified in this study might play vital roles in regulating the above processes. This may offer new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying cell death during cerebral I/R injury and provide new therapeutic targets for neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USP25 Deficiency Exacerbates Acute Pancreatitis via Up-Regulating TBK1-NF-κB Signaling in Macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35934222/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Severe acute pancreatitis can easily lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome and death. Macrophages are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis (AP), and macrophage activation correlates with disease severity. In this study, we examined the role of ubiquitin-specific protease 25, a deubiquitinating enzyme and known regulator of macrophages, in the pathogenesis of AP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used L-arginine, cerulein, and choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet-induced models of AP in &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice and wild-type mice. We also generated bone marrow &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; chimeric mice and initiated L-arginine-mediated AP. Primary acinar cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from wild-type and &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice to dissect molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our results show that Usp25 deficiency exacerbates pancreatic and lung injury, neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, and systemic inflammatory responses in L-arginine, cerulein, and choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet-induced models of AP. Bone marrow &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; chimeric mice challenged with L-arginine show that &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in macrophages exaggerates AP by up-regulating the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Similarly, in vitro data confirm that Usp25 deficiency enhances the TBK1-NF-κB pathway, leading to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow-derived macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in macrophages enhances TBK1-NF-κB signaling, and the induction of inflammatory chemokines and type I interferon-related genes exacerbates pancreatic and lung injury in AP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Noninvasive imaging of the lung NETosis by anti-Ly6G iron oxide nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35991979/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is challenging to visualize noninvasively the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, known as NETosis, and therefore difficult to monitor disease progression. A desirable molecular imaging probe is the iron oxide nanoparticle (NP) that could induce reactive oxygen species. Here, we used C57BL/6 mice with pristane-induced lupus, which mimics systemic lupus erythematosus. Administration of anti-Ly6G antibody-conjugated NP allowed detection of NETosis with fluorescent molecular imaging, as evidenced by flow cytometric analysis of citrullinated histone H3 expression in lung neutrophils. This finding was consistent with NP-induced blood NETosis in a spontaneous lupus model of B6.MRL-&lt;em&gt;lpr&lt;/em&gt; mice. &lt;em&gt;A chronic&lt;/em&gt; assessment was performed in which the lupus mice were protected from enhanced oxidative burst by anti-Ly6G NP. This NP can migrate from the peritoneal cavity to the lungs, as visualized by magnetic particle imaging. Overall, our study provides evidence for a highly sensitive assessment of NETosis in lupus through magnetic particle imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Piceatannol-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway inhibition contributes to the alleviation of oxidative injury and collagen synthesis during pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35932616/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piceatannol lightened oxidative injury and collagen synthesis in lung tissues during pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piceatannol inhibited the activation and collagen synthesis of TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAK2 activation abolished the effects of piceatannol in TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is characterized by oxidative injury and excessive collagen synthesis in lung fibroblasts, causing impaired pulmonary function and chronic lung injury. Piceatannol, a dietary polyphenol, possesses vital pharmacological effects in metabolic disorders, cancers, cardiovascular disease and infectious disease; however, its role in PF is still not completely elucidated. Mice (8 to 10 weeks old) were administered bleomycin (BLM) intratracheally (2 U/kg) to establish an in vivo PF model. Murine primary lung fibroblasts were isolated and stimulated with TGF-β (10 ng/mL) for 48 h to induce its activation. Meanwhile, mice or primary lung fibroblasts were treated with different doses of piceatannol to observe its protective roles. Pulmonary function and arterial blood gas were detected to assess pulmonary physiological status. Collagen deposition and the mRNA levels of profibrotic genes were determined by H&amp;amp;E staining and RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the protein and mRNA markers, as well as end-product of oxidative stress were detected in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that pulmonary function was significantly impaired in BLM-induced mice, accompanied by elevated oxidative stress and excessive collagen synthesis. Piceatannol significantly improved pulmonary function and decreased oxidative injury as well as collagen synthesis in mice with PF. Mechanically, piceatannol treatment significantly inhibited the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in BLM-induced mice and TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts. Additional findings also demonstrated that coumermycin A1 (C-A1), an agonist of JAK2, could abolish the effects of piceatannol on TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts and reactivated the phosphorylation STAT3. Taken together, our study demonstrated that piceatannol could protect against oxidative injury and collagen synthesis during PF in a JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent evidence for toxic effects of NH3 exposure on lung injury: Protective effects of L-selenomethionine</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35999759/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ammonia is a typical air pollutant, which has a strong toxic effect on respiratory system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ammonia exposure causes lung damage by oxidative stress and energy metabolism disorder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROS-mediated excessive autophagy is important mechanisms of ammonia toxicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L-selenomethionine can mitigate the toxic effect of ammonia exposure on lungs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a common air pollutant, which poses a serious threat to farm animals. L-selenomethionine is organic selenium (Se), which can inhibit intracellular ROS generation, block ROS-dependent autophagy, promote mitochondrial energy metabolism, and enhance the body&amp;rsquo;s immunity. Lung, as an important organ of the respiratory system, is highly susceptible to the toxic effects of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. However, there were few studies on the mechanism of toxic effects of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on lung tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on the lungs in pigs and the alleviating effect of L-selenomethionine. Twenty-four Large White-Duroc-Min pigs were randomly assigned to 4 groups: control group, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group, Se group, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +Se group. The results showed that exposure to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; caused damage and inflammation in lung tissues and significantly increased blood NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; concentration. NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; induced changes of oxidative stress indexes (GSH, GSH-Px, SOD, MDA, Keap1, Nrf2, and HO-1) and expressions of energy metabolism related genes (HK1, HK2, PFK, PK, LDHA, and HIF-1α). Ultrastructure showed that mitochondrial damage and autophagosome increased significantly, and the expression levels of autophagy related genes (Beclin1, ATG5, ATG7, ATG10, and p62) changed. However, the addition of L-selenomethionine alleviated the above changes, but there was still a significant difference compared with the control group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). This finding can provide a new evidence for mitigation of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Streptococcal autolysin promotes dysfunction of swine tracheal epithelium by interacting with vimentin</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35921364/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a major zoonotic pathogen resulting in manifestations as pneumonia and septic shock. The upper respiratory tract is typically thought to be the main colonization and entry site of SS2 in pigs, but the mechanism through which it penetrates the respiratory barrier is still unclear. In this study, a mutant with low invasive potential to swine tracheal epithelial cells (STECs) was screened from the TnYLB-1 transposon insertion mutant library of SS2, and the interrupted gene was identified as autolysin (atl). Compared to wild-type (WT) SS2, Δatl mutant exhibited lower ability to penetrate the tracheal epithelial barrier in a mouse model. Purified Atl also enhanced SS2 translocation across STEC monolayers in Transwell inserts. Furthermore, Atl redistributed the tight junctions (TJs) in STECs through myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) signaling, which led to increased barrier permeability. Using mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), pull-down, bacterial two-hybrid and saturation binding experiments, we showed that Atl binds directly to vimentin. CRISPR/Cas9-targeted deletion of vimentin in STECs (VIM KO STECs) abrogated the capacity of SS2 to translocate across the monolayers, SS2-induced phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) and MLCK transcription, indicating that vimentin is indispensable for MLCK activation. Consistently, vimentin null mice were protected from SS2 infection and exhibited reduced tracheal and lung injury. Thus, MLCK-mediated epithelial barrier opening caused by the Atl-vimentin interaction is found to be likely the key mechanism by which SS2 penetrates the tracheal epithelium.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Total flavonoids of Inula japonica alleviated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting the sEH activity: Insights from lipid metabolomics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150346/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/36150346/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe respiratory disease characterized by diffuse lung interstitial and respiratory distress and pulmonary edema with a mortality rate of 35%-40%. Inula japonica Thunb., known as &amp;ldquo;Xuan Fu Hua&amp;rdquo; in Chinese, is a traditional Chinese medicine Inulae Flos to use for relieving cough, eliminating expectorant, and preventing bacterial infections in the clinic, and possesses an anti-pulmonary fibrosis effect. However, the effect and action mechanism of I. japonica on ALI is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanism of total flavonoids of I. japonica (TFIJ) in the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design and methods:&lt;/em&gt; A mouse ALI model was established through administration of LPS by the intratracheal instillation. Protective effects of TFIJ in the inflammation and oxidative stress were studied in LPS-induced ALI mice based on inflammatory and oxidative stress factors, including MDA, MPO, SOD, and TNF-α. Lipid metabolomics, bioinformatics, Western blot, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry were performed to reveal the potential mechanism of TFIJ in the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; TFIJ significantly alleviated the interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells and the collapse of the alveoli in LPS-induced ALI mice. Lipid metabolomics demonstrated that TFIJ could significantly affect the CYP2J/sEH-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism, such as 11,12-EET, 14,15-EET, 8,9-DHET, 11,12-DHET, and 14,15-DHET, revealing that sEH was the potential target of TFIJ, which was further supported by the recombinant sEH-mediated the substrate hydrolysis in vitro (IC50 = 1.18 μg/ml). Inhibition of sEH by TFIJ alleviated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress via the MAPK, NF-κB, and Nrf2 signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These results demonstrated that TFIJ could suppress the sEH activity to stabilize the level of EETs, allowing the alleviation of the pathological course of lung injury in LPS-treated mice, which suggested that TFIJ could serve as the potential agents in the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel circular RNA, circIgfbp2, links neural plasticity and anxiety through targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress-induced synapse dysfunction after traumatic brain injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35918398/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to different neurological and psychiatric disorders. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly expressed in the nervous system and enriched in synapses; yet, the underlying role and mechanisms of circRNAs in neurological impairment and dysfunction are still not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the expression of circRNAs and their relation with neurological dysfunction after TBI. RNA-Seq was used to detect differentially expressed circRNAs in injured brain tissue, revealing that circIgfbp2 was significantly increased. Up-regulated hsa_circ_0058195, which was highly homologous to circIgfbp2, was further confirmed in the cerebral cortex specimens and serum samples of patients after TBI. Moreover, correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between hsa_circ_0058195 levels and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale scores in these subjects. Furthermore, knockdown of circIgfbp2 in mice relieved anxiety-like behaviors and sleep disturbances induced by TBI. Knockdown of circIgfbp2 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treated HT22 cells alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction, while its overexpression reversed the process. Mechanistically, we discovered that circIgfbp2 targets miR-370-3p to regulate BACH1, and down-regulating BACH1 alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress-induced synapse dysfunction. In conclusion, inhibition of circIgfbp2 alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress-induced synapse dysfunction after TBI through the miR-370-3p/BACH1/HO-1 axis. Thus, circIgfbp2 might be a novel therapeutic target for anxiety and sleep disorders after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Persistent DNA damage underlies tubular cell polyploidization and progression to chronic kidney disease in kidneys deficient in the DNA repair protein FAN1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35931300/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defective DNA repair pathways contribute to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in humans. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA damage-induced CKD pathogenesis are not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of tubular cell DNA damage in the pathogenesis of CKD using mice in which the DNA repair protein Fan1 was knocked out. The phenotype of these mice is orthologous to the human DNA damage syndrome, karyomegalic interstitial nephritis (KIN). Inactivation of Fan1 in kidney proximal tubule cells sensitized the kidneys to genotoxic and obstructive injury characterized by replication stress and persistent DNA damage response activity. Accumulation of DNA damage in Fan1 tubular cells induced epithelial dedifferentiation and tubular injury. Characteristic to KIN, cells with chronic DNA damage failed to complete mitosis and underwent polyploidization. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that polyploidization was caused by the overexpression of DNA replication factors CDT1 and CDC6 in FAN1 deficient cells. Mechanistically, inhibiting DNA replication with Roscovitine reduced tubular injury, blocked the development of KIN and mitigated kidney function in these Fan1 knockout mice. Thus, our data delineate a mechanistic pathway by which persistent DNA damage in the kidney tubular cells leads to kidney injury and development of CKD. Furthermore, therapeutic modulation of cell cycle activity may provide an opportunity to mitigate the DNA damage response induced CKD progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosgene (COCl2) gas is a chemical intermediate of high-volume production with numerous industrial applications worldwide. Due to its high toxicity, accidental exposure to phosgene leads to various chemical injuries, primarily resulting in chemical-induced lung injury due to inhalation. Initially, the illness is mild and presents as coughing, chest tightness, and wheezing; however, within a few hours, symptoms progress to chronic respiratory depression, refractory pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, which may contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even death in severe cases. Despite rapid advances in medicine, effective treatments for phosgene-inhaled poisoning are lacking. Elucidating the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of acute inhalation toxicity caused by phosgene is necessary for the development of appropriate therapeutics. In this review, we discuss extant literature on relevant mechanisms and therapeutic strategies to highlight novel ideas for the treatment of phosgene-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accurate identification of kidney injury progression via a fluorescent biosensor array</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the progress of kidney injury may aid the effective treatment and intervention. Herein, we developed a fluorescent biosensor array for instantaneous and accurate identification of the kidney injury progression via &amp;ldquo;doubled&amp;rdquo; signals. The multichannel biosensor array consisted of polydopamine-polyethyleneimine (PDA-PEI) and multicolor-labelled different length of DNAs including AAAAA-Cyanine7 (5A-Cy7), AAAAAAAAAA-Texas Red (10A-Texas Red), and AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-VIC (20A-VIC). Facing to the variety of protein in urine with alterable charge accompanied with different progress of kidney injury, the composition of urine replaces the DNA signal molecules, forming their special fluorescence patterns. Taking the size of protein into consideration, the original three variables induced by the protein charge were extended to six variables induced by the two factors of protein particle size and charge difference, which could provide a more accurate strategy to identify the progress of kidney injury. Notably, this strategy not only opened up new perspective for identification the progress of kidney injury via the size and charge of urine protein, but also improved the resolving power of sensor array by increasing the number of sensor elements for extending their potential application to various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cysteinyl Maresins Reprogram Macrophages to Protect Mice from Streptococcus pneumoniae after Influenza A Virus Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35913160/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Excess mortality during IAV epidemics and pandemics is attributable to secondary bacterial infections, particularly pneumonia caused by &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;. Resident alveolar macrophages (rAMs) are early responders to respiratory infections that coordinate initial host defense responses. Maresin conjugates in tissue regeneration (MCTRs) are recently elucidated cysteinyl maresins that are produced by and act on macrophages. Roles for MCTRs in responses to respiratory infections remain to be determined. Here, IAV infection led to transient decreases in rAM numbers. Repopulated lung macrophages displayed transcriptional alterations 21 days post-IAV with prolonged susceptibility to secondary pneumococcal infection. Administration of a mix of MCTR1 to 3 or MCTR3 alone post-IAV decreased lung inflammation and bacterial load 48 and 72 h after secondary pneumococcal infection. MCTR-exposed rAMs had increased migration and phagocytosis of &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, reduced secretion of CXCL1, and a reversion toward baseline levels of several IAV-induced pneumonia susceptibility genes. Together, MCTRs counter regulated post-IAV changes in rAMs to promote a rapid return of bacteria host defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a serious and common complication of IAV infection, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. New host-directed approaches are needed to complement antibiotics to better address this important global infectious disease. Here, we show that harnessing endogenous resolution mechanisms for inflammation by exogenous administration of a family of specialized proresolving mediators (i.e., cys-MCTRs) increased macrophage resilience mechanisms after IAV to protect against secondary infection from &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular histones induce inflammation and senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells by activating the AMPK/FOXO4 signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35913584/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is an abnormal immune-inflammatory response that is mainly caused by infection. It can lead to life-threatening organ dysfunction and death. Severely damaged tissue cells will release intracellular histones into the circulation as damage-related molecular patterns (DAMPs) to accelerate the systemic immune response. Although various histone-related cytotoxicity mechanisms have been explored, those that affect extracellular histones involved in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction are yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were stimulated with different concentrations of histones, and cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay. Cellular senescence was assessed by SA β-gal staining. C57BL/6 mice were treated with histones with or without BML-275 treatment. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 inflammasome proteins. The interaction of NLRP3 and ASC was detected by CoIP and immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we found that extracellular histones induced senescence and inflammatory response in a dose-dependent manner in cultured VSMCs. Histone treatment significantly promoted apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) as well as NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) interaction of inflammasomes in VSMCs. Forkhead box protein O4 (FOXO4), which is a downstream effector molecule of extracellular histones, was found to be involved in histone-regulated VSMC inflammatory response and senescence. Furthermore, the 5&amp;rsquo;-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway was confirmed to mediate extracellular histone-induced FOXO4 expression, and blocking this signaling pathway with an inhibitor can suppress vascular inflammation induced by extracellular histones &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Extracellular histones induce inflammation and senescence in VSMCs, and blocking the AMPK/FOXO4 pathway is a potential target for the treatment of histonemediated organ injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Monocyte Signature Associated with Herpes Simplex Virus Reactivation and Neurological Recovery after Brain Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35486851/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Brain injury induces systemic immunosuppression, increasing the risk of viral reactivations and altering neurological recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; To determine if systemic immune alterations and lung replication of herpesviridae are associated and can help predict outcomes after brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with severe brain injury requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. We systematically searched for respiratory herpes simplex virus (HSV) replications in tracheal aspirates. We also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and in vitro functional assays of monocytes and CD4 T cells collected on Day 1 to characterize the immune response to severe acute brain injury. The primary outcome was the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/em&gt; In 344 patients with severe brain injury, lung HSV reactivations were observed in 39% of the 232 patients seropositive for HSV and independently associated with poor neurological recovery at 6 months (hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.57). Weighted gene coexpression network analyses of the transcriptomic response of monocytes to brain injury defined a module of 721 genes, including PD-L1 and CD80, enriched for the binding DNA motif of the transcriptional factor Zeb2 and whose ontogenic analyses revealed decreased IFN-γ-mediated and antiviral response signaling pathways. This monocyte signature was preserved in a validation cohort and predicted the neurological outcome at 6 months with good accuracy (area under the curve, 0.786; 95% confidence interval, 0.593-0.978).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; A specific monocyte signature is associated with HSV reactivation and predicts poor recovery after brain injury. The alterations of the immune control of herpesviridae replication are understudied and represent a novel therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil membrane engineered HucMSC sEVs alleviate cisplatin-induced AKI by enhancing cellular uptake and targeting</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35918718/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells-derived small extracellular vesicles (hucMSC-sEVs) have been demonstrated as a therapeutic agent to prevent and treat cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). However, hucMSC-sEVs still face many problems and challenges in the repair and treatment of tissue injury, including short circulation time, insufficient targeting, and low therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, we constructed engineered hybrid vesicles fused with nanovesicles derived from human neutrophil membranes and hucMSC-sEVs, named neutrophil membrane engineered hucMSC-sEVs (NEX). NEX significantly enhanced the targeting of hucMSC-sEVs to injured kidney tissues, improved the impaired renal function via reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, promoted the proliferation of renal tissue cells, and inhibited renal cell apoptosis in vivo. In addition, NEX enhanced hucMSC-sEVs uptake by NRK52E cells, but inhibited its uptake by RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, administration of NEX reduced cellular oxidative stress and promoted proliferation of NRK52E cells treated with cisplatin in vitro. In summary, our findings indicate that this design of a universal approach enhances the targeting and therapeutic efficacy of hucMSC-sEVs in kidney tissue regeneration, and provides new evidence promoting its clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of PP2A /NLRP3 signaling pathway in ambient particulate matter 2.5 induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35926746/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambient particulate matter 2.5 (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) exposure has been linked to pulmonary fibrosis. However, the key signaling pathways remained unclear. In the present study, we applied a mouse model with myeloid-specific deletion of Ppp2r1a gene (encoding protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) A subunit) to identify the key signaling pathways involved in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced pulmonary fibrosis. PP2A Aα-/- homozygote mice and matched wild-type (WT) littermates were exposed to filtered air (FA), unfiltered air (UA), and concentrated PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; (CA) in a real-ambient PM exposure system for 8 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively. The mice exposed to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; displayed a progressive inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, the expressions of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, caspase-1, ASC and IL-1β were increased in mice lung following PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, indicating PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure caused pulmonary inflammation by the NLRP3 pathways activation. Furthermore, the effects of PM exposure on pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, oxidative stress, and pulmonary function damage were significantly enhanced in PP2A-/- mice compared to WT mice, indicating the role of PP2A in the regulation of pulmonary injury induced by PM exposure. In vitro study confirmed that PP2A was involved in the PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced inflammation response and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Importantly, we identified PP2A regulated the activation of NLRP3 pathways by direct dephosphorylating IRE1α in response to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PP2A-IRE1α-NLRP3 signaling pathway played a crucial role in regulating the inflammation response, triggering the lung fibrogenesis upon PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Our findings provide new insights into regulatory role of PP2A in human diseases upon the PM exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>YAP1 alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35979359/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a phospholipid peroxidation-mediated and iron-dependent cell death form, involved in sepsis-induced organ injury and other lung diseases. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a key regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, could target multiple ferroptosis regulators. Herein, this study aimed to explore the involvement of ferroptosis in the etiopathogenesis of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and demonstrate that YAP1 could disrupt ferritinophagy and moderate sepsis-induced ALI. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models were constructed in wild-type (WT) and pulmonary epithelium-conditional knockout (YAP1f/f) mice to induce ALI, while MLE-12 cells with or without YAP1 overexpression were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. In-vivo modes showed that YAP1 knockout aggravated CLP-induced ALI and also accelerated pulmonary ferroptosis, as presented by the downregulated expression of GPX4, FTH1, and SLC7A11, along with the upregulated expression of SFXN1 and NCOA4. Transcriptome research identified these key genes and ferroptosis pathways involved in sepsis-induced ALI. In-vitro modes consistently verified that YAP1 deficiency boosted the ferrous iron accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction in response to LPS. Furthermore, the co-IP assay revealed that YAP1 overexpression could prevent the degradation of ferritin to a mass of Fe2+ (ferritinophagy) via disrupting the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction, which blocked the transport of cytoplasmic Fe2+ into the mitochondria via the mitochondrial membrane protein (SFXN1), further reducing the generation of mitochondrial ROS. Therefore, these findings revealed that YAP1 could inhibit ferroptosis in a ferritinophagy-mediated manner, thus alleviating sepsis-induced ALI, which may provide a new approach to the therapeutic orientation for sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cellular communication network 2 (connective tissue growth factor) aggravates acute DNA damage and subsequent DNA damage response-senescence-fibrosis following kidney ischemia reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35921911/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic allograft dysfunction with progressive fibrosis of unknown cause remains a major issue after kidney transplantation, characterized by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). One hypothesis to account for this is that spontaneous progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis following IRI is driven by cellular senescence evolving from a prolonged, unresolved DNA damage response (DDR). Since cellular communication network factor 2 ((CCN2), formerly called connective tissue growth factor), an established mediator of kidney fibrosis, is also involved in senescence-associated pathways, we investigated the relation between CCN2 and cellular senescence following kidney transplantation. Tubular CCN2 overexpression was found to be associated with DDR, loss of kidney function and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in both the early and the late phase in human kidney allograft biopsies. Consistently, CCN2 deficient mice developed reduced senescence and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the late phase; six weeks after experimental IRI. Moreover, tubular DDR markers and plasma urea were less elevated in CCN2 knockout than in wild-type mice. Finally, CCN2 administration or overexpression in epithelial cells induced upregulation of tubular senescence-associated genes including p21, while silencing of CCN2 alleviated DDR induced by anoxia-reoxygenation injury in cultured proximal tubule epithelial cells. Thus, our observations indicate that inhibition of CCN2 can mitigate IRI-induced acute kidney injury, DNA damage, and the subsequent DDR-senescence-fibrosis sequence. Hence, targeting CCN2 might help to protect the kidney from transplantation-associated post-IRI chronic kidney dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Uncontrolled inflammation is an important factor in the occurrence and development of acute lung injury (ALI). Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), a plasma membrane-anchored receptor, takes part in the pathological process of a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. However, the role of Fn14 in ALI has not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate whether the activation of Fn14 exacerbated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In vivo, ALI was induced by intratracheal LPS-challenge combined with/without Fn14 receptor blocker aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) treatment in C57BL/6J mice. Following LPS administration, the survival rate, lung tissue injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, inflammatory factor secretion, oxidative stress, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation were assessed. In vitro, primary murine macrophages were used to evaluate the underlying mechanism by which Fn14 activated the NLRP3 inflammasome. Lentivirus was used to silence Fn14 to observe its effect on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we found that Fn14 expression was significantly increased in the lungs of LPS-induced ALI mice. The inhibition of Fn14 with ATA downregulated the protein expression of Fn14 in the lungs and improved the survival rate of mice receiving a lethal dose of LPS. ATA also attenuated lung tissue damage by decreasing the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, reducing inflammation, and suppressing oxidative stress. Importantly, we found that ATA strongly inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the lungs of ALI mice. Furthermore, in vitro, TWEAK, a natural ligand of Fn14, amplified the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the primary murine macrophage. By contrast, inhibition of Fn14 with shRNA decreased the expression of Fn14, NLRP3, Caspase-1 p10, and Caspase-1 p20, and the production of IL-1β and IL-18. Furthermore, the activation of Fn14 promoted the production of reactive oxygen species and inhibited the activation of Nrf2-HO-1 in activated macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study first reports that the activation of Fn14 aggravates ALI by amplifying the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, blocking Fn14 may be a potential way to treat ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PTPRO knockdown protects against inflammation in hemorrhage shock-induced lung injury involving the NF-κB signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35906634/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Hemorrhage shock (HS) is characterized by decreased tissue oxygenation and organ damage due to severe blood loss. Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) is abnormally up-regulated in the rat lungs after trauma/HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of PTPRO in lung inflammation following HS, we established a rat model of HS via withdrawing blood by a catheter inserted into the femoral artery followed by resuscitation. The rats were infected with lentivirus harboring short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting PTPRO by intratracheal instillation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; PTPRO was significantly up-regulated in rat lungs after HS. PTPRO knockdown enhanced epithelial integrity and reduced capillary leakage by up-regulating tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin (OCC) in the lungs. Besides, HS-induced myeloperoxidase activity and inflammatory cell infiltration was mitigated by PTPRO knockdown. The expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-2, MCP-1, and KC) in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was regressed after PTPRO knockdown. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway was involved in HS-induced lung inflammation. PTPRO down-regulation inhibited the NF-κB pathway activation by suppressing the phosphorylation of NF-κB and its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Taken together, we demonstrated that PTPRO knockdown may contribute to attenuating inflammation in HS-induced lung injury via inhibiting NF-κB pathway activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of neutrophil extracellular traps in acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35967320/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a heterogeneous inflammatory condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. Neutrophils play a key role in the development of different forms of ALI, and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is emerging as a common pathogenic mechanism. NETs are essential in controlling pathogens, and their defective release or increased degradation leads to a higher risk of infection. However, NETs also contain several pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic molecules than can exacerbate thromboinflammation and lung tissue injury. To reduce NET-mediated lung damage and inflammation, DNase is frequently used in preclinical models of ALI due to its capability of digesting NET DNA scaffold. Moreover, recent advances in neutrophil biology led to the development of selective NET inhibitors, which also appear to reduce ALI in experimental models. Here we provide an overview of the role of NETs in different forms of ALI discussing existing gaps in our knowledge and novel therapeutic approaches to modulate their impact on lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA RMRP Contributes to the Development and Progression of Spinal Cord Injury by Regulating miR-766-5p/FAM83A Axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is known as a central nervous system disorder. Previous studies suggested that long-non-coding RNA RMRP (LncRNA RMRP) was abnormally expressed in SCI, but the potential underlying mechanism remains to be further explored. To explore the regulatory roles of LncRNA RMRP/miR-766-5p/FAM83A axis in SCI. Spinal T9 hemisection was performed on healthy adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats to establish the SCI rat models. The expressions of LncRNA RMRP in spinal cord of rats in different groups were examined by RT-qPCR. Moreover, AGE1.HN and PC12 cells were treated with hypoxic condition, and expression of LncRNA RMRP was examined by RT-qPCR methods. Furthermore, hypoxic PC12 cells were transfected with LncRNA RMRP OE, and the cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis were examined. Next, the direct targeting relationship between LncRNA RMRP and miR-766-5p, as well as miR-766-5p and FAM83A, was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. Finally, the effects of LncRNA RMRP/miR-766-5p/FAM83A axis on cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis were examined. LncRNA RMRP was downregulated in SCI rats and over-expression of LncRNA RMRP alleviated the SCI condition. LncRNA RMRP over-expression increased the viability and proliferation, and inhibited the apoptosis of hypoxic PC12 cells in vitro. miR-766-5p was confirmed as a target of LncRNA RMRP, and FAM83A was confirmed as a target of miR-766-5p. LncRNA RMRP could regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of hypoxic PC12 cells via regulating miR-766-5p/FAM83A axis in vitro. LncRNA RMRP may contribute to the pathogenesis of SCI via regulating miR-766-5p/FAM83A axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The EGFR/ErbB inhibitor neratinib modifies the neutrophil phosphoproteome and promotes apoptosis and clearance by airway macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35967296/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulated neutrophilic inflammation can be highly destructive in chronic inflammatory diseases due to prolonged neutrophil lifespan and continual release of histotoxic mediators in inflamed tissues. Therapeutic induction of neutrophil apoptosis, an immunologically silent form of cell death, may be beneficial in these diseases, provided that the apoptotic neutrophils are efficiently cleared from the tissue. Previous research in our group identified ErbB inhibitors as able to induce neutrophil apoptosis and reduce neutrophilic inflammation both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Here, we extend that work using a clinical ErbB inhibitor, neratinib, which has the potential to be repurposed in inflammatory diseases. We show that neratinib reduces neutrophilic migration o an inflammatory site in zebrafish larvae. Neratinib upregulates efferocytosis and reduces the number of persisting neutrophil corpses in mouse models of acute, but not chronic, lung injury, suggesting that the drug may have therapeutic benefits in acute inflammatory settings. Phosphoproteomic analysis of human neutrophils shows that neratinib modifies the phosphorylation of proteins regulating apoptosis, migration, and efferocytosis. This work identifies a potential mechanism for neratinib in treating acute lung inflammation by upregulating the clearance of dead neutrophils and, through examination of the neutrophil phosphoproteome, provides important insights into the mechanisms by which this may be occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Study on the Radiosensitivity of Radiation-Induced Lung Injury at the Acute Phase Based on Single-Cell Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35967301/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is the most common complication associated with chest tumors, such as lung and breast cancers, after radiotherapy; however, the pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing has laid the foundation for studying RILI at the cellular microenvironmental level. This study focused on changes during the acute pneumonitis stage of RILI at the cellular microenvironmental level and investigated the interactions between different cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; An acute RILI model in mice and a single-cell transcriptional library were established. Intercellular communication networks were constructed to study the heterogeneity and intercellular interactions among different cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A single-cell transcriptome map was established in a mouse model of acute lung injury. In total, 18,500 single-cell transcripts were generated, and 10 major cell types were identified. The heterogeneity and radiosensitivity of each cell type or subtype in the lung tissues during the acute stage were revealed. It was found that immune cells had higher radiosensitivity than stromal cells. Immune cells were highly heterogeneous in terms of radiosensitivity, while some immune cells had the characteristics of radiation resistance. Two groups of radiation-induced Cd8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Mki67&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and Cd4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cxcr6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; helper T cells were identified. The presence of these cells was verified using immunofluorescence. The ligand-receptor interactions were analyzed by constructing intercellular communication networks. These explained the origins of the cells and revealed that they had been recruited from endothelial cells to the inflammatory site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study revealed the heterogeneity of &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; radiosensitivity of different cell types in the lung at the initial stage post irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anoikis is a programmed cell death occurring upon cell detachment from the correct extracellular matrix, thus disrupting integrin ligation. It is a critical mechanism in preventing dysplastic cell growth or attachment to an inappropriate matrix. Anoikis prevents detached epithelial cells from colonizing elsewhere and is thus essential for tissue homeostasis and development. As anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, two features associated with anoikis resistance, are crucial steps during tumour progression and metastatic spreading of cancer cells, anoikis deregulation has now evoked particular attention from the scientific community. The aim of this review is to analyse the molecular mechanisms governing both anoikis and anoikis resistance, focusing on their regulation in physiological processes, as well as in several diseases, including metastatic cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oral IRAK4 inhibitor BAY-1834845 prevents acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36076574/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRAK4 inhibition is a potentially feasible treatment for ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BAY-1834845 shows unexpectedly discrepant efficacy in vivo with PF-06650833.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BAY-1834845 inhibits natural immunity signaling stronger than dexamethasone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lethal clinical entity that has become an emergency event with the outbreak of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no well-proven pharmacotherapies except dexamethasone. This study is aimed to evaluate IRAK4 inhibitors as a potential treatment for ARDS-cytokine release syndrome (CRS). We applied two IRAK4 inhibitors, BAY-1834845 and PF-06650833 to an inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS mouse model with control of high dose dexamethasone (10 mg/kg). Unexpectedly, although both compounds had excellent IC50 on IRAK4 kinase activity, only BAY-1834845 but not PF-06650833 or high dose dexamethasone could significantly prevent lung injury according to a blinded pathology scoring. Further, only BAY-1834845 and BAY-1834845 combined with dexamethasone could effectively improve the injury score of pre-existed ARDS. Compared with PF-06650833 and high dose dexamethasone, BAY-1834845 remarkably decreased inflammatory cells infiltrating lung tissue and neutrophil count in BALF. BAY-1834845, DEX, and the combination of the two agents could decrease BALF total T cells, monocyte, and macrophages. In further cell type enrichment analysis based on lung tissue RNA-seq, both BAY-1834845 and dexamethasone decreased signatures of inflammatory cells and effector lymphocytes. Interestingly, unlike the dexamethasone group, BAY-1834845 largely preserved the signatures of naïve lymphocytes and stromal cells such as endothelial cells, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells. Differential gene enrichment suggested that BAY-1834845 downregulated genes more efficiently than dexamethasone, especially TNF, IL-17, interferon, and Toll-like receptor signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting ETosis by miR-155 inhibition mitigates mixed granulocytic asthmatic lung inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35958610/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthma is phenotypically heterogeneous with several distinctive pathological mechanistic pathways. Previous studies indicate that neutrophilic asthma has a poor response to standard asthma treatments comprising inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, it is important to identify critical factors that contribute to increased numbers of neutrophils in asthma patients whose symptoms are poorly controlled by conventional therapy. Leukocytes release chromatin fibers, referred to as extracellular traps (ETs) consisting of double-stranded (ds) DNA, histones, and granule contents. Excessive components of ETs contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma; however, it is unclear how ETs drive asthma phenotypes and whether they could be a potential therapeutic target. We employed a mouse model of severe asthma that recapitulates the intricate immune responses of neutrophilic and eosinophilic airway inflammation identified in patients with severe asthma. We used both a pharmacologic approach using miR-155 inhibitor-laden exosomes and genetic approaches using miR-155 knockout mice. Our data show that ETs are present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with mild asthma subjected to experimental subsegmental bronchoprovocation to an allergen and a severe asthma mouse model, which resembles the complex immune responses identified in severe human asthma. Furthermore, we show that miR-155 contributes to the extracellular release of dsDNA, which exacerbates allergic lung inflammation, and the inhibition of miR-155 results in therapeutic benefit in severe asthma mice. Our findings show that targeting dsDNA release represents an attractive therapeutic target for mitigating neutrophilic asthma phenotype, which is clinically refractory to standard care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress play critical roles in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colchicine (COL) mitigates severe acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury (SAP-ALI) in rats model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colchicine limits inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress in SAP-ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress contribute to the development of severe acute pancreatitis-associated acute lung injury (SAP-ALI). Currently, there is no curative treatment for SAP-ALI in the clinic. This study investigated the potential therapeutic role and mechanisms of colchicine in a rat model of SAP-ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized and administrated intragastrically with vehicle saline or colchicine (0.5 mg/kg/day) for seven days, followed by injecting sodium taurocholate to induce SAP-ALI. Together with a healthy control group of rats, their pancreatic and lung tissues and plasma samples were collected for histology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with the sham controls, the SAP group of rats with vehicle saline treatment displayed severe damages, inflammation with many neutrophil and macrophage infiltrates in pancreatic and lung tissues, accompanied by elevated levels of plasma interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which were significantly mitigated in colchicine-treated SAP + COL group of rats. Furthermore, colchicine treatment significantly attenuated nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)-p65, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 4-Hydroxynonenal expression, ROS production and cell apoptosis by decreasing caspase-3 cleavage, Bax expression, but increasing Bcl-2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in pancreatic and lung tissues, relative to the SAP group of rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Colchicine treatment significantly mitigated the severity of SAP-ALI by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in rats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular dysfunction is a hallmark of chronic diseases in elderly. The contribution of the vasculature to lung repair and fibrosis is not fully understood. Here, we performed an epigenetic and transcriptional analysis of lung endothelial cells (ECs) from young and aged mice during the resolution or progression of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. We identified the transcription factor ETS-related gene (ERG) as putative orchestrator of lung capillary homeostasis and repair, and whose function is dysregulated in aging. ERG dysregulation is associated with reduced chromatin accessibility and maladaptive transcriptional responses to injury. Loss of endothelial ERG enhances paracrine fibroblast activation in vitro, and impairs lung fibrosis resolution in young mice in vivo. scRNA-seq of ERG deficient mouse lungs reveales transcriptional and fibrogenic abnormalities resembling those associated with aging and human lung fibrosis, including reduced number of general capillary (gCap) ECs. Our findings demonstrate that lung endothelial chromatin remodeling deteriorates with aging leading to abnormal transcription, vascular dysrepair, and persistent fibrosis following injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interferon-β regulates proresolving lipids to promote the resolution of acute airway inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35878041/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberrant immune responses, including hyperresponsiveness to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, underlie acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Type I interferons confer antiviral activities and could also regulate the inflammatory response, whereas little is known about their actions to resolve aberrant inflammation. Here we report that interferon-β (IFN-β) exerts partially overlapping, but also cooperative actions with aspirin-triggered 15-epi-lipoxin A4 (15-epi-LXA4) and 17-epi-resolvin D1 to counter TLR9-generated cues to regulate neutrophil apoptosis and phagocytosis in human neutrophils. In mice, TLR9 activation impairs bacterial clearance, prolongs Escherichia coli-evoked lung injury, and suppresses production of IFN-β and the proresolving lipid mediators 15-epi-LXA4 and resolvin D1 (RvD1) in the lung. Neutralization of endogenous IFN-β delays pulmonary clearance of E. coli and aggravates mucosal injury. Conversely, treatment of mice with IFN-β accelerates clearance of bacteria, restores neutrophil phagocytosis, promotes neutrophil apoptosis and efferocytosis, and accelerates resolution of airway inflammation with concomitant increases in 15-epi-LXA4 and RvD1 production in the lungs. Pharmacological blockade of the lipoxin receptor ALX/FPR2 partially prevents IFN-β-mediated resolution. These findings point to a pivotal role of IFN-β in orchestrating timely resolution of neutrophil and TLR9 activation-driven airway inflammation and uncover an IFN-β-initiated resolution program, activation of an ALX/FPR2-centered, proresolving lipids-mediated circuit, for ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA): A potential therapeutic target in acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35873025/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and its severe form Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are the major cause of ICU death worldwide. ALI/ARDS is characterized by severe hypoxemia and inflammation that leads to poor lung compliance. Despite many advances in understanding and management, ALI/ARDS is still causing significant morbidity and mortality. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a fast-growing topic in lung inflammation and injury. lncRNA is a class of non-coding RNA having a length of more than 200 nucleotides. It has been a center of research for understanding the pathophysiology of various diseases in the past few years. Multiple studies have shown that lncRNAs are abundant in acute lung injury/injuries in mouse models and cell lines. By targeting these long non-coding RNAs, many investigators have demonstrated the alleviation of ALI in various mouse models. Therefore, lncRNAs show great promise as a therapeutic target in ALI. This review provides the current state of knowledge about the relationship between lncRNAs in various biological processes in acute lung injury and its use as a potential therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation promotes alveolar epithelial recovery by activating Hippo/YAP signaling after lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35973885/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The preferred configuration for bridging patients with respiratory failure while awaiting lung transplantation is venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO). However, the protective effect of VV ECMO on the lung, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the role of VV ECMO in preventing lung injury in vivo using a rat model. Additionally, the effects of Hippo/YAP signaling on alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2)-mediated alveolar epithelial recovery in VV ECMO rats were also investigated. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, RNA sequencing, lung injury, edema, and cytokine expression were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; VV ECMO significantly improved severe hypoxemia, reduced lung edema, and inflammatory response, and altered alveolar epithelial function, as indicated by reduced protein concentrations in BALF. This was associated with Hippo/YAP signaling activation, according to RNA sequencing analysis. Furthermore, we discovered that after VV ECMO, AT2 cells proliferated and differentiated, and this increase in AT2 cell activity was correlated to the increased nuclear expression of YAP, which is critical for alveolar epithelial recovery from lung injury. During VV ECMO, verteporfin-induced YAP inhibition and the loss of the oxygenator delayed lung alveolar epithelial recovery and led to a prolonged inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings suggest that VV ECMO protects against lung injury by activating the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. Strategies aimed at increasing YAP activity in AT2 cells could thus aid alveolar epithelial recovery, making VV ECMO easier for lung transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ACE2-like enzyme B38-CAP suppresses abdominal sepsis and severe acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35867642/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the carboxypeptidase to degrade angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and improves the pathologies of cardiovascular disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/acute lung injury. B38-CAP is a bacteria-derived ACE2-like carboxypeptidase as potent as human ACE2 and ameliorates hypertension, heart failure and SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury in mice. Recombinant B38-CAP is prepared with E. coli protein expression system more efficiently than recombinant soluble human ACE2. Here we show therapeutic effects of B38-CAP on abdominal sepsis- or acid aspiration-induced acute lung injury. ACE2 expression was downregulated in the lungs of mice with cecal ligation puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis or acid-induced lung injury thereby leading to upregulation of Ang II levels. Intraperitoneal injection of B38-CAP significantly decreased Ang II levels while upregulated angiotensin 1-7 levels. B38-CAP improved survival rate of the mice under sepsis. B38-CAP suppressed the pathologies of lung inflammation, improved lung dysfunction and downregulated elevated cytokine mRNA levels in the mice with acute lung injury. Thus, systemic treatment with an ACE2-like enzyme might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the patients with severe sepsis or ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ACSL4 is essential for radiation-induced intestinal injury by initiating ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35869042/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis is a newly recognized type of programmed cell death. With the method of RNA sequencing, we found that irradiation (IR) markedly increased the expression of ferroptosis promotive genes, whereas reduced the expression of ferroptosis suppressive genes in murine intestine tissues, when compared with those of liver and lung tissues. By using ferroptosis inducer RSL-3 and inhibitor liproxstatin-1, we found that ferroptosis is essential for IR-induced intestinal injury. Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) is an important component for ferroptosis execution, and we found that ACSL4 expression was significantly upregulated in irradiated intestine tissues, but not in liver or lung tissues. Antibacterial and antifungal regents reduced the expression of ASCL4 and protected against tissue injury in irradiated intestine tissues. Further studies showed that troglitazone, a ACSL4 inhibitor, succeeded to suppresses intestine lipid peroxidation and tissue damage after IR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Class IIa histone deacetylase inhibition ameliorates acute kidney injury by suppressing renal tubular cell apoptosis and enhancing autophagy and proliferation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35935816/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expression and function of histone deacetylases (HDACs) vary with cell types and pathological conditions. Our recent studies showed that pharmacological targeting class IIa HDACs attenuated renal fibrosis, but the effect of class IIa HDAC inhibition on acute kidney injury (AKI) remains unknown. In this study, we found that four class IIa HDACs (4, 5, 7, 9) were highly expressed in the kidney of folic acid (FA) and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced AKI in mice. Administration of TMP269, a potent and selective class IIa HDAC inhibitor, improved renal function and reduced tubular cell injury and apoptosis, with concomitant suppression of HDAC4 and elevation of acetyl-histone H3. Mechanistical studies showed that TMP269 treatment inhibited FA and I/R-induced caspase-3 cleavage, Bax expression and p53 phosphorylation. Conversely, TMP269 administration preserved expression of E-cadherin, BMP7, Klotho and Bcl-2 in injured kidneys. Moreover, TMP269 was effective in promoting cellular autophagy as indicated by increased expression of Atg7, beclin-1, and LC3II, and promoted renal tubular cell proliferation as shown by increased number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells and expression of cyclin E. Finally, blocking class IIa HDACs inhibited FA-and I/R-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, and p38, two signaling pathways associated with the pathogenesis of AKI. Collectively, these results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of class IIa HDACs protects against AKI through ameliorating apoptosis, enhancing autophagy and promoting proliferation of renal tubular cells by targeting multiple signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evaluation and Characterization of Post-Stroke Lung Damage in a Murine Model of Cerebral Ischemia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After stroke and other brain injuries, there is a high incidence of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute lung injury. The molecular mechanisms that drive the brain-lung interaction post-stroke have not yet been elucidated. We performed transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and sham surgery on C57BL/6J mice and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), serum, brain, and lung homogenate samples 24 h after surgery. A 92 proteins-panel developed by Olink Proteomics® was used to analyze the content in BALF and lung homogenates. MCAO animals had higher protein concentration levels in BALF than sham-controls, but these levels did not correlate with the infarct volume. No alteration in alveolar-capillary barrier permeability was observed. A total of 12 and 14 proteins were differentially expressed between the groups (FDR &amp;lt; 0.1) in BALF and lung tissue homogenates, respectively. Of those, HGF, TGF-α, and CCL2 were identified as the most relevant to this study. Their protein expression patterns were verified by ELISA. This study confirmed that post-stroke lung damage was not associated with increased lung permeability or cerebral ischemia severity. Furthermore, the dysregulation of HGF, TGF-α, and CCL2 in BALF and lung tissue after ischemia could play an important role in the molecular mechanisms underlying stroke-induced lung damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Allergic respiratory diseases have increased dramatically due to air pollution over the past few decades. However, studies are limited on the effects of inorganic components and particulate matter with different particle sizes in smog on allergic diseases, and the possible molecular mechanism of inducing allergies has not been thoroughly studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Four common mineral elements with different particle sizes in smog particles were selected, including Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We studied the relationship and molecular mechanism of smog particle composition, particle size, and allergic reactions using mast cells, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) model, and an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic mouse model in vitro and in vivo, combined with transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission X-ray microscopy analysis, and transcriptome sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Only 20 nm SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles significantly increased β-hexosaminidase release, based on dinitrophenol (DNP)-human serum albumin (HSA) stimulation, from IgE-sensitized mast cells, while other particles did not. Meanwhile, the PCA model showed that Evan&amp;rsquo;s blue extravasation in mice was increased after treatment with nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles. Nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles exposure in the asthmatic mouse model caused an enhancement of allergic airway inflammation as manifested by OVA-specific serum IgE, airway hyperresponsiveness, lung inflammation injury, mucous cell metaplasia, cytokine expression, mast cell activation, and histamine secretion, which were significantly increased. Nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles exposure did not affect the expression of FcϵRI or the ability of mast cells to bind IgE but synergistically activated mast cells by enhancing the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, especially the phosphorylation levels of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. The ERK inhibitors showed a significant inhibitory effect in reducing β-hexosaminidase release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results indicated that nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles stimulation might synergistically activate IgE-sensitized mast cells by enhancing the MAPK signaling pathway and that nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles exposure could exacerbate allergic inflammation. Our experimental results provide useful information for preventing and treating allergic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PTP1B inhibitors protect against acute lung injury and regulate CXCR4 signaling in neutrophils</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a lethal condition with limited treatment options and currently a common global cause of death due to COVID-19. ARDS secondary to transfusion-related ALI (TRALI) has been recapitulated preclinically by anti-MHC-I antibody administration to LPS-primed mice. In this model, we demonstrate that inhibitors of PTP1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates signaling pathways of fundamental importance to homeostasis and inflammation, prevented lung injury and increased survival. Treatment with PTP1B inhibitors attenuated the aberrant neutrophil function that drives ALI and was associated with release of myeloperoxidase, suppression of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and inhibition of neutrophil migration. Mechanistically, reduced signaling through the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, particularly to the activation of PI3Kγ/AKT/mTOR, was essential for these effects, linking PTP1B inhibition to promoting an aged-neutrophil phenotype. Considering that dysregulated activation of neutrophils has been implicated in sepsis and causes collateral tissue damage, we demonstrate that PTP1B inhibitors improved survival and ameliorated lung injury in an LPS-induced sepsis model and improved survival in the cecal ligation and puncture-induced (CLP-induced) sepsis model. Our data highlight the potential for PTP1B inhibition to prevent ALI and ARDS from multiple etiologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mucin 1 Inhibits Ferroptosis and Sensitizes Vitamin E to Alleviate Sepsis-Induced Acute Lung Injury through GSK3 β/Keap1-Nrf2-GPX4 Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35910848/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35910848/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic form of programmed cell death, which may be related to the occurrence and development of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/acute lung injury (ALI). Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a kind of macromolecule transmembrane glycoprotein. Previous studies have shown that MUC1 could relieve ALI in sepsis and predict whether sepsis patients would develop into ARDS. However, the role of MUC1 in the ferroptosis of sepsis-induced ALI/ARDS remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Sera samples from 50 patients with sepsis/septic shock were used to detect iron metabolism-related markers. Western blot and qRT-PCR were conducted to detect the expression levels of ferroptosis-related genes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to evaluate inflammatory factors. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to assess morphological changes of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that the iron metabolism-related indicators in sepsis-induced ARDS patients changed significantly, suggesting the iron metabolism disorder. The expression levels of ferroptosis-related genes in lung tissues of sepsis had marked changes, and the lipid peroxidation levels increased, while Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) could reverse the above results, which confirmed the occurrence of ferroptosis. In terms of mechanism studies, inhibition of MUC1 dimerization could increase the expression level of Keap1, reduce the phosphorylation level of GSK3β, inhibit the entry of Nrf2 into the nucleus, further inhibit the expression level of GPX4, enhance the lipid peroxidation level of lung tissues, trigger ferroptosis, and aggravate lung injury. Besides, inhibiting MUC1 reversed the alleviating effect of vitamin E on ALI caused by sepsis, increased the aggregation of inflammatory cells in lung tissues, and aggravated alveolar injury and edema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study was the first to explore the changes of iron metabolism indicators in ALI/ARDS of sepsis, clarify the important role of ferroptosis in ALI/ARDS induced by sepsis, and reveal the effects and specific mechanisms of MUC1 in regulating ferroptosis, as well as the sensitization on vitamin E.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel gold-platinum nanoparticles serve as broad-spectrum antioxidants for attenuating ischemia reperfusion injury of the kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35870640/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidney ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a common and inevitable pathological condition in routine urological practices, especially during transplantation. Severe kidney IRI may even induce systemic damage to peripheral organs, and lead to multisystem organ failure. However, no standard clinical treatment option is currently available. It has been reported that kidney IRI is predominantly associated with abnormally increased endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS). Scavenging excessive ROS may reduce the damage caused by oxidative stress and subsequently alleviate kidney IRI. Here, we reported a simple and efficient one-step synthesis of gold-platinum nanoparticles (AuPt NPs) with a gold core having a loose and branched outer platinum shell with superior ROS scavenging capacity to possibly treat kidney IRI. These AuPt NPs exhibited multiple enzyme-like anti-oxidative properties simultaneously possessing catalase- and peroxidase-like activity. These particles showed excellent cell protective capability, and alleviated kidney IRI both in vitro and in vivo without obvious toxicity, by suppressing cell apoptosis, inflammatory cytokine release, and inflammasome formation. Meanwhile, AuPt NPs also had an effect on inhibiting the transition to chronic kidney disease by reducing kidney fibrosis in the long term. Thus, AuPt NPs might be a good therapeutic agent for kidney IRI management and may be helpful for the development of clinical treatments for kidney IRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PLCβ2 Promotes VEGF-Induced Vascular Permeability</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35861069/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35861069/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Regulation of vascular permeability is critical to maintaining tissue metabolic homeostasis. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) is a key stimulus of vascular permeability in acute and chronic diseases including ischemia reperfusion injury, sepsis, and cancer. Identification of novel regulators of vascular permeability would allow for the development of effective targeted therapeutics for patients with unmet medical need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In vitro and in vivo models of VEGFA-induced vascular permeability, pathological permeability, quantitation of intracellular calcium release and cell entry, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels were evaluated with and without modulation of PLC (phospholipase C) β2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Global knock-out of &lt;em&gt;PLCβ2&lt;/em&gt; in mice resulted in blockade of VEGFA-induced vascular permeability in vivo and transendothelial permeability in primary lung endothelial cells. Further work in an immortalized human microvascular cell line modulated with stable knockdown of PLCβ2 recapitulated the observations in the mouse model and primary cell assays. Additionally, loss of PLCβ2 limited both intracellular release and extracellular entry of calcium following VEGF stimulation as well as reduced basal and VEGFA-stimulated levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate compared to control cells. Finally, loss of PLCβ2 in both a hyperoxia-induced lung permeability model and a cardiac ischemia:reperfusion model resulted in improved animal outcomes when compared with wild-type controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The results implicate PLCβ2 as a key positive regulator of VEGF-induced vascular permeability through regulation of both calcium flux and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels at the cellular level. Targeting of PLCβ2 in a therapeutic setting may provide a novel approach to regulating vascular permeability in patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salvianolic Acid A Protects against Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Lung Injury by Inhibiting Neutrophil NETosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35910849/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvianolic acid A (SAA) is one of bioactive polyphenol extracted from a Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), which was widely used to treat cardiovascular disease in traditional Chinese medicine. SAA has been reported to be protective in cardiovascular disease and ischemia injury, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effect, but its role in acute lung injury (ALI) is still unknown. In this study, we sought to investigate the therapeutic effects of SAA in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ALI. The optimal dose of SAA was determined by comparing the attenuation of lung injury score after administration of SAA at three different doses (low, 5 mg/kg; medium, 10 mg/kg; and, high 15 mg/kg). Dexamethasone (DEX) was used as a positive control for SAA. Here, we showed that the therapeutic effect of SAA (10 mg/kg) against LPS-induced pathologic injury in the lungs was comparable to DEX. SAA and DEX attenuated the increased W/D ratio and the protein level, counts of total cells and neutrophils, and cytokine levels in the BALF of ALI mice similarly. The oxidative stress was also relieved by SAA and DEX according to the superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde. NET level in the lungs was elevated in the injured lung while SAA and DEX reduced it significantly. LPS induced phosphorylation of Src, Raf, MEK, and ERK in the lungs, which was inhibited by SAA and DEX. NET level and phosphorylation level of Src/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in the neutrophils from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients were also inhibited by SAA and DEX in vitro, but the YEEI peptide reversed the protective effect of SAA completely. The inhibition of NET release by SAA was also reversed by YEEI peptide in LPS-challenged neutrophils from healthy volunteers. Our data demonstrated that SAA ameliorated ALI via attenuating inflammation, oxidative stress, and neutrophil NETosis. The mechanism of such protective effect might involve the inhibition of Src activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COVID-19 lung disease shares driver AT2 cytopathic features with Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35870428/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In the aftermath of Covid-19, some patients develop a fibrotic lung disease, i.e., post-COVID-19 lung disease (PCLD), for which we currently lack insights into pathogenesis, disease models, or treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Using an AI-guided approach, we analyzed &amp;gt; 1000 human lung transcriptomic datasets associated with various lung conditions using two viral pandemic signatures (ViP and sViP) and one covid lung-derived signature. Upon identifying similarities between COVID-19 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), we subsequently dissected the basis for such similarity from molecular, cytopathic, and immunologic perspectives using a panel of IPF-specific gene signatures, alongside signatures of alveolar type II (AT2) cytopathies and of prognostic monocyte-driven processes that are known drivers of IPF. Transcriptome-derived findings were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to identify the major triggers of AT2 dysfunction. Key findings were validated in hamster and human adult lung organoid (ALO) pre-clinical models of COVID-19 using immunohistochemistry and qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Findings:&lt;/em&gt; COVID-19 resembles IPF at a fundamental level; it recapitulates the gene expression patterns (ViP and IPF signatures), cytokine storm (IL15-centric), and the AT2 cytopathic changes, e.g., injury, DNA damage, arrest in a transient, damage-induced progenitor state, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These immunocytopathic features were induced in pre-clinical COVID models (ALO and hamster) and reversed with effective anti-CoV-2 therapeutics in hamsters. PPI-network analyses pinpointed ER stress as one of the shared early triggers of both diseases, and IHC studies validated the same in the lungs of deceased subjects with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamster lungs. Lungs from tg-mice, in which ER stress is induced specifically in the AT2 cells, faithfully recapitulate the host immune response and alveolar cytopathic changes that are induced by SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/em&gt; Like IPF, COVID-19 may be driven by injury-induced ER stress that culminates into progenitor state arrest and SASP in AT2 cells. The ViP signatures in monocytes may be key determinants of prognosis. The insights, signatures, disease models identified here are likely to spur the development of therapies for patients with IPF and other fibrotic interstitial lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhaled Pro-Efferocytic Nanozymes Promote Resolution of Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35859230/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a significant contributor to the morbidity and mortality of sepsis. Characterized by uncontrolled inflammation and excessive inflammatory cells infiltration in lung, ALI has been exacerbated by impaired efferocytosis (clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages). Through specific receptor recognition and activation of downstream signaling, efferocytic macrophages promote resolution of inflammation by efficiently engulfing dying cells, avoiding the consequent release of cellular inflammatory contents. Here, inspired by the intrinsic recovery mechanism of efferocytosis, an apoptotic cell membrane (ACM) coated antioxidant nanozyme (AOzyme) is engineered, thus obtaining an inhalable pro-efferocytic nanozyme (AOzyme@ACM). Notably, AOzyme@ACM can efficiently increase apoptotic cell removal by combing enhanced macrophages recognition of &amp;ldquo;eat me&amp;rdquo; signals through apoptotic body mimicking and scavenge of intracellular excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), a significant barrier for efferocytosis. AOzyme@ACM can significantly inhibit inflammatory response, promote pro-resolving (M2) phenotype transition of macrophage, and alleviate ALI in endotoxemia mice compared with AOzyme group. By addressing the critical factor in the pathogenesis of sepsis-related ALI through restoring efferocytosis activity, the ACM-based antioxidant nanozyme in this study is envisioned to provide a promising strategy to treat this complex and challenging disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interleukin-6-dependent epithelial fluidization initiates fibrotic lung remodeling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35857823/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic disease results from the failure of tissues to maintain homeostasis. In the lung, coordinated repair of the epithelium is essential for preserving homeostasis. In animal models and human lung disease, airway epithelial cells mobilize in response to lung injury, resulting in the formation of airway-like cysts with persistent loss of functional cell types and parenchymal architecture. Using live-cell imaging of human lung epithelial cultures and mouse precision-cut lung slices, we demonstrated that distal airway epithelia are aberrantly fluidized both after injury and in fibrotic lung disease. Through transcriptomic profiling and pharmacologic stimulation of epithelial cultures, we identified interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling as a driver of tissue fluidization. This signaling cascade occurred independently of canonical Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling but instead was dependent on a downstream SRC family kinase (SFK)-yes-associated protein (YAP) axis. Airway epithelial-fibroblast cocultures revealed that the fibrotic mesenchyme acts as a source of IL-6 family cytokines, which drive airway fluidization. Inhibition of the IL-6-SFK-YAP cascade was sufficient to prevent fluidization in both in vitro and ex vivo models. Last, we demonstrated a reduction in fibrotic lung remodeling in mice through genetic or pharmacologic targeting of IL-6-related signaling. Together, our findings illustrate the critical role of airway epithelial fluidization in coordinating the balance between homeostatic lung repair and fibrotic airspace remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anti-inflammatory protective effect of ADAMTS-13 in murine arthritis models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35875933/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have frequent thrombotic events with endothelial dysfunction. Von Willebrand factor (VWF) has been shown to bind neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and NETs are part of RA etiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; This study aims to elucidate whether this prothrombotic status exacerbates inflammation in arthritis. Here we focus on the involvement of A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13), an enzyme cleaving VWF and its effect on NET deposition and RA development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We evaluated the influence of the Adamts13 gene and recombinant human ADAMTS-13 (rhADAMTS-13) on arthritis in the mouse models of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We also assessed VWF and NETs in synovial tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Several &lt;em&gt;Adamts13&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice developed arthritis, while &lt;em&gt;Adamts13&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; siblings did not. Synovial tissue from &lt;em&gt;Adamts13&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; showed accumulation of NETs. Treatment of DBA/1 J mice, an arthritis-susceptible strain, with well-tolerated doses of rhADAMT13 reduced arthritis incidence and alleviated the severity of arthritis. Mice treated with rhADAMT13 presented less serum interleukin 6 and less bone erosion determined by micro-computed tomography. The effects on arthritis severity were observed both when administering rhADAMTS-13 prophylactically and also when given after arthritis has developed. In both conditions, rhADAMTS-13 reduced VWF and NET deposition on proliferated synovial tissue evaluated by immunoblotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results demonstrate the inhibitory role of &lt;em&gt;Adamts13&lt;/em&gt; in murine arthritis and the effectiveness of rhADAMTS-13 treatment. Additionally, this study suggests that deposition of VWF in the synovium and subsequent pathogenic NET retention promotes arthritis. Treatment with rhADAMTS-13 provides a potential therapeutic approach targeting inflammation and pro-thrombotic state in arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating extracellular histones exacerbate acute lung injury by augmenting pulmonary endothelial dysfunction via TLR4-dependent mechanism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35852995/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular histones released into the circulation following trauma, sepsis, and ARDS may act as potent damage-associated molecular pattern signals leading to multiple organ failure. Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction caused by extracellular histones has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo; however, precise mechanistic details of histone-induced EC dysfunction and exacerbation of ongoing inflammation remain poorly understood. This study investigated the role of extracellular histones in exacerbating preexisting endothelial dysfunction and acute lung injury. Histone subunits H3 and H4, but not H1, H2A, or H2B, induced permeability in human pulmonary EC. H3 and H4 at concentrations above 30 µg/mL caused EC inflammation reflected by activation of the NF-κB pathway, transcriptional activation, and release of cytokines and chemokines including IL-6 and IL-8, and increased mRNA and protein expression of EC adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Pharmacological inhibitors targeting Toll-like receptor TLR4 but not TLR2/6, blocked histone-induced EC dysfunction. H3 and H4 also strongly augmented EC permeability and inflammation caused by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial particles, endotoxin, and TNFα. Heparin blocked histone-induced augmentation of EC inflammation caused by endotoxin and TNFα. Injection of histone in mouse models of lung injury caused by bacterial wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (HKSA) augmented ALI parameters: increased protein content, cell count, and inflammatory cytokine secretion in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Important clinical significance of these findings is in the demonstration that even a modest increase in extracellular histone levels can act as a severe exacerbating factor in conjunction with other EC barrier disruptive or proinflammatory agents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MgIG exerts therapeutic effects on crizotinib-induced hepatotoxicity by limiting ROS-mediated autophagy and pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35855570/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crizotinib (CRIZO) has been widely employed to treat non-small-cell lung cancer. However, hepatic inflammatory injury is the major toxicity of CRIZO, which limits its clinical application, and the underlying mechanism of CRIZO-induced hepatotoxicity has not been fully explored. Herein, we used cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry to detect CRIZO-induced cytotoxicity on human hepatocytes (HL-7702). CRIZO significantly reduced the survival rate of hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay kit showed that CRIZO treatment strongly increased the level of ROS. In addition, CRIZO treatment caused the appearance of balloon-like bubbles and autophagosomes in HL-7702 cells. Subsequently, Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA assays revealed that ROS-mediated pyroptosis and autophagy contributed to CRIZO-induced hepatic injury. Based on the role of ROS in CRIZO-induced hepatotoxicity, magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) was used as an intervention drug. MgIG activated the Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway and reduced ROS level. Additionally, MgIG suppressed hepatic inflammation by inhibiting NF-κB activity, thereby reducing CRIZO-induced hepatotoxicity. In conclusion, CRIZO promoted autophagy activation and pyroptosis via the accumulation of ROS in HL-7702 cells. MgIG exerts therapeutic effects on CRIZO-induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing the level of ROS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ZNF354C Mediated by DNMT1 Ameliorates Lung Ischemia-Reperfusion Oxidative Stress Injury by Reducing TFPI Promoter Methylation to Upregulate TFPI</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35915612/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pulmonary ischemia reperfusion- (I/R-) induced dysfunction is a significant clinical problem after lung transplantation. In this study, we aim to explore the molecular mechanism of lung I/R injury (LIRI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Bioinformatic analysis of gene involved in oxidative stress. A HUVEC oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model and I/R mouse model were first established via I/R. The cellular proliferation, migration, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and parameters of lung injury were assessed via CCK-8, EdU staining, Transwell, cellular ROS kit, and H&amp;amp;E staining. We also confirmed related gene expressions and protein levels and the interaction between the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) promotor and ZNF354C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Bioinformatic analysis results showed TFPI contributed to oxidative stress. OGD/R caused a reduction in cell viability and migration, hypermethylation of TFPI, increased ROS, and downregulation of ZNF354C, TFPI, and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in HUVECs. Besides, ZNF354C could directly bind to the TFPI promoter, enhance proliferation and migration, and inhibit ROS in OGD/R-induced HUVECs by upregulating TFPI. More importantly, we discovered that 5-Aza could reduce TFPI methylation, upregulate TFPI, and enhance the binding of ZNF354C to the TFPI promoter in LIRI. Furthermore, DNMT1 silencing could induce proliferation and migration and prevent ROS in OGD/R-induced HUVECs by upregulating ZNF354C. Additionally, we verified that ZNF354C could alleviate LIRI by preventing DNA methylation &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; ZNF354C overexpression induced proliferation and migration, as well as suppressed ROS in OGD/R-induced HUVECs, and alleviated LIRI in mice by inhibiting TFPI promoter methylation to upregulate TFPI. Therefore, ZNF354C and TFPI methylation might be promising molecular markers for LIRI therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antifibrotic effect of AD-1 on lipopolysaccharide-mediated fibroblast injury in L929 cells and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35735105/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20(&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;)-25-methoxyl-dammarane-3β,12β,20-triol (25-OCH3-PPD, AD-1) is a dammarane ginsenoside that is isolated from Panax notoginseng. The present study aimed to explore its anti-pulmonary fibrosis (PF) effect &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. L929 cells were treated with 10 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish a PF model &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and mice were administered with 3.5 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; bleomycin (BLM) by endotracheal intubation to establish a PF model &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; for investigating the anti-PF effect and its potential mechanism. The results demonstrated that AD-1 reduced the injury, extracellular matrix (ECM) buildup and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) protein expression levels of L929 induced by LPS. Oral administration of AD-1 downregulated the expression of interleukins (such as IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-18), increased the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH), reduced the lung coefficient and the content of hydroxyproline (HYP), and mediated the Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio and P-p53, β-catenin and SIRT3 expression in the lung tissue of mice. Furthermore, AD-1 inhibited the expression levels of TGF-β1, TIMP-1 and α-SMA and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition in the lung tissue of PF mice. These results indicated that AD-1 could alleviate PF both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, and the underlying mechanism may be related to the decrease in ECM deposition and inflammation, the enhancement of antioxidant capacity, and the mediation of lung cell apoptosis and the TGF-β1/TIMP-1/α-SMA signaling pathway, which provide a theoretical basis for the rehabilitation treatment of PF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autophagy promotes GSDME-mediated pyroptosis via intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in cobalt chloride-induced hypoxia reoxygenation-acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35863214/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cobalt ions induced more serious damage in the reoxygenation stage in HRI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induced GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in the HRI-AKI model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-activated GSDME was cleaved via the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in HRI-AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-elevated autophagy promoted the induction of apoptosis and GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in HRI-AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt is a transition element that abundantly exists in the environment. Besides direct hypoxia stress, cobalt ions indirectly induce hypoxia-reoxygenation injury (HRI), the main cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), a life-threatening clinical syndrome characterized by the necrosis of the proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) and inflammation. Pyroptosis, a type of inflammatory programmed cell death, might play an essential role in HRI-AKI. However, whether pyroptosis is involved in cobalt chloride (CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-induced HRI-AKI remains unknown. Autophagy is a cellular biological process maintaining cell homeostasis that is involved in cell damage in AKI, yet the underlying regulatory mechanism of autophagy on pyroptosis has not been fully understood. In this study, the in vitro and in vivo models of CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced HRI-AKI were established with HK-2 cell line and C57BL/6J mouse. Pyroptosis-related markers were detected with western blotting and immunofluorescence assays, and results showed that gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis was involved in the cell damage in HRI-AKI. Specific chemical inhibitors of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 significantly inhibited GSDME-mediated pyroptosis, verifying that GSDME-mediated pyroptosis was induced via the activation of caspase 3/8/9. The western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were adopted to detect the accumulation of the autophagosomes, and results suggested that HRI increased the autophagic level. The effects of autophagy on apoptosis and pyroptosis were evaluated using lentivirus transfection assays to knock down autophagy-specific genes atg5 and fip200, and results demonstrated that autophagy induced GSDME-mediated pyroptosis via apoptotic pathways in HRI-AKI. Our results revealed the involvement of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced HRI-AKI and promoted the understanding of the regulatory mechanism of GSDME cleavage. Our study might provide a potential therapeutic target for HRI-AKI, and will be helpful for the risk evaluation of cobalt exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ceria nanoparticles prophylactic used for renal ischemia-reperfusion injury treatment by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammatory response</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35926357/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury (RIRI) is the leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), a common disease with high morbidity and mortality. However, due to the lack of effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools, patients have to resort to conservative treatment. To address this issue, we have developed a novel prophylactic strategy that involves the pre-treatment use of ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) before surgery. Based on our careful study of the three different sizes of CNPs that we synthesized, 46 nm (NP46), 81 nm (NP81), and 118 nm (NP118), we have found that NP118 can be used as effective prophylactic agents against RIRI and subsequent renal fibrosis. In our experiments, the CNPs exhibited excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro and effectively protected the kidney against RIRI and renal fibrosis in vivo, as proved by the decreases in renal lesions, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, apoptotic cell, KIM-1 expression, and fibrotic area in CNPs treated samples relative to RIRI group. Mechanistically, not only did the CNPs reduce oxidative stress by regulating the Nrf2 pathway, but they also attenuated RIRI induced inflammatory response by decreasing macrophage infiltration and polarization to M1 phenotype, and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. In vitro results further confirmed that CNPs pre-treatment not only dramatically decreased intracellular ROS production in renal tubular epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells, but also effectively attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells. In addition, we found that one fourth of the NP118 persisted for more than 21 days in IR kidneys, and that out of the three sizes of CNPs, NP118 achieved the best results in all our experiments. Our study provides new insights into the usage and majorization of CNPs as a potential therapy to treat or prevent RIRI and renal fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging roles of extracellular vesicle-associated non-coding RNAs in hypoxia: Insights from cancer, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35966580/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia is a central pathophysiological component in cancer, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, which represent the most common medical conditions resulting in long-term disability and death. Recent evidence suggests common signaling pathways in these diverse settings mediated by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are packaged in extracellular vesicles (EVs) protecting ncRNAs from degradation. EVs are a heterogeneous group of lipid bilayer-covered vesicles released from virtually all cells, which have important roles in intercellular communication. Recent studies pointed out that ncRNAs including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are selectively sorted into EVs, modulating specific aspects of cancer development, namely cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, immune tolerance or drug resistance, under conditions of hypoxia in recipient cells. In myocardial infarction and stroke, ncRNAs shuttled via EVs have been shown to control tissue survival and remodeling post-hypoxia by regulating cell injury, inflammatory responses, angiogenesis, neurogenesis or neuronal plasticity. This review discusses recent evidence on EV-associated ncRNAs in hypoxic cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke, discussing their cellular origin, biological function and disease significance. The emerging concept of lncRNA-circular RNA/ miRNA/ mRNA networks is outlined, upon which ncRNAs synergistically respond to hypoxia in order to modify disease responses. Particular notion is given to ncRNAs participating in at least two of the three conditions, which revealed a large degree of overlaps across pathophysiological conditions. Possible roles of EV-ncRNAs as therapeutic products or theranostic markers are defined.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of Immuno-Inflammatory Signals in Liver Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35883665/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major obstacle in liver resection and liver transplantation. The initial step of IRI is mediated through ischemia which promotes the production of reactive oxygen species in Kupffer cells. This furthermore promotes the activation of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, interferon, inducible nitric oxide synthase, TLR9/nuclear-factor kappa B pathway, and the production of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as ATP, histone, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), urate, mitochondrial formyl peptides and S100 proteins. With ongoing cell death of hepatocytes during the ischemic phase, DAMPs are built up and released into the circulation upon reperfusion. This promotes a cytokines/chemokine storm that attracts neutrophils and other immune cells to the site of tissue injury. The effect of IRI is further aggravated by the release of cytokines and chemokines, such as epithelial neutrophil activating protein (CXCL5), KC (CXCL1) and MIP-2 (CXCL2), the complement proteins C3a and C5a, mitochondrial-derived formyl peptides, leukotriene B4 and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) from migrating neutrophils. These NETs can also activate platelets and form Neutrophil-platelet microthrombi to further worsen ischemia in the liver. In this review we aim to summarize the current knowledge of mediators that promote liver IRI, and we will discuss the role of neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps in mediating IRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils, known as an important part of the immune system, are the most abundant leukocyte population in peripheral blood, but excessive recruitment will lead to tissue/organ injury. RNA sequencing showed that ionizing radiation significantly increased the expression of characteristic genes of neutrophils in intestinal tissues compared with liver and lung tissues. By clearing neutrophils with an anti-Ly6G antibody, we found that neutrophil infiltration is critical for irradiation-induced intestinal injury. CXCR2 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that mediates the migration of neutrophils by combining with its ligands. Compared with observations in liver and lung tissues, we found that CXCR2 and its ligands, including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL5, were all significantly upregulated in irradiated intestinal tissues. Further studies showed that SB225002, an inhibitor of CXCR2, could effectively inhibit the chemotaxis of neutrophils and tissue damage mediated by the CXCL-CXCR2 signalling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plk2-mediated phosphorylation and translocalization of Nrf2 activates anti-inflammation through p53/Plk2/p21cip1 signaling in acute kidney injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plk2 is a cellular stress-responsive factor that is induced in response to oxidative stress. However, the roles of Plk2 in acute kidney injury (AKI) have not been clarified. We previously found that Plk2 is an interacting factor of Nrf2 in response to cellular stress, since Plk2 is upregulated in the Nrf2-dependent network. Here, we show that the levels of p53, Plk2, p21&lt;sup&gt;cip1&lt;/sup&gt;, and chromatin-bound Nrf2 were all upregulated in kidney tissues of mice or NRK52E cells treated with either cisplatin or methotrexate. Upregulation of Plk2 by p53 led to an increase of Nrf2 in both soluble and chromatin fractions in cisplatin-treated NRK52E cells. Consistently, depletion of Plk2 suppressed the levels of Nrf2. Of note, Plk2 directly phosphorylated Nrf2 at Ser40, which facilitated its interaction with p21&lt;sup&gt;cip1&lt;/sup&gt; and translocation into the nuclei for the activation of anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory factors in response to AKI. Together, these findings suggest that Plk2 may serve as an anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory regulator through the phosphorylation and activation of Nrf2 to protect kidney cells from kidney toxicants and that Plk2 and Nrf2 therefore work cooperatively for the protection and survival of kidney cells from harmful stresses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wildfires and extracellular vesicles: Exosomal MicroRNAs as mediators of cross-tissue cardiopulmonary responses to biomass smoke</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35863239/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35863239/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple wildfire-relevant exposure conditions were tested in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were evaluated in circulating plasma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposures altered EV-encapsulated microRNAs involved in cell stress and hypoxia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposures disrupted cell stress and hypoxia pathways in lung and heart tissues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced responses occurred from flaming vs. smoldering burn conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Wildfires are a threat to public health world-wide that are growing in intensity and prevalence. The biological mechanisms that elicit wildfire-associated toxicity remain largely unknown. The potential involvement of cross-tissue communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a new mechanism that has yet to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Female CD-1 mice were exposed to smoke condensate samples collected from the following biomass burn scenarios: flaming peat; smoldering peat; flaming red oak; and smoldering red oak, representing lab-based simulations of wildfire scenarios. Lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples, peripheral blood, and heart tissues were collected 4 and 24 h post-exposure. Exosome-enriched EVs were isolated from plasma, physically characterized, and profiled for microRNA (miRNA) expression. Pathway-level responses in the lung and heart were evaluated through RNA sequencing and pathway analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Markers of cardiopulmonary tissue injury and inflammation from BALF samples were significantly altered in response to exposures, with the greatest changes occurring from flaming biomass conditions. Plasma EV miRNAs relevant to cardiovascular disease showed exposure-induced expression alterations, including miR-150, miR-183, miR-223-3p, miR-30b, and miR-378a. Lung and heart mRNAs were identified with differential expression enriched for hypoxia and cell stress-related pathways. Flaming red oak exposure induced the greatest transcriptional response in the heart, a large portion of which were predicted as regulated by plasma EV miRNAs, including miRNAs known to regulate hypoxia-induced cardiovascular injury. Many of these miRNAs had published evidence supporting their transfer across tissues. A follow-up analysis of miR-30b showed that it was increased in expression in the heart of exposed mice in the absence of changes to its precursor molecular, pri-miR-30b, suggesting potential transfer from external sources (e.g., plasma).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt; This study posits a potential mechanism through which wildfire exposures induce cardiopulmonary responses, highlighting the role of circulating plasma EVs in intercellular and systems-level communication between tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>14-3-3ζ inhibits maladaptive repair in renal tubules by regulating YAP and reduces renal interstitial fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35840657/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) refers to a group of common clinical syndromes characterized by acute renal dysfunction, which may lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), and this process is called the AKI-CKD transition. The transcriptional coactivator YAP can promote the AKI-CKD transition by regulating the expression of profibrotic factors, and 14-3-3 protein zeta (14-3-3ζ), an important regulatory protein of YAP, may prevent the AKI-CKD transition. We established an AKI-CKD model in mice by unilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and overexpressed 14-3-3ζ in mice using a fluid dynamics-based gene transfection technique. We also overexpressed and knocked down 14-3-3ζ in vitro. In AKI-CKD model mice, 14-3-3ζ expression was significantly increased at the AKI stage. During the development of chronic disease, the expression of 14-3-3ζ tended to decrease, whereas active YAP was consistently overexpressed. In vitro, we found that 14-3-3ζ can combine with YAP, promote the phosphorylation of YAP, inhibit YAP nuclear translocation, and reduce the expression of fibrosis-related proteins. In an in vivo intervention experiment, we found that the overexpression of 14-3-3ζ slowed the process of renal fibrosis in a mouse model of AKI-CKD. These findings suggest that 14-3-3ζ can affect the expression of fibrosis-related proteins by regulating YAP, inhibit the maladaptive repair of renal tubular epithelial cells, and prevent the AKI-CKD transition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomal lncRNA TUG1 derived from human urine-derived stem cells attenuates renal ischemia/reperfusion injury by interacting with SRSF1 to regulate ASCL4-mediated ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35841017/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LncRNA TUG1 carried by USC-Exo regulates cell ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LncRNA TUG1 regulates the stability of ACSL4 mRNA by interacting with SRSF1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LncRNA TUG1 alleviates IRI-induced AKI by suppressing ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Human urine-derived stem cells (USCs)-derived exosomes (USC-Exo) could improve kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), while the underlying mechanisms of this protective effect remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Human USCs and USC-Exo were isolated and verified by morphology and specific biomarkers. The effects of USC-Exo on ferroptosis and kidney injury were detected in the IRI-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) model in C57BL/6 mice. The effects of USC-Exo on ferroptosis and lncRNA taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) were detected in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-treated human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2). The interaction of SRSF1 and TUG1, ACSL4 was checked via RNA pull-down/RIP and RNA stability assays. The effects of LncRNA TUG1 on SRSF1/ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis were verified in H/R-treated HK-2 cells and the IRI-induced AKI mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; USC-Exo treatment improved kidney injury and ameliorated ferroptosis in IRI-induced AKI mouse models. USC-Exo were rich in lncRNA TUG1, which suppressed ferroptosis in HK-2 cells exposed to H/R. Mechanistically, lncRNA TUG1 regulates the stability of ACSL4 mRNA by interacting with RNA-binding protein SRSF1. In addition, SRSF1 upregulation or ACSL4 downregulation partially reversed the protective effect of lncRNA TUG1 on ferroptosis in H/R-treated HK-2 cells. Further, ACSL4 upregulation partially reversed TUG1&amp;rsquo;s repression on kidney injury and ferroptosis in IRI-induced AKI mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, lncRNA TUG1 carried by USC-Exo regulated ASCL4-mediated ferroptosis by interacting with SRSF1 and then protected IRI-induced AKI. Potentially, USC-Exo rich in lncRNA TUG1 can serve as a promising therapeutic method for IRI-AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the JAK/STAT Pathway with Baricitinib Reduces the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Caused by Hemorrhagic Shock in Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35837955/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35837955/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; The aim of this study was to investigate (a) the effects of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway inhibitor (baricitinib) on the MODS in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock (HS) and (b) whether treatment with baricitinib attenuates the activation of JAK/STAT, NF-κB and NLRP3 caused by HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Post-traumatic MODS, which is in part due to excessive systemic inflammation, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The JAK/STAT pathway is a regulator of numerous growth factor and cytokine receptors and, hence, is considered a potential master regulator of many inflammatory signaling processes. However, its role in trauma-hemorrhage is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; An acute HS rat model was performed to determine the effect of baricitinib on MODS. The activation of JAK/STAT, NF-κB and NLRP3 pathways were analyzed by western blotting in the kidney and liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrate here for the first time that treatment with baricitinib (during resuscitation following severe hemorrhage) attenuates the organ injury and dysfunction and the activation of JAK/STAT, NF-κB and NLRP3 pathways caused by HS in the rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results point to a role of the JAK/STAT pathway in the pathophysiology of the organ injury and dysfunction caused by trauma/hemorrhage and indicate that JAK inhibitors, such as baricitinib, may be repurposed for the treatment of the MODS after trauma and/or hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TRAIL protects the immature lung from hyperoxic injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35840556/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hyperoxia-induced pro-inflammatory response and tissue damage constitute pivotal steps leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the immature lung. The pro-inflammatory cytokines are considered attractive candidates for a directed intervention but the complex interplay between inflammatory and developmental signaling pathways requires a comprehensive evaluation before introduction into clinical trials as studied here for the death inducing ligand TRAIL. At birth and during prolonged exposure to oxygen and mechanical ventilation, levels of TRAIL were lower in tracheal aspirates of preterm infants &amp;lt;29 weeks of gestation which developed moderate/severe BPD. These findings were reproduced in the newborn mouse model of hyperoxic injury. The loss of TRAIL was associated with increased inflammation, apoptosis induction and more pronounced lung structural simplification after hyperoxia exposure for 7 days while activation of NFκB signaling during exposure to hyperoxia was abrogated. Pretreatment with recombinant TRAIL rescued the developmental distortions in precision cut lung slices of both wildtype and TRAIL-/- mice exposed to hyperoxia. Of importance, TRAIL preserved alveolar type II cells, mesenchymal progenitor cells and vascular endothelial cells. In the situation of TRAIL depletion, our data ascribe oxygen toxicity a more injurious impact on structural lung development. These data are not surprising taking into account the diverse functions of TRAIL and its stimulatory effects on NFκB signaling as central driver of survival and development. TRAIL exerts a protective role in the immature lung as observed for the death inducing ligand TNF-α before.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Combustion-Derived Particulate PAHs Associated with Small Airway Dysfunction in Elderly Patients with COPD</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35834827/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence of the respiratory effects of ambient organic aerosols (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) among patients with chronic diseases is limited. We aimed to assess whether exposure to ambient particle-bound PAHs could worsen small airway functions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Forty-five COPD patients were recruited with four repeated visits in 2014-2015 in Beijing, China. Parameters of pulmonary function and pulmonary/systemic inflammation and oxidative stress were measured at each visit. Linear mixed-effect models were performed to evaluate the associations between PAHs and measurements. In this study, participants experienced an average PAH level of 61.7 ng/m3. Interquartile range increases in exposure to particulate PAHs at prior up to 7 days were associated with reduced small airway functions, namely, decreases of 17.7-35.5% in forced maximal mid-expiratory flow. Higher levels of particulate PAHs were also associated with heightened lung injury and inflammation and oxidative stress. Stronger overall effects were found for PAHs from traffic emissions and coal burning. Exposure to ambient particulate PAHs was capable of impairing small airway functions in elderly patients with COPD, potentially via inflammation and oxidative stress. These findings highlight the importance of control efforts on organic particulate matter from fossil fuel combustion emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histone demethylase JMJD3 downregulation protects against aberrant force-induced osteoarthritis through epigenetic control of NR4A1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35831280/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent joint disease with no effective treatment strategies. Aberrant mechanical stimuli was demonstrated to be an essential factor for OA pathogenesis. Although multiple studies have detected potential regulatory mechanisms underlying OA and have concentrated on developing novel treatment strategies, the epigenetic control of OA remains unclear. Histone demethylase JMJD3 has been reported to mediate multiple physiological and pathological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, autophagy, and apoptosis. However, the regulation of JMJD3 in aberrant force-related OA and its mediatory effect on disease progression are still unknown. In this work, we confirmed the upregulation of JMJD3 in aberrant force-induced cartilage injury in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, inhibition of JMJD3 by its inhibitor, GSK-J4, or downregulation of JMJD3 by adenovirus infection of sh-JMJD3 could alleviate the aberrant force-induced chondrocyte injury. Mechanistic investigation illustrated that aberrant force induces JMJD3 expression and then demethylates H3K27me3 at the NR4A1 promoter to promote its expression. Further experiments indicated that NR4A1 can regulate chondrocyte apoptosis, cartilage degeneration, extracellular matrix degradation, and inflammatory responses. In vivo, anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) was performed to construct an OA model, and the therapeutic effect of GSK-J4 was validated. More importantly, we adopted a peptide-siRNA nanoplatform to deliver si-JMJD3 into articular cartilage, and the severity of joint degeneration was remarkably mitigated. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that JMJD3 is flow-responsive and epigenetically regulates OA progression. Our work provides evidences for JMJD3 inhibition as an innovative epigenetic therapy approach for joint diseases by utilizing p5RHH-siRNA nanocomplexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;E-Cigarette (e-cig) Vaping-Associated Acute Lung Injury&amp;rdquo; (EVALI) has been linked to vitamin-E-acetate (VEA) and Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), due to their presence in patients&amp;rsquo; e-cigs and biological samples. Lacking standardized methodologies for patients&amp;rsquo; data collection and comprehensive physicochemical/toxicological studies using real-world-vapor exposures, very little data are available, thus the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of EVALI is still unknown. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical appraisal of existing literature on clinical/epidemiological features and physicochemical-toxicological characterization of vaping emissions associated with EVALI. The literature review of 161 medical case reports revealed that the predominant demographic pattern was healthy white male, adolescent, or young adult, vaping illicit/informal THC-containing e-cigs. The main histopathologic pattern consisted of diffuse alveolar damage with bilateral ground-glass-opacities at chest radiograph/CT, and increased number of macrophages or neutrophils and foamy-macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage. The chemical analysis of THC/VEA e-cig vapors showed a chemical difference between THC/VEA and the single THC or VEA. The chemical characterization of vapors from counterfeit THC-based e-cigs or in-house-prepared e-liquids using either cannabidiol (CBD), VEA, or medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), identified many toxicants, such as carbonyls, volatile organic compounds, terpenes, silicon compounds, hydrocarbons, heavy metals, pesticides and various industrial/manufacturing/automotive-related chemicals. There is very scarce published toxicological data on emissions from THC/VEA e-liquids. However, CBD, MCT, and VEA emissions exert varying degrees of cytotoxicity, inflammation, and lung damage, depending on puffing topography and cell line. Major knowledge gaps were identified, including the need for more systematic-standardized epidemiological surveys, comprehensive physicochemical characterization of real-world e-cig emissions, and mechanistic studies linking emission properties to specific toxicological outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intermediary Role of Lung Alveolar Type 1 Cells in Epithelial Repair upon Sendai Virus Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35679221/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lung epithelium forms the first barrier against respiratory pathogens and noxious chemicals; however, little is known about how more than 90% of this barrier, made of AT1 (alveolar type 1) cells, responds to injury. Using the Sendai virus to model natural infection in mice, we find evidence that AT1 cells have an intermediary role by persisting in areas depleted of AT2 cells, upregulating IFN responsive genes, and receding from invading airway cells. Sendai virus infection mobilizes airway cells to form alveolar SOX2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Sry-box 2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) clusters without differentiating into AT1 or AT2 cells. Large AT2 cell-depleted areas remain covered by AT1 cells, which we name &amp;ldquo;AT2-less regions&amp;rdquo;, and are replaced by SOX2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clusters spreading both basally and luminally. AT2 cell proliferation and differentiation are largely confined to topologically distal regions and form &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; alveolar surface, with limited contribution to &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; repairs of AT2-less regions. Time-course single-cell RNA sequencing profiling and RNAscope validation suggest enhanced immune responses and altered growth signals in AT1 cells. Our comprehensive spatiotemporal and genomewide study highlights the hitherto unappreciated role of AT1 cells in lung injury-repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective role of tissue-resident Tregs in a murine model of beryllium-induced disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35819849/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD4+ T cells drive the immunopathogenesis of chronic beryllium disease (CBD), and their recruitment to the lung heralds the onset of granulomatous inflammation. We have shown that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Tregs control granuloma formation in an HLA-DP2 Tg model of CBD. In these mice, beryllium oxide (BeO) exposure resulted in the accumulation of 3 distinct CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell subsets in the lung, with the majority of tissue-resident memory cells expressing FoxP3. The amount of Be regulated the number of total and antigen-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and Tregs in the lungs of HLA-DP2 Tg mice. Depletion of Tregs increased the number of IFN-γ-producing CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and enhanced lung injury, while mice treated with IL-2/αIL-2 complexes had increased Tregs and reduced inflammation and Be-responsive T cells in the lung. BeO-experienced resident Tregs suppressed anti-CD3-induced proliferation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in a contact-dependent manner. CTLA-4 and ICOS blockade, as well as the addition of LPS to BeO-exposed mice, increased the effector T cell (Teff)/Treg ratio and enhanced lung injury. Collectively, these data show that the protective role of tissue-resident Tregs is dependent on quantity of Be exposure and is overcome by blocking immune regulatory molecules or additional environmental insults.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Locus on Chromosome 15 Contributes to Acute Ozone-induced Lung Injury in Collaborative Cross Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35816602/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-induced respiratory toxicity varies considerably within the human population and across inbred mouse strains, indicative of gene-environment interactions (GxE). Though previous studies have identified several quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes underlying responses to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, precise mechanisms of susceptibility remain incompletely described. We sought to update our understanding of the genetic architecture of O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; responsiveness using the Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred mouse panel. We evaluated hallmark O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced inflammation and injury phenotypes in 56 CC strains after exposure to filtered air or 2 ppm O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and performed focused genetic analysis of variation in lung injury, as reflected by protein in lung lavage fluid. Strain-dependent responses to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were clear, and QTL mapping revealed two novel loci on Chr (Chromosomes) 10 (peak, 26.2 Mb; 80% confidence interval [CI], 24.6-43.6 Mb) and 15 (peak, 47.1 Mb; 80% CI, 40.2-54.9 Mb), the latter surpassing the 95% significance threshold. At the Chr 15 locus, C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ founder haplotypes were associated with higher lung injury responses compared with all other CC founder haplotypes. With further statistical analysis and a weight of evidence approach, we delimited the Chr 15 QTL to an ∼2 Mb region containing 21 genes (10 protein coding) and nominated three candidate genes, namely &lt;em&gt;Oxr1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rspo2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Angpt1&lt;/em&gt;. Gene and protein expression data further supported &lt;em&gt;Oxr1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Angpt1&lt;/em&gt; as priority candidate genes. In summary, we have shown that O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury is modulated by genetic variation, identified two high priority candidate genes, and demonstrated the value of the CC for detecting GxE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) induces lung injury and fibrosis through neutrophil extracellular traps</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35835272/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) is an extensively used plasticizer that has aroused widespread concern about its potential toxicity. Previous evidences demonstrate that BBP exposure is associated with asthma and impaired lung function. Accumulating data indicates that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a particular manner of neutrophil death, play a vital role in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases. However, the immunotoxicity effects of BBP in lung injury are unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the potential impacts of BBP-induced NETs on lung injury and fibrosis. Mice treated with BBP exhibited significant lung injury, with alveolar hemorrhage, lung edema and increased neutrophil infiltration. Meanwhile, BBP promoted extensive neutrophil infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and NETs deposition in lung tissues. Moreover, BBP clearly triggered NETs formation in vitro, which was confirmed by net-like structures decorated with myeloperoxidase and citrullinated histone H3. Furthermore, BBP fueled glucose uptake and ROS burst of neutrophils playing essential roles during NETs formation. Additionally, we proved that NETs could promote fibrogenesis in murine lung epithelial cells and observed lung fibrosis remarkably after BBP-induced injury. Taken together, our findings indicated that exposure to BBP could increase the risk for lung injury and fibrosis by disturbing innate immunity via NETs formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histones of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Induce CD11b Expression in Brain Pericytes Via Dectin-1 after Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35819574/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain pericyte is a unique and indispensable part of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and contributes to several pathological processes in traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which pericytes are regulated in the damaged brain are largely unknown. Here, we show that the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) induces the appearance of CD11b+ pericytes after TBI. These CD11b+ pericyte subsets are characterized by increased permeability and pro-inflammatory profiles compared to CD11b- pericytes. Moreover, histones from NETs by Dectin-1 facilitate CD11b induction in brain pericytes in PKC-c-Jun dependent manner, resulting in neuroinflammation and BBB dysfunction after TBI. These data indicate that neutrophil-NET-pericyte and histone-Dectin-1-CD11b are possible mechanisms for the activation and dysfunction of pericytes. Targeting NETs formation and Dectin-1 are promising means of treating TBI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-17A aggravates asthma-induced intestinal immune injury by promoting neutrophil trafficking</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35815539/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the concept of the gut-lung axis reinforced in recent years, emerging evidence has shown that intestinal homeostasis is vital for lung health. Nevertheless, the impacts of lung homeostasis on intestinal tracts and their mechanism are rarely studied. Our results showed that papain-induced asthmatic mice exhibited apparent colonic injuries compared with controls, including increased intestinal permeability, neutrophil and Th17 infiltration in the colonic lamina propria. Moreover, the intranasal administration of papain aggravated such colonic injuries in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, as evidenced by increased occult blood scores, shortened colon length, and accumulated neutrophils. The level of IL-17A was also higher in the serum of asthmatic mice than wild-type mice. Interestingly, the pathologic scores, the proportion of Th17 cells, and neutrophil infiltration in the colon were markedly reduced after IL-17A blocking. Similarly, longer length, lower pathologic scores, and fewer neutrophils were also observed in the colon of IL-17-deficient asthmatic mice. More importantly, we demonstrated that severe gastrointestinal symptoms could accompany clinical asthmatics. The frequencies of Th17 cells and the mRNA expression of IL-17A in the peripheral blood of these patients were significantly enhanced. Besides, the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale scores positively correlated with the frequencies of Th17 in asthmatics. These findings enlighten that IL-17A aggravates asthma-induced intestinal immune injury by promoting neutrophil trafficking, which facilitates the exploration of new potential biomarkers to treat asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial PKM2 deacetylation by procyanidin B2-induced SIRT3 upregulation alleviates lung ischemia/reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35821123/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apoptosis is a critical event in the pathogenesis of lung ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), an important deacetylase predominantly localized in mitochondria, regulates diverse physiological processes, including apoptosis. However, the detailed mechanisms by which SIRT3 regulates lung I/R injury remain unclear. Many polyphenols strongly regulate the sirtuin family. In this study, we found that a polyphenol compound, procyanidin B2 (PCB2), activated SIRT3 in mouse lungs. Due to this effect, PCB2 administration attenuated histological lesions, relieved pulmonary dysfunction, and improved the survival rate of the murine model of lung I/R injury. Additionally, this treatment inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced A549 cell apoptosis and rescued Bcl-2 expression. Using Sirt3-knockout mice and specific SIRT3 knockdown in vitro, we further found that SIRT3 strongly protects against lung I/R injury. Sirt3 deficiency or enzymatic inactivation substantially aggravated lung I/R-induced pulmonary lesions, promoted apoptosis, and abolished PCB2-mediated protection. Mitochondrial pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) inhibits apoptosis by stabilizing Bcl-2. Here, we found that PKM2 accumulates and is hyperacetylated in mitochondria upon lung I/R injury. By screening the potential sites of PKM2 acetylation, we found that SIRT3 deacetylates the K433 residue of PKM2 in A549 cells. Transfection with a deacetylated mimic plasmid of PKM2 noticeably reduced apoptosis, while acetylated mimic transfection abolished the protective effect of PKM2. Furthermore, PKM2 knockdown or inhibition in vivo significantly abrogated the antiapoptotic effects of SIRT3 upregulation. Collectively, this study provides the first evidence that the SIRT3/PKM2 pathway is a protective target for the suppression of apoptosis in lung I/R injury. Moreover, this study identifies K433 deacetylation of PKM2 as a novel modification that regulates its anti-apoptotic activity. In addition, PCB2-mediated modulation of the SIRT3/PKM2 pathway may significantly protect against lung I/R injury, suggesting a novel prophylactic strategy for lung I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase δ Deficiency Protects From Antimyeloperoxidase Vasculitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35818684/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a systemic autoimmune disease in which glomerulonephritis is an important manifestation. Antibodies against myeloperoxidase (MPO) or proteinase 3 are thought to be important in pathogenesis. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ) mediates a number of effects in lymphocytes, but its role in myeloid cell responses is less clear. Therefore, this study was undertaken to assess this in a preclinical model of glomerulonephritis induced by the transfer of antibodies to MPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; D910A mice with inactive PI3Kδ were compared with wild-type controls. Disease protocols allowed for a comparison of experimental groups in the setting of both mild and more severe disease. Adoptive transfer experiments were performed, with flow cytometric analysis of digested kidneys taken at the end of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; With mild disease, D910A mice had fewer glomerular macrophages, fewer glomerular neutrophils, and reduced albuminuria compared with wild-type controls. With more severe disease, they also had fewer glomerular crescents and lower serum creatinine levels, indicating protection from acute kidney injury. Adoptive transfer experiments showed a defect in the recruitment of D910A monocytes to the diseased kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Mice with inactive PI3Kδ were protected from anti-MPO vasculitis. This is due to cell intrinsic defect in the recruitment of monocytes to the kidney. These findings suggest that PI3Kδ is a potential therapeutic target in AAV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell analysis highlights differences in druggable pathways underlying adaptive or fibrotic kidney regeneration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kidney has tremendous capacity to repair after acute injury, however, pathways guiding adaptive and fibrotic repair are poorly understood. We developed a model of adaptive and fibrotic kidney regeneration by titrating ischemic injury dose. We performed detailed biochemical and histological analysis and profiled transcriptomic changes at bulk and single-cell level (&amp;gt; 110,000 cells) over time. Our analysis highlights kidney proximal tubule cells as key susceptible cells to injury. Adaptive proximal tubule repair correlated with fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. We identify a specific maladaptive/profibrotic proximal tubule cluster after long ischemia, which expresses proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines and myeloid cell chemotactic factors. Druggability analysis highlights pyroptosis/ferroptosis as vulnerable pathways in these profibrotic cells. Pharmacological targeting of pyroptosis/ferroptosis in vivo pushed cells towards adaptive repair and ameliorates fibrosis. In summary, our single-cell analysis defines key differences in adaptive and fibrotic repair and identifies druggable pathways for pharmacological intervention to prevent kidney fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a common condition with high mortality. ALI/ARDS is caused by multiple etiologies, and the main clinical manifestations are progressive dyspnea and intractable hypoxemia. Currently, supportive therapy is the main ALI/ARDS treatment, and there remains a lack of targeted and effective therapeutic strategies. Macrophages are important components of innate immunity. M1 macrophages are pro-inflammatory, while M2 macrophages are anti-inflammatory and promote tissue repair. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are stem cells with broad application prospects in tissue regeneration due to their multi-directional differentiation potential along with their anti-inflammatory and paracrine properties. MSCs can regulate the balance of M1/M2 macrophage polarization to improve the prognosis of ALI/ARDS. In this paper, we review the mechanisms by which MSCs regulate macrophage polarization and the signaling pathways associated with polarization. This review is expected to provide new targets for the treatment of ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interleukin 24 promotes cell death in renal epithelial cells and is associated with acute renal injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a major cause of acute kidney injury. Many cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. IL24 is a member of the IL10 family and has gained importance because of its apoptosis-inducing effects in tumor disease besides its immunoregulative function. Littles is known about the role of IL24 in kidney disease. Using a mouse model, we found that IL24 is upregulated in the kidney after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and that tubular epithelial cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells are the source of IL24. Mice lacking IL24 are protected from renal injury and inflammation. Cell culture studies showed that IL24 induces apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells, which is accompanied by an increased endoplasmatic reticulum stress response. Moreover, IL24 induces robust expression of endogenous IL24 in tubular cells, fostering ER-stress and apoptosis. In kidney transplant recipients with delayed graft function and patients at high risk to develop acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery IL24 is upregulated in the kidney and serum. Taken together, IL24 can serve as a biomarker, plays an important mechanistic role involving both extracellular and intracellular targets, and is a promising therapeutic target in patients at risk of or with ischemia-induced acute kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Network Pharmacology and Experimental Validation to Explore the Mechanism of Qing-Jin-Hua-Tan-Decoction Against Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35873580/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qing-Jin-Hua-Tan-Decoction (QJHTD), a classic famous Chinese ancient prescription, has been used for treatment of pulmonary diseases since Ming Dynasty. A total of 22 prototype compounds of QJHTD absorbed into rat blood were chosen as candidates for the pharmacological network analysis and molecular docking. The targets from the intersection of compound target and ALI disease targets were used for GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Molecular docking was adopted to further verify the interactions between 22 components and the top 20 targets with higher degree values in the component-target-pathway network. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments were performed to verify the results of network pharmacology using SPR experiments, Western blot experiments, and the PMA-induced neutrophils to produce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) model. The compound-target-pathway network includes 176 targets and 20 signaling pathways in which the degree of MAPK14, CDK2, EGFR, F2, SRC, and AKT1 is higher than that of other targets and which may be potential disease targets. The biological processes in QJHTD for ALI mainly included protein phosphorylation, response to wounding, response to bacterium, regulation of inflammatory response, and so on. KEGG enrichment analyses revealed multiple signaling pathways, including lipid and atherosclerosis, HIF-1 signaling pathway, renin-angiotensin system, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation. The molecular docking results showed that baicalin, oroxylin A-7-glucuronide, hispidulin-7-O-β-D-glucuronide, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, tianshic acid, and mangiferin can be combined with most of the targets, which might be the core components of QJHTD in treatment of ALI. Direct binding ability of baicalein, wogonin, and baicalin to thrombin protein was all micromolar, and their KD values were 11.92 μM, 1.303 μM, and 1.146 μM, respectively, revealed by SPR experiments, and QJHTD could inhibit Src phosphorylation in LPS-activated neutrophils by Western blot experiments. The experimental results of PMA-induced neutrophils to produce NETs indicated that QJHTD could inhibit the production of NETs. This study revealed the active compounds, effective targets, and potential pharmacological mechanisms of QJHTD acting on ALI.

      <title>p53/sirtuin 1/NF-κB Signaling Axis in Chronic Inflammation and Maladaptive Kidney Repair After Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35874713/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation contributes to maladaptive kidney repair, but its regulation is unclear. Here, we report that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is downregulated after repeated low-dose cisplatin (RLDC) injury, and this downregulation leads to p65 acetylation and consequent NF-κB activation resulting in a persistent inflammatory response. RLDC induced the down-regulation of SIRT1 and activation of NF-κB, which were accompanied by chronic tubular damage, tubulointerstitial inflammation, and fibrosis in mice. Inhibition of NF-κB suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic phenotypes in RLDC-treated renal tubular cells. SIRT1 activation by its agonists markedly reduced the acetylation of p65 (a key component of NF-κB), resulting in the attenuation of the inflammatory and fibrotic responses. Conversely, knockdown of SIRT1 exacerbated these cellular changes. At the upstream, p53 was activated after RLDC treatment to repress SIRT1, resulting in p65 acetylation, NF-κB activation and transcription of inflammatory cytokines. In mice, SIRT1 agonists attenuated RLDC-induced chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and renal fibrosis. Together, these results unveil the p53/SIRT1/NF-κB signaling axis in maladaptive kidney repair following RLDC treatment, where p53 represses SIRT1 to increase p65 acetylation for NF-κB activation, leading to chronic renal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can result in prolonged pathologies collectively referred to as post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long COVID. To better understand the mechanism underlying long COVID biology, we compared the short- and long-term systemic responses in the golden hamster after either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 exceeded IAV in its capacity to cause permanent injury to the lung and kidney and uniquely affected the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory epithelium (OE). Despite a lack of detectable infectious virus, the OB and OE demonstrated myeloid and T cell activation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and an interferon response that correlated with behavioral changes extending a month after viral clearance. These sustained transcriptional changes could also be corroborated from tissue isolated from individuals who recovered from COVID-19. These data highlight a molecular mechanism for persistent COVID-19 symptomology and provide a small animal model to explore future therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Size-based effects of anthropogenic ultrafine particles on activation of human lung macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35839670/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anthropogenic particulate matter (PM), suspended air dust that can be inhaled by humans and deposited in the lungs, is one of the main pollutants in the industrialized cities atmosphere. Recent studies have shown that PM has adverse effects on respiratory diseases. These effects are mainly due to the ultrafine particles (PM0.1, PM &amp;lt; 100 nm), which, thanks to their PM size, are efficiently deposited in nasal, tracheobronchial, and alveolar regions. Pulmonary macrophages are a heterogeneous cell population distributed in different lung compartments, whose role in inflammatory response to injury is of particular relevance. In this study, we investigated the effect of PM0.1 on Human Lung Macrophages (HLMs) activation evaluated as proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine release, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]i). Furthermore, PM0.1, after removal of organic fraction, was fractionated in nanoparticles both smaller (NP20) and bigger (NP100) than 20 nm by a properlydeveloped analytical protocol, allowed isolating their individual contribution. Interestingly, while PM0.1 and NP20 induced stimulatory effects on HLM cytokines release, NP100 had not effect. In particular, PM0.1 induced IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, but not CXCL8, release from HLMs. Moreover, PM0.1, NP20 and NP100 did not induce β-glucuronidase release, a preformed mediator contained in HLMs. The long time necessary for cytokines release (18 h) suggested that PM0.1 and NP20 could induce ex-novo production of the tested mediators. Accordingly, after 6 h of incubation, PM0.1 and NP20 induced mRNA expression of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β. Moreover, NP20 induced ROS production and [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]i increase in a time-dependent manner, without producing cytotoxicity. Collectively, the present data highlight the main proinflammatory role of NP20 among PM fractions. This is particularly of concern because this fraction is not currently covered by legal limits as it is not easily measured at the exhausts by the available technical methodologies, suggesting that it is mandatory to search for new monitoring techniques and strategies for limiting NP20 formation&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deciphering the role of damage-associated molecular patterns and inflammatory responses in acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35809663/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and causes great mortality. ALI presents with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, cell death, destruction of alveoli-endothelial barriers, and neutrophil infiltration in lung tissues. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules released from damaged cells due to infection, trauma, etc. DAMPs activate innate and adaptive immunity, trigger inflammatory responses, and are important in the initiation and development of ALI. We reviewed the literatures on DAMPs in ALI. Alveolar macrophages (AMs), neutrophils, and epithelial cells (AECs) are important in the pathogenesis of ALI. We comprehensively analyzed the interaction between DAMPs and AMs, alveolar neutrophils, and AECs. During the initial stage of ALI, ruptured cell membranes or destroyed mitochondria release DAMPs. DAMPs activate the inflammasome in nearby sentinel immune cells, such as AMs. AMs produce IL-1β and other cytokines. These mediators upregulate adhesion molecules of the capillary endothelium that facilitate neutrophil recruitment. The recruited neutrophils detect DAMPs using formyl peptide receptors on the membrane, guiding their migration to the injured site. The accumulation of immune cells, cytokines, chemokines, proteases, etc., results in diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary hyperpermeability with protein-rich fluid retention. Some clinical studies have shown that patients with ALI with higher circulating DAMPs have higher mortality rates. In conclusion, DAMPs are important in the initiation and progression of ALI. The interactions between DAMPs and AMs, neutrophils, and AECs are important in ALI. This review comprehensively addresses the mechanisms of DAMPs and their interactions in ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Methyl eugenol protects the kidney from oxidative damage in mice by blocking the Nrf2 nuclear export signal through activation of the AMPK/GSK3β axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35794373/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disrupted redox homeostasis contributes to renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Abundant natural products can activate nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), thereby providing therapeutic benefits. Methyl eugenol (ME), an analog of the phenolic compound eugenol, has the ability to induce Nrf2 activity. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of ME against renal oxidative damage in vivo and in vitro. An IR-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) model was established in mice. ME (20 mg·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;·d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.p.) was administered to mice on 5 consecutive days before IR surgery. We showed that ME administration significantly attenuated renal destruction, improved the survival rate, reduced excessive oxidative stress and inhibited mitochondrial lesions in AKI mice. We further demonstrated that ME administration significantly enhanced Nrf2 activity and increased the expression of downstream antioxidative molecules. Similar results were observed in vitro in hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR)-exposed proximal tubule epithelial cells following pretreatment with ME (40 μmol·L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). In both renal oxidative damage models, ME induced Nrf2 nuclear retention in tubular cells. Using specific inhibitors (CC and DIF-3) and molecular docking, we demonstrated that ME bound to the binding pocket of AMPK with high affinity and activated the AMPK/GSK3β axis, which in turn blocked the Nrf2 nuclear export signal. In addition, ME alleviated the development of renal fibrosis induced by nonfatal IR, which is frequently encountered in the clinic. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ME modulates the AMPK/GSK3β axis to regulate the cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of Nrf2, resulting in Nrf2 nuclear retention and thereby enhancing antioxidant target gene transcription that protects the kidney from oxidative damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MUC1-mediated Macrophage Activation Promotes Colitis-associated Colorectal Cancer via Activating the Interleukin-6/ Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 Axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35809803/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; MUC1 is abnormally expressed in colorectal cancer, including colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), but its role in tumorigenesis is unclear. This study investigated MUC1&amp;rsquo;s effects in murine models of colitis and CAC and elucidated mechanisms of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Colitis and CAC were induced in mice by exposure to dextran sodium sulfate or azoxymethane plus dextran sodium sulphate. Clinical parameters, immune cell infiltration, and tumor development were monitored throughout disease progression. Experiments in knockout mice and bone marrow chimeras were combined with an exploration of immune cell abundance and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Deficiency of Muc1 suppressed inflammation, inhibited tumor progression, increased abundance of CD8+ T lymphocytes, and reduced abundance of macrophages in colon tumors. Bone marrow chimeras showed promotion of CAC was primarily mediated by Muc1-expressing hematopoietic cells, and that MUC1 promoted a pro-tumoral immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype within tumors. Mechanistic studies revealed that Muc1 deficiency remarkably reduced interleukin-6 levels in the colonic tissues and tumors that was mainly produced by infiltrating macrophages at day 21, 42, and 85. In bone marrow-derived macrophages, MUC1 promoted responsiveness to chemoattractant and promoted activation into a phenotype with high Il6 and Ido1 expression, secreting factors which inhibited CD8+ T cell proliferation. MUC1 potently drives macrophages to produce interleukin-6, which in turn drives a pro-tumorigenic activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in colon epithelial tumor and stromal cells, ultimately increasing the occurrence and development of CAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings provide cellular and molecular mechanisms for the pro-tumorigenic functions of MUC1 in the inflamed colon. Therapeutic strategies to inhibit MUC1 signal transduction warrant consideration for the prevention or therapy of CAC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil and Macrophage Response in Acinetobacter Baumannii Infection and Their Relationship to Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) infection has become a threat to global public health. AB is one of the main pathogens causing nosocomial infections, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia. AB easily develops resistance against a variety of antibiotics, which makes the treatment of AB infections difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to study new treatment plans like anti-infection immunity. Both animal models of AB infection and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; cell experiments show that macrophages are activated in the early stage of the immune response and regulate the recruitment of neutrophils, thus playing a role in clearing AB. AB components and the immune responses they induce can lead to injury of the infected organ, mostly in the lungs. Understanding the response of innate immunity to ABs at different stages after infection and the relationship between the response and lung injury can help to develop new immunotherapy methods and prevent lung injury. This article provides a comprehensive review of the response of neutrophils and macrophages to AB infection and their association with lung injury to develop effective therapies for AB infection and prevent lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oral administration of asparagine and 3-indolepropionic acid prolongs survival time of rats with traumatic colon injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35791006/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Traumatic colon injury (TCI) is a common disease during wartime. Prolongation of posttraumatic survival time is an effective approach to patient outcome improvement. However, there is a lack of basic research in this field. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying TCI progression and to develop novel regimens to buy time for TCI patients on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 669 Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Surgical colon incision was performed to generate the TCI rat model. The landscape of colon microbiota compositions was depicted using 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolites in the intestinal contents were detected by metabolomics profiling. The signaling transduction in the intestinal epithelium was investigated using antibody microarrays and Western blotting. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to measure the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in intestines and plasma for the detection of inflammatory responses. Diamine oxidase, D-lactate and endotoxin in plasma and protein expression of zonula occludens 1 and occludin were selected as the indicators of intestinal barrier permeability. To investigate alterations of microbiota symbiosis, the relative abundances of specific bacterial genera were detected using quantitative real-time PCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; As a type of lethal injury, TCI induced acute disruption of intestinal homeostasis, characterized by inflammatory responses, intestinal barrier hyperpermeability and microbiota dysbiosis (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Significant alterations in bacterial metabolic patterns were detected with decreases in many metabolites. After a series of screenings, we found that oral administration of asparagine (Asn) and 3-indolepropionic acid (IPA) effectively prolonged posttraumatic survival time (Asn plus IPA vs. Vehicle: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.105, 95% CI 0.031-0.356, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0003) and restored intestinal homeostasis in TCI rats (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Mechanistically, this combinational strategy protected the rats against TCI through synergistic activation of Akt signaling in the intestinal epithelium (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Abrupt dysregulation of intestinal homeostasis plays a critical role in the progression toward TCI-induced death. Oral administration of Asn plus IPA may serve as an effective regimen to restore intestinal functions and prolong the posttraumatic survival time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 Pathway Protects against Ferroptosis in Radiation-Induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35847598/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is one of the most common, serious, and dose-limiting toxicities of thoracic radiotherapy. A primary cause for this is the radiation-induced cell death. Ferroptosis is a recently recognized form of regulated cell death, characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS generated by irradiation might be the original trigger of ferroptosis in RILI. In addition, activation of the P62-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway has been shown to blunt ferroptosis and thus acts as a protective factor. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the protective effect of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway against radiation-induced ferroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells. First, we found that radiation induced ferroptosis in vitro using a RILI cell model, which could be significantly reduced by ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a specific ferroptosis inhibitor. Additionally, overexpression of P62 interacted with Keap1 to facilitate the translocation of NRF2 into the nucleus and promote the expression of its target proteins, including quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1). In summary, our results demonstrated that the activation of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway prevents radiation-induced ferroptosis in RILI cells, providing a theoretical basis of finding a potential therapeutic approach for RILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Raised Serum Markers of T Cell Activation and Exhaustion in Granulomatous-Lymphocytic Interstitial Lung Disease in Common Variable Immunodeficiency</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35789314/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35789314/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; About 20-30% of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) develop granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD) as one of several non-infectious complications to their immunodeficiency. The purpose of this study was to identify biomarkers that could distinguish GLILD from other non-infectious complications in CVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We analyzed serum biomarkers related to inflammation, pulmonary epithelium injury, fibrogenesis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and compared three subgroups of CVID: GLILD patients (n = 16), patients with other non-infectious complications (n = 37), and patients with infections only (n = 20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that GLILD patients had higher levels of sCD25, sTIM-3, IFN-γ, and TNF, reflecting T cell activation and exhaustion, compared to both CVID patients with other inflammatory complications and CVID with infections only. GLILD patients also had higher levels of SP-D and CC16, proteins related to pulmonary epithelium injury, as well as the ECM remodeling marker MMP-7, than patients with other non-infectious complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; GLILD patients have elevated serum markers of T cell activation and exhaustion, pulmonary epithelium injury, and ECM remodeling, pointing to potentially important pathways in GLILD pathogenesis, novel targets for therapy, and promising biomarkers for clinical evaluation of these patients.

      <title>CircRNA Samd4 induces cardiac repair after myocardial infarction by blocking mitochondria-derived ROS output</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35791879/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from oxygen-dependent mitochondrial metabolism are the essential drivers of cardiomyocyte (CM) cell-cycle arrest in adulthood. Mitochondria-localized circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in regulating mitochondria-derived ROS production, but their functions in cardiac regeneration are still unknown. Herein, we investigated the functions and underlying mechanism of mitochondria-localized circSamd4 in cardiac regeneration. We found that circSamd4 was selectively expressed in fetal and neonatal CMs. The transcription factor Nrf2 controlled circSamd4 expression by binding to the promoter of circSamd4 host gene. CircSamd4 overexpression reduced while circSamd4 silenced increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and subsequent oxidative DNA damage. Moreover, circSamd4 overexpression induced CM proliferation and prevented CM apoptosis, which reduced the size of the fibrotic area and improved cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI). Mechanistically, circSamd4 reduced oxidative stress generation and maintained mitochondrial dynamics by inducing the mitochondrial translocation of the Vcp protein, which downregulated Vdac1 expression and prevented the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) from opening. Our findings suggest that circSamd4 is a novel therapeutic target for heart failure after MI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles for renal therapeutics: State of the art and future perspective</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35779658/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kidney diseases are global public health concerns lacking effective treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both native and bioengineered EVs are prime candidates for next-generation renal therapeutics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVs can be tailored to target specific renal cells and prolong kidney retention for enhanced efficacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVs can act as natural therapeutic agents or smart drug carriers fighting against renal diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the ever-increasing burden of kidney disease, the need for developing new therapeutics to manage this disease has never been greater. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural membranous nanoparticles present in virtually all organisms. Given their excellent delivery capacity in the body, EVs have emerged as a frontier technology for drug delivery and have the potential to usher in a new era of nanomedicine for kidney disease. This review is focused on why EVs are such compelling drug carriers and how to release their fullest potentiality in renal therapeutics. We discuss the unique features of EVs compared to artificial nanoparticles and outline the engineering technologies and steps in developing EV-based therapeutics, with an emphasis on the emerging approaches to target renal cells and prolong kidney retention. We also explore the applications of EVs as natural therapeutics or as drug carriers in the treatment of renal disorders and present our views on the critical challenges in manufacturing EVs as next-generation renal therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Induction of reactive oxygen species by mechanical stretch drives endothelin production in neonatal pig renal epithelial cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35841629/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35841629/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vasoactive endothelin (ET) is generated by ET converting enzyme (ECE)-induced proteolytic processing of pro-molecule big ET to biologically active peptides. H2O2 has been shown to increase the expression of ECE1 via transactivation of its promoter. The present study demonstrates that H2O2 triggered ECE1-dependent ET1-3 production in neonatal pig proximal tubule (PT) epithelial cells. A uniaxial stretch of PT cells decreased catalase, increased NADPH oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4, and increased H2O2 levels. Stretch also increased cellular ECE1, an effect reversed by EUK-134 (a synthetic superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic), NOX inhibitor apocynin, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of NOX2 and NOX4. Short-term unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), an inducer of renal tubular cell stretch and oxidative stress, increased renal ET1-3 generation and vascular resistance (RVR) in neonatal pigs. Despite removing the obstruction, UUO-induced increase in RVR persisted, resulting in early acute kidney injury (AKI). ET receptor (ETR)-operated Ca2+ entry in renal microvascular smooth muscle (SM) via transient receptor potential channel 3 (TRPC3) channels reduced renal blood flow and increased RVR. Although acute reversible UUO (rUUO) did not change protein expression levels of ETR and TRPC3 in renal microvessels, inhibition of ECE1, ETR, and TRPC3 protected against renal hypoperfusion, RVR increase, and early AKI. These data suggest that mechanical stretch-driven oxyradical generation stimulates ET production in neonatal pig renal epithelial cells. ET activates renal microvascular SM TRPC3, leading to persistent vasoconstriction and reduction in renal blood flow. These mechanisms may underlie rUUO-induced renal insufficiency in infants.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lysophosphatidylcholine Alleviates Acute Lung Injury by Regulating Neutrophil Motility and Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35859904/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is predominantly initiated by bacterial infection and can cause systemic inflammation, which frequently leads to rapid death of the patient. However, this acute systemic inflammatory response requires further investigation from the perspectives of clinical judgment criteria and early treatment strategies for the relief of symptoms. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 18:0 may relieve septic symptoms, but the relevant mechanism is not clearly understood. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of LPC as a therapeutic treatment for acute inflammation in the lung induced by lipopolysaccharide in mice. Systemic inflammation of mice was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inoculation to investigate the role of LPC in the migration and the immune response of neutrophils during acute lung injury. By employing two-photon intravital imaging of the LPS-stimulated LysM-GFP mice and other &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; assays, we examined whether LPC alleviates the inflammatory effect of sepsis. We also tested the effect of LPC to human neutrophils from healthy control and sepsis patients. Our data showed that LPC treatment reduced the infiltration of innate immune cells into the lung. Specifically, LPC altered neutrophil migratory patterns and enhanced phagocytic efficacy in the damaged lung. Moreover, LPC treatment reduced the release of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET), which can damage tissue in the inflamed organ and exacerbate disease. It also reduced human neutrophil migration under inflammatory environment. Our results suggest that LPC can alleviate sepsis-induced lung inflammation by regulating the function of neutrophils. These findings provide evidence for the beneficial application of LPC treatment as a potential therapeutic strategy for sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting p65 to inhibit Cas3 transcription by Onjisaponin B for radiation damage therapy in p65&#43;/- mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35816993/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35816993/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In response to radiation injury, p65 becomes activated. The formation of p65 is one target of Onjisaponin B (OB), but it has not been studied in radioprotection. In addition, there is a binding site for p65 in the promoter region of Cas3. This study evaluates the use of OB as an intervention to modulate p65/Cas3 following radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to confirm that OB regulated the transcription of Cas3 via p65 to overcome radiation-induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Cells and mice were exposed to X-rays at a dose of 6 Gy. Immunofluorescence was used to locate intracellular p65. For the protein and mRNA analyses, Western blotting and RT-qPCR-based assays were conducted accordingly. HE staining was used to observe pathological changes in tissues. DNA damage was detected by the comet assay and DNA ladder assay. Next, apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and Hoechst staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with the radiation group, the expression levels of p-p65 and c-Cas3 in the drug group were significantly down-regulated by OB 20 µg/ml. When the expression of p65 was suppressed in V79 and TC cells, OB did not significantly inhibit the activation of p65 or Cas3 in response to irradiation, nor did it significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of p65 and subsequent nuclear translocation. Overexpression of p65 in V79 and MTEC-1 cells resulted in OB significantly inhibiting the activation of p65 and Cas3, and the phosphorylation and translocation of p65 into the nucleus. At 3 d for V79 cells and 24 h for MTEC-1 cells after radiation, compared with the Cas3 over plasmid transfection group, the drug transfection group had no significant effect on reducing apoptosis. In p65+/- mice, expression of the p65 gene was knocked down, leading to increased tissue apoptosis and inflammation, and serious tissue pathological changes. The inhibition of p65 activation by OB after radiation exposure was not apparent in the thymus, although it was observed in the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; OB interfered with radiation injury by targeting and regulating p65/Cas3. Therefore, it has been concluded that p65 is an important target molecule for the treatment of radiation injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TLR4-SIRT3 Mechanism Modulates Mitochondrial and Redox Homeostasis and Promotes EPCs Recruitment and Survival</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low survival rate of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; which are susceptible to adverse microenvironments including inflammation and oxidative stress has become one primary challenge of EPCs transplantation for regenerative therapy. Recent studies reported functional expression of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 on EPCs and dose-dependent effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on cellular oxidative stress and angiogenic properties. However, the involved mechanism has not yet been elucidated well, and the influence of TLR4 signaling on EPCs survival and function &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; is unknown. In the present study, we observed the effects of LPS and TLR4/SIRT3 on EPCs mitochondrial permeability and intracellular mitochondrial superoxide. We employed the monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arteriolar injury model to observe the effects of TLR4/SIRT3 on the recruitment and survival of transplanted EPCs. We found the destructive effects of 10 μg/mL LPS on mitochondrial homeostasis, and cellular viability was mediated by TLR4/SIRT3 signals at least partially, and the TLR4 mediates the early-stage recruitment of transplanted EPCs in pulmonary arteriolar inflammation injury; however, SIRT3 has more contribution to the survival of incorporated EPCs and ameliorated arteriolar remodeling in lung vascular tissue. The study provides insights for the critical role of TLR4/SIRT3 in LPS-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial disorder in EPCs &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. The TLR4/SIRT3 signaling is important for EPCs resistance against inflammation and oxidative stress and may represent a new manipulating target for developing efficient cell therapy strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tight Junctions, the Epithelial Barrier, and Toll-like Receptor-4 During Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung epithelium is constantly exposed to the environment and is critically important for the orchestration of initial responses to infectious organisms, toxins, and allergic stimuli, and maintenance of normal gaseous exchange and pulmonary function. The integrity of lung epithelium, fluid balance, and transport of molecules is dictated by the tight junctions (TJs). The TJs are formed between adjacent cells. We have focused on the topic of the TJ structure and function in lung epithelial cells. This review includes a summary of the last twenty years of literature reports published on the disrupted TJs and epithelial barrier in various lung conditions and expression and regulation of specific TJ proteins against pathogenic stimuli. We discuss the molecular signaling and crosstalk among signaling pathways that control the TJ structure and function. The Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) recognizes the pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns released during lung injury and inflammation and coordinates cellular responses. The molecular aspects of TLR4 signaling in the context of TJs or the epithelial barrier are not fully known. We describe the current knowledge and possible networking of the TLR4-signaling with cellular and molecular mechanisms of TJs, lung epithelial barrier function, and resistance to treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kidney targeting of formoterol containing polymeric nanoparticles improves recovery from ischemia reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35779607/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The β2 adrenergic receptor agonist, formoterol, is an inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis and restorer of mitochondrial and kidney function in acute and chronic models of kidney injury. Unfortunately, systemic administration of formoterol has the potential for adverse cardiovascular effects, increased heart rate, and decreased blood pressure. To minimize these effects, we developed biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric nanoparticles containing formoterol that target the kidney, thereby decreasing the effective dose, and lessen cardiovascular effects while restoring kidney function after injury. Male C57Bl/6 mice, treated with these nanoparticles daily, had reduced ischemia-reperfusion-induced serum creatinine and kidney cortex kidney injury molecule-1 levels by 78% and 73% respectively, compared to control mice six days after injury. With nanoparticle therapy, kidney cortical mitochondrial number and proteins reduced by ischemic injury, recovered to levels of sham-operated mice. Tubular necrosis was reduced 69% with nanoparticles treatment. Nanoparticles improved kidney recovery even when the dosing frequency was reduced from daily to two days per week. Finally, compared to treatment with formoterol-free drug alone, these nanoparticles did not increase heart rate nor decrease blood pressure. Thus, targeted kidney delivery of formoterol-containing nanoparticles is an improvement in standard formoterol therapy for ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injuries by decreasing the dose, dosing frequency, and cardiac side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a novel cell death method discovered in recent years. It is usually accompanied by massive accumulations of iron and lipid peroxidation during cell death. Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis is closely associated with the pathophysiological processes of many diseases, such as tumors, neurological diseases, localized ischemia-reperfusion injury, kidney injury, and hematological diseases. How to intervene in the incidence and development of associated diseases by regulating the ferroptosis of cells has become a hot topic of research. This article provides a review of the role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of acute kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Characterization of a flexible AAV-DTR/DT mouse model of acute epithelial lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35762632/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal models are important to mimic certain pathways or biological aspects of human pathologies including acute and chronic pulmonary diseases. We developed a novel and flexible mouse model of acute epithelial lung injury based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) variant 6.2-mediated expression of the human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR). Following intratracheal administration of diphtheria toxin (DT), a cell-specific death of bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells can be observed. In contrast to other lung injury models, the here described mouse model provides the possibility of targeted injury using specific tropisms of AAV vectors or cell-type-specific promotors to drive the human DTR expression. Also, generation of cell-specific mouse lines is not required. Detailed characterization of the AAV-DTR/DT mouse model including titration of viral genome (vg) load and administered DT amount revealed increasing cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; macrophages, neutrophils, and unspecified cells) and elevation of degenerated cells and infiltrated leukocytes in lung tissue, dependent of vg load and DT dose. Cytokine levels in BAL fluid showed different patterns with higher vg load, e.g., IFNγ, TNFα, and IP10 increasing and IL-5 and IL-6 decreasing, whereas lung function was not affected. In addition, laser-capture microdissection (LCM)-based proteomics of bronchial epithelium and alveolar tissue revealed upregulated immune and inflammatory responses in all regions and extracellular matrix deposition in infiltrated alveoli. Overall, our novel AAV-DTR/DT model allows investigation of repair mechanisms following epithelial injury and resembles specific mechanistic aspects of acute and chronic pulmonary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FGF1 alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via suppression of inflammation and oxidative stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35764933/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are devastating clinical disorders with high mortality, and for which more effective therapies are urgently needed. FGF1, the prototype member of the FGF family, is shown to exert protective effects against injurious stimuli in multiple disease models. Here we aimed to evaluate whether FGF1 pretreatment is protective against LPS-induced ALI and elucidate the potential underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; For drug-treated groups, C57B/6 mice received a single i.p. injection of FGF1 (1 mg/kg) 1 h before the LPS challenge or not. To induce the ALI model, the mice were treated by intratracheal instillation of LPS (5 mg/kg). Then, histopathological changes in lung tissues were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. ELISA and qPCR assays were used to detect pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in BALF and lung tissues, respectively. The total number of inflammatory cells (neutrophils and macrophages) in BALF were counted using the Wright-Giemsa method. The expressions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using their respective kits. Western blot and immunostaining were used to evaluate the expressions of antioxidants (Nrf-2, HO-1, SOD2, GPX4, and Catalase), as well as the inflammatory and/or apoptosis-related factors (TLR4, NF-κB, and Cleaved- caspase 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; FGF1 pretreatment significantly ameliorated the LPS-induced histopathological changes, reduced lung wet/dry ratios, ROS and MDA levels, total BALF protein, inflammatory cell infiltration, proinflammatory cytokine levels, and significantly increased the expression of antioxidant proteins (Nrf-2, HO-1, Catalase, and SOD2). In addition, FGF1 pretreatment significantly reduced the expression of TLR4 and cleaved- caspase 3, inhibited NF-κB activation, and reduced LPS-induced cell apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Altogether, our results suggest that FGF1 pretreatment is protective against LPS-induced ALI through mediating anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may be attributed to the downregulation of TLR4 expression and inhibition of NF-κB activation, as well as promotion of antioxidant defenses. Therefore, FGF1 administration may prove beneficial in preventative strategies for ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MicroRNA-1224-5p Aggravates Sepsis-Related Acute Lung Injury in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35799888/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in the development of sepsis-related acute lung injury (ALI). MicroRNA-1224-5p (miR-1224-5p) plays critical roles in regulating inflammatory response and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The present study is aimed at investigating the role and underlying mechanisms of miR-1224-5p in sepsis-related ALI. Mice were intratracheally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 mg/kg) for 12 h to induce sepsis-related ALI. To manipulate miR-1224-5p level, mice were intravenously injected with the agomir, antagomir, or matched controls for 3 consecutive days. Murine peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 6 h to further validate the role of miR-1224-5p &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. To inhibit adenosine 5&amp;rsquo;-monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKα) or peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ), compound C or GW9662 was used &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. We found that miR-1224-5p levels in lungs were elevated by LPS injection, and that the miR-1224-5p antagomir significantly alleviated LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and ALI in mice. Conversely, the miR-1224-5p agomir aggravated inflammatory response, ROS generation, and pulmonary dysfunction in LPS-treated mice. In addition, the miR-1224-5p antagomir reduced, while the miR-1224-5p agomir aggravated LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in murine peritoneal macrophages. Further findings revealed that miR-1224-5p is directly bound to the 3&amp;rsquo;-untranslated regions of PPAR-γ and subsequently suppressed PPAR-γ/AMPKα axis, thereby aggravating LPS-induced ALI &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. We demonstrate for the first time that endogenous miR-1224-5p is a critical pathogenic factor for inflammation and oxidative damage during LPS-induced ALI through inactivating PPAR-γ/AMPKα axis. Targeting miR-1224-5p may help to develop novel approaches to treat sepsis-related ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prediction of the Mechanism of Sodium Butyrate against Radiation-Induced Lung Injury in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Dynamic Simulations and Molecular Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35837112/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a severe side effect of radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ,and one of the major hindrances to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. Previous studies have confirmed that sodium butyrate (NaB) has potential of anti-radiation toxicity. However, the mechanism of the protective effect of NaB against RILI has not yet been clarified. This study aimed to explore the underlying protective mechanisms of NaB against RILI in NSCLC through network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The predictive target genes of NaB were obtained from the PharmMapper database and the literature review. The involved genes of RILI and NSCLC were predicted using OMIM and GeneCards database. The intersectional genes of drug and disease were identified using the Venny tool and uploaded to the Cytoscape software to identify 5 core target genes of NaB associated with RILI. The correlations between the 5 core target genes and EGFR, PD-L1, immune infiltrates, chemokines and chemokine receptors were analyzed using TIMER 2.0, TIMER and TISIDB databases. We constructed the mechanism maps of the 3 key signaling pathways using the KEGG database based on the results of GO and KEGG analyses from Metascape database. The 5 core target genes and drug were docked using the AutoDock Vina tool and visualized using PyMOL software. GROMACS software was used to perform 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation. Irradiation-induced lung injury model in mice were established to assess the therapeutic effects of NaB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 51 intersectional genes involved in NaB against RILI in NSCLC were identified. The 5 core target genes were AKT1, TP53, NOTCH1, SIRT1, and PTEN. The expressions of the 5 core target genes were significantly associated with EGFR, PD-L1, immune infiltrates, chemokines and chemokine receptors, respectively. The results from GO analysis of the 51 intersectional genes revealed that the biological processes were focused on the regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, oxidative stress and cell death, while the three key KEGG pathways were enriched in PI3K-Akt signal pathway, p53 signal pathway, and FOXO signal pathway. The docking of NaB with the 5 core target genes showed affinity and stability, especially AKT1. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments showed that NaB treatment significantly protected mice from RILI, with reduced lung histological damage. In addition, NaB treatment significantly inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; NaB may protect patients from RILI in NSCLC through multiple target genes including AKT1, TP53, NOTCH1, SIRT1 and PTEN, with multiple signaling pathways involving, including PI3K-Akt pathway, p53 pathway, and FOXO pathways. Our findings effectively provide a feasible theoretical basis to further elucidate the mechanism of NaB in the treatment of RILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SM22α cell-specific HIF stabilization mitigates hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35762602/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though survival rates for preterm infants are improving, the incidence of chronic lung disease of infancy, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), remains high. Histologically, BPD is characterized by larger and fewer alveoli. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) may be protective in the context of hyperoxia-induced lung injury, but the cell-specific effects of HIF expression in neonatal lung injury remain unknown. Thus, we sought to determine whether HIF stabilization in SM22α-expressing cells can limit hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury. We generated SM22α-specific HIF-1α-stabilized mice (&lt;em&gt;SM22α-PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice) by cross-breeding SM22α-promotor-driven Cre recombinase mice with prolyl hydroxylase &lt;em&gt;PHD1&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PHD2&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Neonatal mice were randomized to 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (normoxia) or 80% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (hyperoxia) exposure for 14 days. For the hyperoxia recovery studies, neonatal mice were recovered from normoxia for an additional 10 wk. SM22α-specific HIF-1α stabilization mitigated hyperoxia-induced lung injury and preserved microvessel density compared with control mice for both neonates and adults. In &lt;em&gt;SM22α-PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) were more proliferative and pulmonary arteries expressed more collagen IV compared with control mice, even under hyperoxic conditions. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) mRNA expression in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) was greater in &lt;em&gt;SM22α-PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; compared with control mice in both normoxia and hyperoxia. Pulmonary endothelial cells (PECs) cocultured with PASMC isolated from &lt;em&gt;SM22α-PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice formed more tubes and branches with greater tube length compared with PEC cocultured with PASMC isolated from &lt;em&gt;SM22α-PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Addition of Ang2 recombinant protein further augmented tube formation for both &lt;em&gt;PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; PASMC. Cell-specific deletion of PHD1 and 2 selectively increases HIF-1α expression in SM22α-expressing cells and protects neonatal lung development despite prolonged hyperoxia exposure. HIF stabilization in SM22α-expressing cells preserved endothelial cell proliferation, microvascular density, increased angiopoietin-2 expression, and lung structure, suggesting a role for cell-specific HIF-1α stabilization to prevent neonatal lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The down-regulation of XBP1, an unfolded protein response effector, promotes acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease transition</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35765067/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is closely linked to the pathogenesis of renal injuries. However, the role of XBP1, a crucial regulator of adaptive UPR, remains unclear during the transition from acute kidney injury (AKI) to chronic kidney disease (CKD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We characterized XBP1 expressions in different mouse models of kidney injuries, including unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (UIRI), unilateral ureteral obstruction, and adenine-induced CKD, followed by generating proximal tubular XBP1 conditional knockout (XBP1&lt;sup&gt;cKO&lt;/sup&gt;) mice for examining the influences of XBP1. Human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) were silenced of XBP1 to conduct proteomic analysis and investigate the underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We showed a tripartite activation of UPR in injured kidneys. XBP1 expressions were attenuated after AKI and inversely correlated with the severity of post-AKI renal fibrosis. XBP1&lt;sup&gt;cKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited more severe renal fibrosis in the UIRI model than wide-type littermates. Silencing XBP1 induced HK-2 cell cycle arrest in G2M phase, inhibited cell proliferation, and promoted TGF-β1 secretion. Proteomic analysis identified TNF receptor associated protein 1 (Trap1) as the potential downstream target transcriptionally regulated by XBP1s. Trap1 overexpression can alleviate silencing XBP1 induced profibrotic factor expressions and cell cycle arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The loss of XBP1 in kidney injury was profibrotic, and the process was mediated by autocrine and paracrine regulations in combination. The present study identified the XBP1-Trap1 axis as an instrumental mechanism responsible for post-AKI fibrosis, which is a novel regulatory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhalation of Salvianolic Acid B Prevents Fine Particulate Matter-Induced Acute Airway Inflammation and Oxidative Stress by Downregulating the LTR4/MyD88/NLRP3 Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35795853/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is a serious threat to human health. Inhaled fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can cause inflammation and oxidative stress in the airway; however, the mechanisms responsible for this effect have yet to be elucidated and there are no specific drugs that can prevent and treat this condition. In the present study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms underlying the inhalation of salvianolic acid B (SalB) on PM2.5-induced airway inflammation and oxidative stress. We used a PM2.5-induced mouse model of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, along with a human epithelial cell model, to study the action and mechanisms of SalB by histopathology, real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, flow cytometry, and western blotting. SalB treatment markedly inhibited the PM2.5-induced increase in the number of neutrophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, improved the infiltration of inflammatory cells in lung tissue, and reduced injury in the alveolar septum. Furthermore, SalB reduced the mRNA and protein levels of interleukin- (IL-) 1β, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) α, keratinocyte (KC), and transforming growth factor- (TGF-) β1 in lung tissues and the protein levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6, and TGF-β1 in human epithelial cells. SalB treatment also significantly prevented the reduction of levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase in lung tissue and reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species in human epithelial cells induced by PM2.5. Furthermore, SalB and the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) inhibitor ST2825 inhibited the expression levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), MyD88, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF-6), and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), as well as the phosphorylation of downstream Erk1/2 and P38 in lung tissue and epithelial cells. SalB protects against PM2.5-induced airway inflammation and oxidative stress in a manner that is associated with the inhibition of the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF-6/NLRP3 pathway and downstream signals ERK1/2 and P38.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microvesicles Derived from Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Enhance Alveolar Type II Cell Proliferation and Attenuate Lung Inflammation in a Rat Model of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35795773/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is known that exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) alleviate hyperoxic lung injury of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in animal models, the role of microvesicles (MVs) derived from hUCMSCs in BPD is poorly defined. Furthermore, antenatal inflammation has been linked to high risk of BPD in preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to explore whether MVs derived from hUCMSCs can preserve lung structure and function in an antenatal lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced BPD rat model and to clarify the underlying mechanism. We demonstrate that antenatal LPS induced alveolar simplification, altered lung function, and dysregulated pulmonary vasculature, which restored by hUCMSCs and MVs treatment. Furthermore, MVs were large vesicles with a diameter of 100-900 nanometers and mostly uptaken by alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2) and macrophages. Compared with the LPS-exposed group, MVs restored the AT2 cell number and SP-C expression in vivo and promoted the proliferation of AT2 cells in vitro. MVs also restored the level of IL-6 and IL-10 in lung homogenate. Additionally, PTEN/AKT and MAPK pathways were associated with the protection of MVs. Taken together, this study suggests MVs derived from hUCMSCs improve lung architecture and function in an antenatal LPS-induced BPD rat model by promoting AT2 cell proliferation and attenuating lung inflammation; thus, MVs provide a promising therapeutic vehicle for BPD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The protective effects of Mai-Luo-Ning injection against LPS-induced acute lung injury via the TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35793597/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35793597/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe inflammatory disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Various therapeutic strategies for ALI have been proposed over the last few decades; however, the treatment options remain limited. Mai-Luo-Ning injection (MLN), a traditional Chinese medical formulation, has been extensively used for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Nevertheless, the effects of MLN on ALI remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to investigate the protective and therapeutic effects of MLN on lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI mouse models and RAW 264.7 cells, and further explore the underlying mechanism of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The therapeutic activity of MLN was evaluated using an &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; ALI model and an in vitro model of RAW 264.7 macrophages. UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS was used to investigate the chemical constituents of the MLN. The material basis and potential protective mechanism of MLN were analyzed using network pharmacology. The roles of MLN in inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/ nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signalling pathway were investigated via western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments demonstrated that MLN ameliorated LPS-induced histological changes in lung tissues and reduced lung wet/dry weight ratio, total protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and myeloperoxidase activity. Furthermore, MLN downregulated the &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and in vitro expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that MLN could act synergistically through multiple targets and pathways and exert a protective effect, possibly through inhibiting TLR4/ NF-κB signalling pathways. Western blotting and immunofluorescence experiments further confirmed that MLN could regulate the expression of TLR4, MyD88, phospho-IκB-α, and phospho-NF-κB p65 in the TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway and decrease the translocation of phospho-NF-κB p65 into the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study suggests that MLN has a potential protective effect against LPS-induced ALI, which might be associated with the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway. Therefore, MLN is worthy of further investigation as a potential candidate for the treatment of ALI in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Expression of DEL-1 in alveolar epithelial cells prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and eosinophil recruitment in acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35764019/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expression of DEL-1 in alveolar epithelial cells is repressed in ALI mice;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEL-1 inhibits LPS-induced lung injury in mice;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEL-1 prevents eosinophil recruitment in LPS-induced mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infection is a major cause of acute lung injury (ALI). Developmental endothelial locus-1 (DEL-1) is an immunomodulatory mediator secreted by the endothelial cells. This study aimed to investigate the role of DEL-1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mouse models and its ability to regulate on eosinophil recruitment. Male C57BL/6 mice were administered an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated DEL-1 overexpression vector via intratracheal injection. Twenty-one days after vector instillation, mice were challenged with LPS (5 mg/kg body weight). Lung injury was evaluated using haematoxylin-eosin staining, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbnent assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses. DEL-1 was expressed in alveolar epithelial cells of mice. Compared with that in the control group, DEL-1 was expressed at low levels in the lungs of LPS-challenged mice. LPS injured the lungs in mice, as evidenced by an increase in alveolar wall thickness, inflammatory cell infiltration in the stroma, and alveolar collapse. AAV-mediated DEL-1 overexpression attenuated LPS-induced lung injury and inhibited the release of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. DEL-1 overexpression also attenuated LPS-induced oxidative stress by decreasing lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activities and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In addition, DEL-1 prevented eosinophil recruitment into lung tissues and inhibited eotaxin production. This study revealed the beneficial role of DEL-1 in preventing LPS-induced ALI in mice. Therefore, DEL-1 can protect lung tissues against LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and eosinophil recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insulin-incubated palladium clusters promote recovery after brain injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35752849/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a cause of disability and death worldwide, but there are currently no specific treatments for this condition. Release of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the injured brain leads to a series of pathological changes; thus, eliminating ROS could be a potential therapeutic strategy. Herein, we synthesized insulin-incubated ultrasmall palladium (Pd@insulin) clusters via green biomimetic chemistry. The Pd@insulin clusters, which were 3.2 nm in diameter, exhibited marked multiple ROS-scavenging ability testified by the theoretical calculation. Pd@insulin could be rapidly excreted via kidney-urine metabolism and induce negligible adverse effects after a long-time treatment in vivo. In a TBI mouse model, intravenously injected Pd@insulin clusters aggregated in the injured cortex, effectively suppressed excessive ROS production, and significantly rescued motor function, cognition and spatial memory. We found that the positive therapeutic effects of the Pd@insulin clusters were mainly attributed to their ROS-scavenging ability, as they inhibited excessive neuroinflammation, reduced cell apoptosis, and prevented neuronal loss. Therefore, the ability of Pd@insulin clusters to effectively eliminate ROS, as well as their simple structure, easy synthesis, low toxicity, and rapid metabolism may facilitate their clinical translation for TBI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ISM1 suppresses LPS-induced acute lung injury and post-injury lung fibrosis in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35752760/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) are clinical syndromes characterized by acute lung inflammation, pulmonary edema and hypoxemia, with up to 50% mortality rate without effective pharmacological therapy. Following the acute inflammation, repair and remodeling occurs which in some cases resulting in lung fibrosis. The pathophysiology of ALI/ARDS remains incompletely understood. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice have been widely used as a model to study human ALI/ARDS. Isthmin 1 (ISM1) is a secreted protein highly abundant in mouse lung. We have previously reported that upon intratracheal LPS instillation, ISM1 expression in the lung is further upregulated. Recently, we also reported that ISM1 is an anti-inflammatory protein in the lung with &lt;em&gt;Ism1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice presenting spontaneous chronic low-grade lung inflammation and obvious emphysema at young adult stage. However, what role ISM1 plays in ALI/ARDS and lung fibrosis remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Using &lt;em&gt;Ism1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice and intratracheal LPS-induced ALI, and local delivery of recombinant ISM1 (rISM1), we investigated the role ISM1 plays in ALI and post-ALI lung fibrosis using flow cytometry, Western blot, antibody array, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescent and other histological staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We reveal that ISM1 deficiency in mice led to an intensified acute lung inflammation upon intratracheal LPS challenge, with a heightened leukocyte infiltration including neutrophils and monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages, as well as upregulation of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Although innate immune cells largely subsided to the baseline by day 7 post-LPS challenge in both wild-type and &lt;em&gt;Ism1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, &lt;em&gt;Ism1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lung showed increased post-ALI fibrosis from day 9 post-LPS treatment with increased myofibroblasts, excessive collagen accumulation and TGF-β upregulation. The heightened lung fibrosis remained on day 28 post-LPS. Moreover, intranasal delivered recombinant ISM1 (rISM1) effectively suppressed LPS-induced acute lung inflammation and ALI, and rISM1 suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB activation in cultured mouse alveolar macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Together with our previous report, this work further established ISM1 as an endogenous anti-inflammation protein in the lung, restraining excessive host inflammatory response to LPS-triggered ALI and suppressing post-ALI lung fibrosis likely through suppressing NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a distinct type of programmed cell death (PCD) that depends on iron and is characterized by the accumulation of intracellular iron, exhaustion of glutathione, deactivation of glutathione peroxidase, and promotion of lipid peroxidation. Recently, accumulated investigations have demonstrated that ferroptosis is strongly correlated with the initiation and development of many lung diseases. In this review, we summarized the contribution of ferroptosis to the pathologic process of lung diseases, namely, obstructive lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cystic fibrosis), interstitial lung diseases (pulmonary fibrosis of different causes), pulmonary diseases of vascular origin (ischemia-reperfusion injury and pulmonary hypertension), pulmonary infections (bacteria, viruses, and fungi), acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and lung cancer. We also discussed the therapeutic potential of targeting ferroptosis for these lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Palmatine alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via interfering the interaction of TAK1 and TAB1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe clinical disease marked by uncontrolled inflammation response which lacks effective medicines. Accumulative evidence has indicated that macrophages are therapeutic targets for treating ALI because of its critical role in the inflammatory response.Palmatine (PAL), an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from natural plants, exhibits effective anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-oxidation activities. Here we reported that PAL alleviated LPS-induced acute lung injury and attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration especially neutrophils. Moreover, PAL also attenuated the production of TNF-α, CXCL-1, CXCL-2 and nitric oxide in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In addition, PAL remarkably reduced LPS-induced expression of TNF-α, CXCL-1 and CXCL-2 in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) and alveolar macrophages (AMs). Treatment with PAL inhibited the phosphorylation and interaction of TAK1/TAB1, which in turn attenuated the p38 MAPK and NF-κB signal pathways in BMDMs. Our results indicated that PAL ameliorated LPS-induced ALI by inhibiting macrophage activation through inhibiting NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways, suggesting that PAL has anti-inflammation effect on ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion injury is an inevitable event during organ transplantation and represents a primary risk factor for the development of early graft dysfunction in lung, heart, liver, and kidney transplant recipients. Recent studies have implicated recipient neutrophils as key mediators of this process and also have found that early innate immune responses after transplantation can ultimately augment adaptive alloimmunity and affect late graft outcomes. Here, we discuss signaling pathways involved in neutrophil recruitment and activation after ischemia-mediated graft injury in solid organ transplantation with an emphasis on lung allografts, which have been the focus of recent studies. These findings suggest novel therapeutic interventions that target ischemia-reperfusion injury-mediated graft dysfunction in transplant recipients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yu-Ping-Feng Formula Ameliorates Alveolar-Capillary Barrier Injury Induced by Exhausted-Exercise via Regulation of Cytoskeleton</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35814249/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Yu-ping-feng powder (YPF) is a compound traditional Chinese medicine extensively used in China for respiratory diseases. However, the role of YPF in alveolar-capillary barrier dysfunction remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the effect and potential mechanism of YPF on alveolar-capillary barrier injury induced by exhausted exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish an exhausted-exercise model by using a motorized rodent treadmill. YPF at doses of 2.18 g/kg was administrated by gavage before exercise training for 10 consecutive days. Food intake-weight/body weight, blood gas analysis, lung water percent content, BALF protein concentration, morphological observation, quantitative proteomics, real-time PCR, and Western blot were performed. A rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell line (PMVEC) subjected to hypoxia was applied for assessing the related mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; YPF attenuated the decrease of food intake weight/body weight, improved lung swelling and hemorrhage, alleviated the increase of lung water percent content and BALF protein concentration, and inhibited the impairment of lung morphology. In addition, YPF increased the expression of claudin 3, claudin 18, occludin, VE-cadherin, and β-catenin, attenuated the epithelial and endothelial hyperpermeability in vivo and/or in vitro, and the stress fiber formation in PMVECs after hypoxia. Quantitative proteomics discovered that the effect of YPF implicated the Siah2-ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway, Gng12-PAK1-MLCK, and RhoA/ROCK, which was further confirmed by Western blot. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD032737.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; YPF ameliorated alveolar-capillary barrier injury induced by exhausted exercise, which is accounted for at least partly by the regulation of cytoskeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Farnesoid X receptor protects against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury by regulating the transcription of ferroptosis-related genes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35767918/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side effects of cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, include nephrotoxicity. Previous studies have reported that cisplatin induces ferroptosis and lipid peroxide accumulation. Ferroptosis, a type of regulated cell death, is characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Although previous studies have examined the regulation of ferroptosis in acute kidney injury (AKI), the regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis has not been elucidated. Here, the ability of activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) to attenuate cisplatin-induced AKI through the regulation of ferroptosis was examined. FXR deficiency exhibited more ferroptosis responses, such as increase in lipid peroxidation, iron content and heme oxygenase 1 protein, and a decrease in glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio and glutathione peroxidase 4 levels in HK2 cells and mice. Increased blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and ferroptotic responses in the cisplatin-induced AKI mouse model were mitigated upon treatment with the FXR agonist GW4064 but were exacerbated in FXR knockout mice. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that ferroptosis-associated genes were novel targets of FXR. FXR agonist upregulated the expression of lipid and glutathione metabolism-related genes and downregulated cell death-related genes. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, using mice renal tissues, revealed that agonist-activated FXR could bind to its known target genes (Slc51a, Slc51b, Osgin1, and Mafg) and ferroptosis-related genes (Aifm2, Ggt6, and Gsta4). Furthermore, activated FXR-dependent MAFG, a transcriptional repressor, could bind to Hmox1, Nqo1, and Tf in the renal tissues of FXR agonist-treated mice. These findings indicate that activated FXR regulates the transcription of ferroptosis-related genes and protects against cisplatin-induced AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of polycomb repressive complex 2 by targeting EED protects against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35734954/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a multicomponent complex with methyltransferase activity that catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Interaction of the epigenetic reader protein EED with EZH2, a catalytic unit of PRC, allosterically stimulates PRC2 activity. In this study, we investigated the role and underlying mechanism of the PRC2 in acute kidney injury (AKI) by using EED226, a highly selective PRC2 inhibitor, to target EED. Administration of EED226 improved renal function, attenuated renal pathological changes, and reduced renal tubular cell apoptosis in a murine model of cisplatin-induced AKI. In cultured renal epithelial cells, treatment with either EED226 or EED siRNA also ameliorated cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, EED226 treatment inhibited cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of p53 and FOXO3a, two transcriptional factors contributing to apoptosis, and preserved expression of Sirtuin 3 and PGC1α, two proteins associated with mitochondrial protection in vivo and in vitro. EED226 was also effective in enhancing renal tubular cell proliferation, suppressing expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines, and reducing infiltration of macrophages to the injured kidney. These data suggest that inhibition of the PRC2 activity by targeting EED can protect against cisplatin-induced AKI by promoting the survival and proliferation of renal tubular cells and inhibiting inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 promotes acute kidney injury by alleviating poly ADP ribose polymerase 1 degradation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35752325/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35752325/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel biomarker, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), is used clinically to predict different types of acute kidney injury (AKI) and has drawn significant attention as a urinary biomarker. However, as a secreted protein in the circulation of patients with AKI, it is unclear whether IGFBP7 acts as a key regulator in AKI progression, and if mechanisms underlying its upregulation still need to be determined. Here we found that IGFBP7 is highly expressed in the blood and urine of patients and mice with AKI, possibly via a c-Jun-dependent mechanism, and is positively correlated with kidney dysfunction. Global knockout of IGFBP7 ameliorated kidney dysfunction, inflammatory responses, and programmed cell death in murine models of cisplatin-, kidney ischemia/reperfusion-, and lipopolysaccharide-induced AKI. IGFBP7 mainly originated from kidney tubular epithelial cells. Conditional knockout of IGFBP7 from the kidney protected against AKI. By contrast, rescue of IGFBP7 expression in IGFBP7-knockout mice restored kidney damage and inflammation. IGFBP7 function was determined in vitro using recombinant IGFBP7 protein, IGFBP7 knockdown, or overexpression. Additionally, IGFBP7 was found to bind to poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) and inhibit its degradation by antagonizing the E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 4 (RNF4). Thus, IGFBP7 in circulation acts as a biomarker and key mediator of AKI by inhibiting RNF4/PARP1-mediated tubular injury and inflammation. Hence, over-activation of the IGFBP7/PARP1 axis represents a promising target for AKI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liquiritigenin protects against myocardial ischemic by inhibiting oxidative stress, apoptosis, and L-type Ca2&#43; channels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35747908/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquiritigenin (Lq) offers cytoprotective effects against various cardiac injuries, but its beneficial effects on myocardial ischemic (MI) injury and the related mechanisms remain unclear. In the in vivo study, an animal model of MI was induced by intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol (Iso, 85 mg/kg). ECG, heart rate, serum levels of CK and CK-MB, histopathological changes, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were all measured. In vitro, H9c2 cells were divided into four groups and treated for 24 hr with liquiritigenin (30 μmol/L and 100 μmol/L) followed with CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (800 μmol/L) for another 24 hr. Cell viability, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) were then assessed. The L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current (I&lt;sub&gt;Ca-L&lt;/sub&gt;) was detected using a patch clamp technique on isolated rat ventricular myocytes. The myocyte contraction and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients were measured using an IonOptix detection system. The remarkable cardiac injury and generation of intracellular ROS induced by Iso were alleviated via treatment with Lq. CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; administration induced cell apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload in H9c2; Lq reduces these deleterious effects of CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Meanwhile, Lq blocked I&lt;sub&gt;Ca-L&lt;/sub&gt; in a dose-dependent manner. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of Lq was 110.87 μmol/L. Lq reversibly reduced the amplitude of cell contraction as well as the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. The results show that Lq protects against MI injury by antioxidation, antiapoptosis, counteraction mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibition of I&lt;sub&gt;Ca-L&lt;/sub&gt;, thus damping intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cardiac Spinal Afferent Denervation Attenuates Renal Dysfunction in Rats With Cardiorenal Syndrome Type 2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35818505/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epicardial application of RTX at the time of MI largely prevented renal dysfunction, attenuated renal congestion, and partially restored renal blood flow in rats with CHF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RNA sequencing analysis showed that renal injury, inflammation, hypoxia, and apoptosis genes were significantly up-regulated in the renal tissue of CHF rats, which was largely prevented by epicardial RTX at the time of MI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cardiac afferent ablation by intra–stellate ganglia injection of RTX or unilateral renal denervation 4 weeks after MI had similar renal protective effects on renal tubular damage in CHF rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These data provide evidence for cardiac spinal afferent modulation of renal function and a potential targeted therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiorenal syndrome type 2 (CRS2) is defined as a chronic cardiovascular disease, usually chronic heart failure (CHF), resulting in chronic kidney disease. We hypothesized that the cardiac spinal afferent reflex (CSAR) plays a critical role in the development of CRS2. Our data suggest that cardiac afferent ablation by resiniferatoxin not only improves cardiac function but also benefits the kidneys and increases long-term survival in the myocardial infarction model of CHF. We also found that renal denervation has a similar reno-protective effect in CHF rats. We believe this novel work contributes to the development of a unique neuromodulation therapy to treat CHF patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The gut-lung axis in severe acute Pancreatitis-associated lung injury: The protection by the gut microbiota through short-chain fatty acids</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35752356/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of gut microbiota in regulating the intestinal homeostasis, as well as the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury (PALI) is widely recognized. The bioactive functions of metabolites with small molecule weight and the detail molecular mechanisms of PALI mediated by &amp;ldquo;gut-lung axis&amp;rdquo; have gradually raised the attentions of researchers. Several studies have proved that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbiome play crucial roles and varied activities in the process of PALI. However, relevant reviews reporting SCFAs in the involvement of PALI is lacking. In this review, we firstly introduced the synthetic and metabolic pathways of SCFAs, as well as the transport and signal transduction routes in brief. Afterwards, we focused on the possible mechanisms and clues of SCFAs to participate in the fight against PALI which referred to the inhibition of pathogen proliferation, anti-inflammatory effects, enhancement of intestinal barrier functions, and the maintenance and regulation of immune homeostasis via pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In addition, the latest reported pathological and physiological mechanisms of the gut-lung axis involved in PALI were reviewed. Finally, we summarized the potential therapeutic interventions of PALI by targeting SCFAs, including dietary fiber supplementation, direct supplementation of SCFAs/prebiotics/probiotics, and drugs administration, which is expected to provide new sights for clinical use in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypomagnesemia, Hypocalcemia, and Tubulointerstitial Nephropathy Caused by Claudin-16 Autoantibodies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35728884/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic hypomagnesemia is commonly due to diarrhea, alcoholism, and drugs. More rarely, it is caused by genetic defects in the effectors of renal magnesium reabsorption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In an adult patient with acquired severe hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, tubulointerstitial nephropathy, and rapidly progressing kidney injury, similarities between the patient&amp;rsquo;s presentation and features of genetic disorders of renal magnesium transport prompted us to investigate whether the patient had an acquired autoimmune cause of renal magnesium wasting. To determine if the patient&amp;rsquo;s condition might be explained by autoantibodies directed against claudin-16 or claudin-19, transmembrane paracellular proteins involved in renal magnesium absorption, we conducted experiments with claudin knockout mice and transfected mouse kidney cells expressing human claudin-16 or claudin-19. We also examined effects on renal magnesium handling in rats given intravenous injections of IgG purified from sera from the patient or controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Experiments with the knockout mice and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; transfected cells demonstrated that hypomagnesemia in the patient was causally linked to autoantibodies directed against claudin-16, which controls paracellular magnesium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle&amp;rsquo;s loop. Intravenous injection of IgG purified from the patient&amp;rsquo;s serum induced a marked urinary waste of magnesium in rats. Immunosuppressive treatment combining plasma exchange and rituximab was associated with improvement in the patient&amp;rsquo;s GFR, but hypomagnesemia persisted. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with a renal carcinoma that expressed a high level of claudin-16 mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Pathogenic claudin-16 autoantibodies represent a novel autoimmune cause of specific renal tubular transport disturbances and tubulointerstitial nephropathy. Screening for autoantibodies targeting claudin-16, and potentially other magnesium transporters or channels in the kidney, may be warranted in patients with acquired unexplained hypomagnesemia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 conferred potent protection against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 inhibited M1 macrophage polarization, limiting its pro-inflammatory activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 suppressed NF-κB and STAT1 signaling by targeting IKKβ as well as STAT1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACT001 has been shown to exhibit excellent antitumor and anti-fibrosis activities. However, the role of ACT001 in acute lung injury (ALI) and the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of ACT001 on ALI and explore the potential mechanisms. Herein, we firstly established the ALI mouse model induced by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ACT001 treatment significantly alleviated histopathological changes of lung tissues with lower infiltration of pulmonary M1 macrophages in ALI mice. Then, we performed in vitro experiment and found that ACT001 treatment effectively inhibited the M1 phenotype of RAW264.7 and THP-1.. Next, we performed pull-down and mass spectrometry analysis to screen the interacting proteins of ACT001, identifying IKKβ and STAT1 as the critical target proteins of ACT001. And ACT001 treatment significantly suppressed the NF-κB and STAT1 pathways, thereby inhibiting the M1 polarization against inflammation in vivo and in vitro. Finally, we used IMD 0354 (IMD) and Fludarabine (Flud) to specifically block the activity of IKKβ and STAT1, and stimulated macrophages through IKKβ and STAT1 overexpression. Our data clearly showed that ACT001-induced decrease of the M1 polarization was blocked by IMD and Flud treatment, and reversed by IKKβ and STAT1 overexpression in RAW264.7 cells. In conclusion, we discovered that ACT001 significantly alleviates inflammation and limits M1 phenotype of pulmonary macrophages via suppressing NF-κB and STAT1 signaling pathways, providing new insights for the development of drugs to treat ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ROS-responsive polymer nanoparticles with enhanced loading of dexamethasone effectively modulate the lung injury microenvironment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disorder associated with cytokine storm, which activates various reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathways and causes severe complications in patients as currently seen in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is an urgent need for medication of the inflammatory lung environment and effective delivery of drugs to lung to reduce the burden of high doses of medications and attenuate inflammatory cells and pathways. Herein, we prepared dexamethasone-loaded ROS-responsive polymer nanoparticles (PFTU@DEX NPs) by a modified emulsion approach, which achieved high loading content of DEX (11.61 %). DEX was released faster from the PFTU@DEX NPs in a ROS environment, which could scavenge excessive ROS efficiently both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. The PFTU NPs and PFTU@DEX NPs showed no hemolysis and cytotoxicity. Free DEX, PFTU NPs and PFTU@DEX NPs shifted M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages in RAW264.7 cells, and showed anti-inflammatory modulation to A549 cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. The PFTU@DEX NPs treatment significantly reduced the increased total protein concentration in BALF of ALI mice. The delivery of PFTU@DEX NPs decreased the proportion of neutrophils significantly, mitigated the cell apoptosis remarkably compared to the other groups, reduced M1 macrophages and increased M2 macrophages &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Moreover, the PFTU@DEX NPs had the strongest ability to suppress the expression of NLRP3, Caspase1, and IL-1β. Therefore, the PFTU@DEX NPs could efficiently suppress inflammatory cells, ROS signaling pathways, and cell apoptosis to ameliorate LPS-induced ALI. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disorder associated with cytokine storm, which activates various reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathways and causes severe complications in patients. There is an urgent need for medication of the inflammatory lung environment and effective delivery of drugs to modulate the inflammatory disorder and suppress the expression of ROS and inflammatory cytokines. The inhaled PFTU@DEX NPs prepared through a modified nanoemulsification method suppressed the activation of NLRP3, induced the polarization of macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2, and thereby reduced the neutrophil infiltration, inhibited the release of proteins and inflammatory mediators, and thus decreased the acute lung injury &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High phosphate-induced progressive proximal tubular injury is associated with the activation of Stat3/Kim-1 signaling pathway and macrophage recruitment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary phosphate intake in the Western population greatly exceeds the recommended dietary allowance and is linked to enhanced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It is unclear whether a chronic high phosphate diet (HPD) causes kidney injury in healthy individuals. Here, we show that feeding a 2% HPD in C57BL/6N mice for one up to six months resulted in hyperphosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia, increased plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) compared to mice on a 0.8% phosphate diet. Kidney injury was already noted after two months of HPD characterized by loss of proximal tubular (PT) cell polarity, flattened epithelia, disruption of brush border membranes, vacuolization, increased PT cell proliferation, marked interstitial mononuclear infiltration, and progressive accumulation of collagen fibers. HPD increased Stat3 activation and Kim-1 expression in PT epithelial cells and enhanced renal synthesis of chemokines recruiting monocytes and macrophages as well as macrophage related factors. Enhanced recruitment of F4/80+ macrophages around injured PT lesions was timely associated with increased Kim-1 synthesis, tubular MCP-1 expression, and degree of PT injury score. Likewise, tubulointerstitial fibrosis was associated with activation of Stat3/Kim-1 signaling pathway. The stimulation of human proximal tubular cells with high phosphate activated Stat3 signaling and induced HAVCR1 and CCL2 expression. We conclude that high phosphate results in progressive proximal tubular injury, indicating that high dietary phosphate intake may affect kidney health and therefore represents an underestimated health problem for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>B7-1 mediates podocyte injury and glomerulosclerosis through communication with Hsp90ab1-LRP5-β-catenin pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35710882/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podocyte injury is a hallmark of glomerular diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. B7-1 is increased in injured podocytes, but its intrinsic role is controversial. The clinical data here revealed the intimate correlation of urinary B7-1 with severity of glomerular injury. Through transcriptomic and biological assays in B7-1 transgenic and adriamycin nephropathy models, we identified B7-1 is a key mediator in podocyte injury and glomerulosclerosis through a series of signal transmission to β-catenin. Using LC-MS/MS, Hsp90ab1, a conserved molecular chaperone, was distinguished to be an anchor for transmitting signals from B7-1 to β-catenin. Molecular docking and subsequent mutant analysis further identified the residue K69 in the N terminal domain of Hsp90ab1 was the key binding site for B7-1 to activate LRP5/β-catenin pathway. The interaction and biological functions of B7-1-Hsp90ab1-LRP5 complex were further demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. We also found B7-1 is a novel downstream target of β-catenin. Our results indicate an intercrossed network of B7-1, which collectively induces podocyte injury and glomerulosclerosis. Our study provides an important clue to improve the therapeutic strategies to target B7-1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dynamic Chromatin States Coupling with Key Transcription Factors in Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is one of the critical risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanisms for transition from colitis to CRC remain elusive. Recently, epigenetic changes have emerged as important regulatory factors for colitis-associated cancer. Here, a systematic epigenomic study of histone modifications is performed, including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, in an AOM-DSS-induced CRC mouse model. In combination with transcriptomic data, the authors generate a dataset of 105 deep sequencing files and illustrate the dynamic landscape of chromatin states at five time points during inflammation-cancer transition. Functional gene clusters are identified based on dynamic transcriptomic and epigenomic information, and key signaling pathways in the process are illustrated. This study&amp;rsquo;s results reveal that enhancer state regions play important roles during inflammation-cancer transition. It predicts novel transcription factors based on enhancer information, and experimentally proves OTX2 as a critical tumor suppressive transcription factor. Taken together, this study provides comprehensive epigenomic data and reveals novel molecular mechanisms for colitis-associated cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genetic loci and prioritization of genes for kidney function decline derived from a meta-analysis of 62 longitudinal genome-wide association studies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35716955/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reflects kidney function. Progressive eGFR-decline can lead to kidney failure, necessitating dialysis or transplantation. Hundreds of loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for eGFR help explain population cross section variability. Since the contribution of these or other loci to eGFR-decline remains largely unknown, we derived GWAS for annual eGFR-decline and meta-analyzed 62 longitudinal studies with eGFR assessed twice over time in all 343,339 individuals and in high-risk groups. We also explored different covariate adjustment. Twelve genome-wide significant independent variants for eGFR-decline unadjusted or adjusted for eGFR-baseline (11 novel, one known for this phenotype), including nine variants robustly associated across models were identified. All loci for eGFR-decline were known for cross-sectional eGFR and thus distinguished a subgroup of eGFR loci. Seven of the nine variants showed variant-by-age interaction on eGFR cross section (further about 350,000 individuals), which linked genetic associations for eGFR-decline with age-dependency of genetic cross-section associations. Clinically important were two to four-fold greater genetic effects on eGFR-decline in high-risk subgroups. Five variants associated also with chronic kidney disease progression mapped to genes with functional in-silico evidence (UMOD, SPATA7, GALNTL5, TPPP). An unfavorable versus favorable nine-variant genetic profile showed increased risk odds ratios of 1.35 for kidney failure (95% confidence intervals 1.03-1.77) and 1.27 for acute kidney injury (95% confidence intervals 1.08-1.50) in over 2000 cases each, with matched controls). Thus, we provide a large data resource, genetic loci, and prioritized genes for kidney function decline, which help inform drug development pipelines revealing important insights into the age-dependency of kidney function genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Methyltransferase-like 3 leads to lung injury by up-regulation of interleukin 24 through N6-methyladenosine-dependent mRNA stability and translation efficiency in mice exposed to fine particulate matter 2.5</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35718042/</link>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-term fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) exposure induces lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 increases the global RNA m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 alters the expression of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modulators including METTL3 and YTHDF1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YTHDF1 can bind &lt;em&gt;IL24&lt;/em&gt; mRNA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;METTL3 and YTHDF1 regulate the expression of IL24 via m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) exposure leads to the progress of pulmonary disease. It has been reported that N6-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) modification was involved in various biological processes and diseases. However, the critical role of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification in pulmonary disease during PM2.5 exposure remains elusive. Here, we revealed that lung inflammation and mucus production caused by PM2.5 were associated with m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification. Both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; assays demonstrated that PM2.5 exposure elevated the total level of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification as well as the methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) expression. Integration analysis of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A RNA immunoprecipitation-seq (meRIP-seq) and RNA-seq discovered that METTL3 up-regulated the expression level and the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification of Interleukin 24 (IL24). Importantly, we explored that the stability of &lt;em&gt;IL24&lt;/em&gt; mRNA was enhanced due to the increased m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification. Moreover, the data from qRT-PCR showed that PM2.5 also increased &lt;em&gt;YTH&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-Methyladenosine RNA Binding Protein 1&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;YTHDF1&lt;/em&gt;) expression, and the up-regulated YTHDF1 augmented &lt;em&gt;IL24&lt;/em&gt; mRNA translation efficiency. Down-regulation of Mettl3 reduced Il24 expression and ameliorated the pulmonary inflammation and mucus secretion in mice exposed to PM2.5. Taken together, our finding provided a comprehensive insight for revealing the significant role of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A regulators in the lung injury via METTL3/YTHDF1-coupled epitranscriptomal regulation of &lt;em&gt;IL24&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Whole transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed key RNA profiles and toxicity in mice after chronic exposure to microplastics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating the long-term effects of microplastics (MPs) in vivo is necessary for evaluating its biological toxicity. Previously, we showed that MPs elicit vascular dysfunctions in atherosclerotic mice. However, the effects of long-term treatment with environmental levels of MPs on biological functions and RNA expression profiles in wild-type mice are unknown. Here, C57BL/6 mice were administered 1000 μg/L MPs through their drinking water for 180 days. Transcriptomic analyses, biochemical analysis, and histopathological examination were conducted to determine the key signals and molecular mechanisms triggered by MPs in vivo using whole transcriptome sequencing, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and histopathological analysis. Notably, our data revealed that MPs aggravated vascular lesions and organ injuries, particularly liver, kidney, and heart injuries. Additionally, MPs exacerbated oxidative injuries by inhibiting the activities of antioxidant enzymes and increasing the levels of the serum biochemistry indicator of organ damage. RNA sequencing of vascular tissues showed that 674 mRNAs, 39 lncRNAs, 196 miRNAs, and 565 circRNAs were abnormally expressed in MPs-treated mice compared with the untreated group. Pathway enrichment analyses identified pathways linked to the toxicity of MPs, including lysosomal, NOD-like receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathways. Additionally, competing endogenous RNA networks were constructed and hub RNAs were identified using bioinformatics analysis. Taken together, our data suggested that toxicity induced by long-term exposure to MPs continually presents with extensive changes in biological features and global gene expression profiles. Our data provides new insights into the biological toxicity of MPs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening lung injury characterized by an acute inflammatory response in the lung parenchyma. Hence, it is considered as the most appropriate clinical syndrome to study pathogenic mechanisms of lung inflammation. ARDS is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU), while no effective pharmacological treatment exists. It is very important therefore to fully characterize the underlying pathobiology and the related mechanisms, in order to develop novel therapeutic approaches. In vivo and in vitro models are important pre-clinical tools in biological and medical research in the mechanistic and pathological understanding of the majority of diseases. In this review, we will present data from selected experimental models of lung injury/acute lung inflammation, which have been based on clinical disorders that can lead to the development of ARDS and related inflammatory lung processes in humans, including ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI), sepsis, ischemia/reperfusion, smoke, acid aspiration, radiation, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), influenza, &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;S.&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; and coronaviruses infection. Data from the corresponding clinical conditions will also be presented. The mechanisms related to lung inflammation that will be covered are oxidative stress, neutrophil extracellular traps, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, surfactant, and water and ion channels. Finally, we will present a brief overview of emerging techniques in the field of omics research that have been applied to ARDS research, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, which may recognize factors to help stratify ICU patients at risk, predict their prognosis, and possibly, serve as more specific therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberrant pro-inflammatory activation of Kupffer cells (KCs) is strongly involved in the pathogenesis of septic liver injury. Recent evidence indicates the crucial roles of excessive stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling activation during sepsis. However, the role of STING signaling in septic liver injury remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that STING signaling was markedly activated in KCs isolated from wild type mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. STING deficiency effectively protected liver function, attenuated systemic inflammatory response and decreased mortality in LPS-treated mice, which were aggravated by STING agonist (DMXAA). Importantly, STING signaling activation in KCs contributed to LPS-induced liver injury through promoting hepatocyte death. Mechanistically, STING signaling could be activated by release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) through dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-dependent mitochondrial fission in LPS-treated KCs. Additionally, LPS stimulation enhanced DRP1-dependent mitochondrial ROS production, which promoted the leak of mtDNA into the cytosol and subsequent STING signaling activation in KCs. The in vivo experiments showed that pharmacological inhibition of DRP1 with Mdivi-1 partially prevented the activation of STING signaling in KCs isolated from LPS-challenged mice, as well as alleviated liver injury and inhibited systemic inflammatory response. In summary, our study comprehensively confirmed that STING signaling senses the DRP1-dependent release of mtDNA in KCs and its activation might play a key role in LPS-induced liver injury, which offers new sights and therapeutic targets for management of septic liver injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brevilin A Ameliorates Acute Lung Injury and Inflammation Through Inhibition of NF-κB Signaling via Targeting IKKα/β</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35774606/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is life-threatening disease characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory response. IKKα/β, the key kinases in the activation of NF-κB pathway, are implicated in inflammatory pulmonary injury, and represent attractive targets for ALI therapy. Brevilin A (BVA) is a sesquiterpene lactone from Centipeda minima, a Chinese herb used to treat inflammatory diseases. This study aims to investigate the inhibition of BVA on ALI, with focus on clarifying the molecular mechanisms involved in BVA-mediated anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages. Briefly, BVA significantly inhibited the production of NO and PGE2 by suppressing iNOS and COX2 expression, and suppressed the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα in LPS/IFNγ-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. The anti-inflammatory activity of BVA was further confirmed in LPS/IFNγ-stimulated BMDMs and TNFα/IFNγ-exposed RAW264.7 cells. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, BVA effectively attenuated LPS-induced lung damage, inflammatory infiltration, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including MPO, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and PGE2. Mechanistically, BVA could covalently bind to the cysteine 114 of IKKα/β, and effectively inhibiting the activity and function of IKKα/β, thereby resulting in the suppression of phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and the subsequent activation of NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, pretreatment of DTT, a thiol ligand donor, significantly abolished BVA-mediated effects in LPS/IFNγ-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, suggesting the crucial role of the electrophilic α, β-unsaturated ketone of BVA on its anti-inflammatory activity. These results suggest that BVA ameliorates ALI through inhibition of NF-κB signaling via covalently targeting IKKα/β, raising the possibility that BVA could be effective in the treatment of ALI and other diseases harboring aberrant NF-κB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impaired Antibody Response Is Associated with Histone-Release, Organ Dysfunction and Mortality in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35743491/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; the pathophysiologic mechanisms explaining differences in clinical outcomes following COVID-19 are not completely described. This study aims to investigate antibody responses in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in relation to inflammation, organ failure and 30-day survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; All patients with PCR-verified COVID-19 and gave consent, and who were admitted to a tertiary Intensive care unit (ICU) in Sweden during March-September 2020 were included. Demography, repeated blood samples and measures of organ function were collected. Analyses of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM, IgA and IgG) in plasma were performed and correlated to patient outcome and biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 115 patients (median age 62 years, 77% male) were included prospectively. All patients developed severe respiratory dysfunction, and 59% were treated with invasive ventilation. Thirty-day mortality was 22.6% for all included patients. Patients negative for any anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in plasma during ICU admission had higher 30-day mortality compared to patients positive for antibodies. Patients positive for IgM had more ICU-, ventilator-, renal replacement therapy- and vasoactive medication-free days. IgA antibody concentrations correlated negatively with both SAPS3 and maximal SOFA-score and IgM-levels correlated negatively with SAPS3. Patients with antibody levels below the detection limit had higher plasma levels of extracellular histones on day 1 and elevated levels of kidney and cardiac biomarkers, but showed no signs of increased inflammation, complement activation or cytokine release. After adjusting for age, positive IgM and IgG antibodies were still associated with increased 30-day survival, with odds ratio (OR) 7.1 (1.5-34.4) and 4.2 (1.1-15.7), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In patients with severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care, a poor antibody response is associated with organ failure, systemic histone release and increased 30-day mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal Microbiota - An Unmissable Bridge to Severe Acute Pancreatitis-Associated Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35774796/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), one of the most serious abdominal emergencies in general surgery, is characterized by acute and rapid onset as well as high mortality, which often leads to multiple organ failure (MOF). Acute lung injury (ALI), the earliest accompanied organ dysfunction, is the most common cause of death in patients following the SAP onset. The exact pathogenesis of ALI during SAP, however, remains unclear. In recent years, advances in the microbiota-gut-lung axis have led to a better understanding of SAP-associated lung injury (PALI). In addition, the bidirectional communications between intestinal microbes and the lung are becoming more apparent. This paper aims to review the mechanisms of an imbalanced intestinal microbiota contributing to the development of PALI, which is mediated by the disruption of physical, chemical, and immune barriers in the intestine, promotes bacterial translocation, and results in the activation of abnormal immune responses in severe pancreatitis. The pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) mediated immunol mechanisms in the occurrence of PALI via binding with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) through the microbiota-gut-lung axis are focused in this study. Moreover, the potential therapeutic strategies for alleviating PALI by regulating the composition or the function of the intestinal microbiota are discussed in this review. The aim of this study is to provide new ideas and therapeutic tools for PALI patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RG100204, A Novel Aquaporin-9 Inhibitor, Reduces Septic Cardiomyopathy and Multiple Organ Failure in Murine Sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35774785/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is caused by systemic infection and is a major health concern as it is the primary cause of death from infection. It is the leading cause of mortality worldwide and there are no specific effective treatments for sepsis. Gene deletion of the neutral solute channel Aquaporin 9 (AQP9) normalizes oxidative stress and improves survival in a bacterial endotoxin induced mouse model of sepsis. In this study we described the initial characterization and effects of a novel small molecule AQP9 inhibitor, RG100204, in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) induced model of polymicrobial infection. In vitro, RG100204 blocked mouse AQP9 H2O2 permeability in an ectopic CHO cell expression system and abolished the LPS induced increase in superoxide anion and nitric oxide in FaO hepatoma cells. Pre-treatment of CLP-mice with RG100204 (25 mg/kg p.o. before CLP and then again at 8 h after CLP) attenuated the hypothermia, cardiac dysfunction (systolic and diastolic), renal dysfunction and hepatocellular injury caused by CLP-induced sepsis. Post-treatment of CLP-mice with RG100204 also attenuated the cardiac dysfunction (systolic and diastolic), the renal dysfunction caused by CLP-induced sepsis, but did not significantly reduce the liver injury or hypothermia. The most striking finding was that oral administration of RG100204 as late as 3 h after the onset of polymicrobial sepsis attenuated the cardiac and renal dysfunction caused by severe sepsis. Immunoblot quantification demonstrated that RG100204 reduced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Moreover, myeloperoxidase activity in RG100204 treated lung tissue was reduced. Together these results indicate that AQP9 may be a novel drug target in polymicrobial sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatiotemporal distribution of cellular injury and leukocytes during the progression of ventilator-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35700201/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supportive mechanical ventilation is a necessary lifesaving treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This intervention often leads to injury exacerbation by ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Patterns of injury in ARDS and VILI are recognized to be heterogeneous; however, quantification of these injury distributions remains incomplete. Developing a more detailed understanding of injury heterogeneity, particularly how it varies in space and time, can help elucidate the mechanisms of VILI pathogenesis. Ultimately, this knowledge can be used to develop protective ventilation strategies that slow disease progression. To expand existing knowledge of VILI heterogeneity, we document the spatial evolution of cellular injury distribution and leukocyte infiltration, on the micro- and macroscales, during protective and injurious mechanical ventilation. We ventilated naïve mice using either high inspiratory pressure and zero positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation or low tidal volume with positive end-expiratory pressure. Distributions of cellular injury, identified with propidium iodide staining, were microscopically analyzed at three levels of injury severity. Cellular injury initiated in diffuse, quasi-random patterns, and progressed through expansion of high-density regions of injured cells termed &amp;ldquo;injury clusters.&amp;rdquo; The density profile of the expanding injury regions suggests that stress shielding occurs, protecting the already injured regions from further damage. Spatial distribution of leukocytes did not correlate with that of cellular injury or ventilation-induced changes in lung function. These results suggest that protective ventilation protocols should protect the interface between healthy and injured regions to stymie injury propagation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The circular RNA hsa_circ_0003091 regulates sepsis-induced lung injury by sponging the miR-149/Smad2 axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe cause of death. Increasing evidence has identified circular RNAs (circRNAs) acting as critical regulators of human diseases. However, their expression pattern and underlying mechanisms in ALI remain unclear. Herein, we screened the circRNAs of ALI patients and constructed a lung injury murine model using lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induction. Functional analyses of targeted circRNA were performed &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Then, the downstream miRNA and mRNA of specific circRNAs were identified. Compared to healthy subjects, 35 circRNAs were upregulated and 9 circRNAs were downregulated in sepsis patients. The top 10 differentially expressed circRNAs were selected for validation and has_circ_0003091 was selected. The ALI mice presented significantly elevated has_circ_0003091 (mmu_circ_0015268). The functional analysis revealed that mmu_circ_0015268 contributed to the pulmonary injury, cell apoptosis, inflammatory responses, and endothelial activation in the ALI murine model. On the other hand, silencing mmu_circ_0015268 showed protective effects in LPS-treated mice and PMVECs. Furthermore, mmu_circ_0015268 sponged miR-149 to upregulate the expression of its target Smad2. In summary, we demonstrated that has_circ_0003091 might be a novel target for the management and treatment of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fatal Circle of NETs and NET-Associated DAMPs Contributing to Organ Dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35741047/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens or sterile injuries. Pattern recognition receptors (PRR) sense molecules released from inflamed or damaged cells, or foreign molecules resulting from invading pathogens. PRRs can in turn induce inflammatory responses, comprising the generation of cytokines or chemokines, which further induce immune cell recruitment. Neutrophils represent an essential factor in the early immune response and fulfill numerous tasks to fight infection or heal injuries. The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is part of it and was originally attributed to the capture and elimination of pathogens. In the last decade studies revealed a detrimental role of NETs during several diseases, often correlated with an exaggerated immune response. Overwhelming inflammation in single organs can induce remote organ damage, thereby further perpetuating release of inflammatory molecules. Here, we review recent findings regarding damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which are able to induce NET formation, as well as NET components known to act as DAMPs, generating a putative fatal circle of inflammation contributing to organ damage and sequentially occurring remote organ injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Characterization of the B-Cell Epitopes of Echinococcus granulosus Histones H4 and H2A Recognized by Sera From Patients With Liver Cysts</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35770070/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic disease worldwide distributed, caused by the cestode &lt;em&gt;Echinococcus granulosus&lt;/em&gt; sensu lato (&lt;em&gt;E. granulosus&lt;/em&gt;), with an incidence rate of 50/100,000 person/year and a high prevalence in humans of 5-10%. Serology has variable sensitivity and specificity and low predictive values. Antigens used are from the hydatid fluid and recombinant antigens have not demonstrated superiority over hydatid fluid. A cell line called EGPE was obtained from &lt;em&gt;E. granulosus&lt;/em&gt; sensu lato G1 strain from bovine liver. Serum from CE patients recognizes protein extracts from EGPE cells with higher sensitivity than protein extracts from hydatid fluid. In the present study, EGPE cell protein extracts and supernatants from cell colonies were eluted from a protein G affinity column performed with sera from 11 CE patients. LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of the eluted proteins identified four &lt;em&gt;E. granulosus&lt;/em&gt; histones: one histone H4 in the cell extract and supernatant, one histone H2A only in the cell extract, and two histones H2A only in the supernatant. This differential distribution of histones could reflect different parasite viability stages regarding their role in gene transcription and silencing and could interact with host cells. Bioinformatics tools characterized the linear and conformational epitopes involved in antibody recognition. The three-dimensional structure of each histone was obtained by molecular modeling and validated by molecular dynamics simulation and PCR confirmed the presence of the epitopes in the parasite genome. The three histones H2A were very different and had a less conserved sequence than the histone H4. Comparison of the histones of &lt;em&gt;E. granulosus&lt;/em&gt; with those of other organisms showed exclusive regions for &lt;em&gt;E. granulosus&lt;/em&gt;. Since histones play a role in the host-parasite relationship they could be good candidates to improve the predictive value of serology in CE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fyn-kinase and caveolin-1 in the alveolar epithelial junctional adherence complex contribute to the early stages of pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35710078/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current pathophysiological findings indicate that damage to the alveolar epithelium plays a decisive role in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The available pharmacological interventions (i.e., oral pirfenidone and nintedanib) only slow down progression of the disease, but do not offer a cure. In order to develop new drug candidates, the pathophysiology of IPF needs to be better understood on a molecular level. It has previously been reported that a loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) contributes to profibrotic processes by causing reduced alveolar barrier function and fibrosis-like alterations of the lung-parenchyma. Conversely, overexpression of caveolin-1 appears to counteract the development of fibrosis by inhibiting the inflammasome NLRP3 and the associated expression of interleukin-1β. In this study, the interaction between Fyn-kinase and caveolin-1 in the alveolar epithelium of various bleomycin (BLM)/TGF-β damage models using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS), wildtype (WT) and caveolin-1 knockout (KO) mice as well as the human NCI-H441 cell line, were investigated. In WT mouse lung tissues, strong signals for Fyn-kinase were detected in alveolar epithelial type I cells, whereas in caveolin-1 KO animals, expression shifted to alveolar epithelial type II cells. Caveolin-1 and Fyn-kinase were found to be co-localized in isolated lipid rafts of NCI-H441 cell membrane fractions. These findings were corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation studies in which a co-localization of Cav-1 and Fyn-kinase was detected in the cell membrane of the alveolar epithelium. After TGF-β and BLM-induced damage to the alveolar epithelium both in PCLS and cell culture experiments, a decrease in caveolin-1 and Fyn-kinase was found. Furthermore, TEER (transepithelial electrical resistance) measurements indicated that TGF-β and BLM have a damaging effect on cell-cell contacts and thus impair the barrier function in NCI-H441 cell monolayers. This effect was attenuated after co-incubation with the Fyn-kinase inhibitor, PP-2. Our data suggest an involvement of Fyn-kinase and caveolin-1 in TGF-β/bleomycin-induced impairment of alveolar barrier function and thus a possible role in the early stages of pulmonary fibrosis. Fyn-kinase and/or its complex with caveolin-1 might, therefore, be novel therapeutic targets in IPF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spinal Cord Injury Impairs Lung Immunity in Mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after spinal cord injury (SCI). Although SCI causes atrophy and dysfunction in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues with a corresponding decrease in the number and function of circulating leukocytes, it is unknown whether this SCI-dependent systemic immune suppression also affects the unique tissue-specific antimicrobial defense mechanisms that protect the lung. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that SCI directly impairs pulmonary immunity and subsequently increases the risk for developing pneumonia. Using mouse models of severe high-level SCI, we find that recruitment of circulating leukocytes and transcriptional control of immune signaling in the lung is impaired after SCI, creating an environment that is permissive for infection. Specifically, we saw a sustained loss of pulmonary leukocytes, a loss of alveolar macrophages at chronic time points postinjury, and a decrease in immune modulatory genes, especially cytokines, needed to eliminate pulmonary infections. Importantly, this injury-dependent impairment of pulmonary antimicrobial defense is only partially overcome by boosting the recruitment of immune cells to the lung with the drug AMD3100, a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that mobilizes leukocytes and hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow. Collectively, these data indicate that the immune-suppressive effects of SCI extend to the lung, a unique site of mucosal immunity. Furthermore, preventing lung infection after SCI will likely require novel strategies, beyond the use of orthodox antibiotics, to reverse or block tissue-specific cellular and molecular determinants of pulmonary immune surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Impact of Zinc Supplementation on Critically Ill Patients With Acute Kidney Injury: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35769374/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35769374/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Zinc is an essential trace element involved in multiple metabolic processes. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with low plasma zinc, but outcomes with zinc supplementation in critically ill patients with AKI remain unknown. Our objective was to investigate the effectiveness of zinc supplementation in this patient population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Critically ill patients with AKI were identified from the Medical Informative Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Prosperity score matching (PSM) was applied to match patients receiving zinc treatment to those without zinc treatment. The association between zinc sulfate use and in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), and length of stay was determined by logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 9,811 AKI patients were included in the study. PSM yielded 222 pairs of patients who received zinc treatment and those who did not. Zinc supplementation was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (HR = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.83) &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009) and 30-day mortality (HR = 0.51 (95% CI, 0.30, 0.86) &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012). In the subgroup analysis, zinc use was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in patients with stage 1 AKI and those with sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Zinc supplementation was associated with improved survival in critically ill patients with AKI. The supplementation was especially effective in those with stage 1 AKI and sepsis. These results need to be verified in randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influence of respiratory loading on left-ventricular function in cervical spinal cord injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35751465/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cervical spinal cord injury (C-SCI) negatively impacts cardiac and respiratory function. As the heart and lungs are linked via the pulmonary circuit these systems are interdependent. Here, we utilized inspiratory and expiratory loading to assess whether augmenting the respiratory pump improves left-ventricular (LV) filling and output in individuals with motor-complete C-SCI. We hypothesized LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) would increase and decrease with inspiratory and expiratory loading, respectively. Participants (C-SCI: 7M/1F, 35 ± 7 years; able-bodied: 7M/1F, 32 ± 6 years) were assessed under five conditions during 45° head-up tilt; unloaded, inspiratory loading with -10 and -20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oesophageal pressure (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;oes&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) on inspiration, and expiratory loading with +10 and +20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;oes&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on expiration. An oesophageal balloon catheter monitored &lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;oes&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; , and LV structure and function were assessed by echocardiography. In C-SCI only, (1) +20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O reduced LVEDV vs. unloaded (81 ± 15 vs. 88 ± 11 ml, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.006); (2) heart rate was higher during +20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O compared to unloaded (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001) and +10 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002); (3) cardiac output was higher during +20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O than unloaded (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002); and (4) end-expiratory lung volume was higher during +20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O vs. unloaded (63 ± 10 vs. 55 ± 13% total lung capacity, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003) but was unaffected by inspiratory loading. In both groups, -10 and -20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O had no significant effect on LVEDV. These findings suggest greater expiratory positive pressure acutely impairs LV filling in C-SCI, potentially via impaired venous return, mediastinal constraint and/or direct ventricular interaction subsequent to dynamic hyperinflation. Inspiratory loading did not significantly improve LV function in C-SCI and neither inspiratory nor expiratory loading affected cardiac function or lung volumes in able-bodied participants. KEY POINTS: Cervical spinal cord injury (C-SCI) alters both the cardiac and the respiratory system, but little is known about how these systems interact following injury. Here, we manipulated inspiratory or expiratory intrathoracic pressure (ITP) to mechanistically test the role of the respiratory pump in circulatory function in highly trained individuals with C-SCI and an able-bodied reference group. In individuals with C-SCI, greater ITP during expiratory loading caused dynamic hyperinflation that was associated with impaired left-ventricular filling. More negative ITP during inspiratory loading did not significantly alter left-ventricular volumes in either group. Interventions that prevent dynamic hyperinflation and/or enhance the ability to generate expiratory pressures may help preserve left-ventricular filling in individuals with C-SCI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel inhalable quercetin-alginate nanogel as a promising therapy for acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35690763/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI), a severe health-threatening disease, has a risk of causing chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Informative and powerful evidence suggests that inflammation and oxidative stress play a central role in the pathogenesis of ALI. Quercetin is well recognized for its excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which showed great potential for ALI treatment. However, the application of quercetin is often hindered by its low solubility and bioavailability. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, an inhalable quercetin-alginate nanogel (QU-Nanogel) was fabricated, and by this special &amp;ldquo;material-drug&amp;rdquo; structure, the solubility and bioavailability of quercetin were significantly enhanced, which could further increase the activity of quercetin and provide a promising therapy for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; QU-Nanogel is a novel alginate and quercetin based &amp;ldquo;material-drug&amp;rdquo; structural inhalable nanogel, in which quercetin was stabilized by hydrogen bonding to obtain a &amp;ldquo;co-construct&amp;rdquo; water-soluble nanogel system, showing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. QU-Nanogel has an even distribution in size of less than 100 nm and good biocompatibility, which shows a stronger protective and antioxidant effect in vitro. Tissue distribution results provided evidence that the QU-Nanogel by ultrasonic aerosol inhalation is a feasible approach to targeted pulmonary drug delivery. Moreover, QU-Nanogel was remarkably reversed ALI rats by relieving oxidative stress damage and acting the down-regulation effects of mRNA and protein expression of inflammation cytokines via ultrasonic aerosol inhalation administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In the ALI rat model, this novel nanogel showed an excellent therapeutic effect by ultrasonic aerosol inhalation administration by protecting and reducing pulmonary inflammation, thereby preventing subsequent pulmonary fibrosis. This work demonstrates that this inhalable QU-Nanogel may function as a promising drug delivery strategy in treating ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RP105 protects against ischemic and septic acute kidney injury via suppressing TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35696803/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35696803/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RP105 is a member of the TLR family and its expression plays a role in cardiovascular disease but the therapeutic impact on acute kidney injury remained unclear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have uncovered evidence that RP105 expression in proximal tubular cells plays a kidney protective role during ischemic and septic acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RP105 reduces tubular cell death, NF-κB activation and inflammatory response during AKI with a mechanism involving interaction with TLR4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This finding may have clinical translation as kidney protection and inflammation regulation could be achieved through RP105 gene therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical and severe clinical disease caused by a variety of factors. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in pathogenesis of AKI. Radioprotective 105 kDa protein (RP105) is a member of the TLR family, but the role of RP105 in AKI is unknown. In this study, we overexpressed RP105 in renal tissue and cultured proximal tubular cells in which we then induced ischemic and septic AKI. Renal structure injuries were examined by hematoxylin eosin staining, while renal function was assessed by measuring serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (SCr) levels. The TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis induced changes in the expression of RP105, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in renal tissue detected by Western blot. Inflammatory cytokines including iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The inflammatory indicators, F4/80 and MPO, were identified by IHC staining. The results showed that expression of the TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway was enhanced in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and septic renal injury, and that overexpression of RP105 in renal tissue alleviated ischemic and septic AKI. Moreover, RP105 gene delivery was associated with reduced renal inflammatory cells infiltration and inflammatory cytokines after AKI. RP105 overexpression also inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-κB after AKI in both in vitro and in vivo, and blunted the interaction between Myeloid Differentiation factor 2 (MD2) and TLR4. These results indicated that RP105 protected against renal ischemic and septic AKI injury by suppressing inflammatory responses mediated by TLR4 signaling pathways. This study suggests that the anti-inflammatory roles of RP105 have potential for preventing and treating renal ischemic and septic AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adoptively Transferred in vitro-Generated Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Improve T-Cell Function and Antigen-Specific Immunity after Traumatic Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35691281/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune reactions after trauma are characterized by immediate activation of innate immunity and simultaneously downregulation of adaptive immunity leading to a misbalanced immunohomeostasis and immunosuppression of the injured host. Therefore, the susceptibility to secondary infections is strongly increased after trauma. Immune responses are regulated by a network of immune cells influencing each other and at the same time modifying their functions dependent on the inflammatory environment. Although myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are initially described as T-cell suppressors, their immunomodulatory capacity after trauma is mostly undefined. Therefore, in vitro-generated MDSCs were adoptively transferred into mice after blunt chest trauma (TxT). A single MDSC treatment-induced splenic T-cell expansion decreased apoptosis sensitivity and improved proliferation in the absence of T-cell exhaustion until 2 weeks after trauma. MDSC treatment had a long-lasting effect on the genomic landscape of CD4+ T cells by upregulating primarily Th2-associated genes. Remarkably, immune-activating functions of MDSCs supported the ability of TxT mice to respond to post-traumatic secondary antigen challenge. Secondary insults were mimicked by immunizing MDSC-treated TxT mice with ovalbumin (OVA), followed by OVA restimulation in vitro. MDSC treatment significantly increased the frequency of OVA-specific T cells, enhanced their Th1/Th2 cytokine expression, and induced upregulation of cytolytic molecules finally improving OVA-specific cytotoxicity. Overall, we could show that therapeutic MDSC treatment after TxT improves post-traumatic T-cell functions, which might enable the traumatic host to counterbalance trauma-induced immunoparalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New mechanism of nephrotoxicity of triptolide: Oxidative stress promotes cGAS-STING signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35697291/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triptolide activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in kidney tubular cells in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STING inhibitor C176 had protective effects in TPL-induced nephrocyte damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triptolide induced an enhancement in protein levels of BACH1, while the expression of HMOX1 was reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oxidative stress-induced mtDNA damage and DNA leakage were the causes of the activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triptolide (TPL) is a bioactive component extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F., and has multiple pharmacological activities, such as anti-tumor activity. However, severe adverse effects and toxicity, especially nephrotoxicity, limit its clinical application. It has been demonstrated that mitochondrial defect is a major toxic effects of TPL. In this study, we show that triptolide activated the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in kidney tubular cells in vivo and in vitro. Renal injury models were established in BALB/c mice and human tubular epithelial cells using TPL. We found that TPL enhanced the phosphorylation levels of STING, TBK1 and IRF3, and upregulated the expression of IFNβ, which is the production of cGAS-STING signaling pathway. STING inhibitor C176 had protective effects in TPL-induced nephrocyte damage. STING siRNA down regulated the expression level of IFNβ. In addition, triptolide induced an increase in protein levels of the transcription factor BACH1, while transcriptional expression of the antioxidant enzyme HMOX1 was reduced due to the increased expression of BACH1. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced mtDNA damage and DNA leakage caused activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Altogether, cGAS-STING signaling pathway involved in TPL induced nephrotoxicity. Inhibiting cGAS-STING over-activation may be a new strategy for alleviating renal injury of triptolide.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human temperature regulation under heat stress in health, disease, and injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human body constantly exchanges heat with the environment. Temperature regulation is a homeostatic feedback control system that ensures deep body temperature is maintained within narrow limits despite wide variations in environmental conditions and activity-related elevations in metabolic heat production. Extensive research has been performed to study the physiological regulation of deep body temperature. This review focuses on healthy and disordered human temperature regulation during heat stress. Central to this discussion is the notion that various morphological features, intrinsic factors, diseases, and injuries independently and interactively influence deep body temperature during exercise and/or exposure to hot ambient temperatures. The first sections review fundamental aspects of the human heat stress response, including the biophysical principles governing heat balance and the autonomic control of heat loss thermoeffectors. Next, we discuss the effects of different intrinsic factors (morphology, heat adaptation, biological sex, and age), diseases (neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and genetic), and injuries (spinal cord injury, deep burns, and heat stroke), with emphasis on the mechanisms by which these factors enhance or disturb the regulation of deep body temperature during heat stress. We conclude with key unanswered questions in this field of research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLR7 (Toll-like receptor 7), the sensor for single-stranded RNA, contributes to systemic inflammation and mortality in murine polymicrobial sepsis. Recent studies show that extracellular miR-146a-5p serves as a TLR7 ligand and plays an important role in regulating host innate immunity. However, the role of miR-146a-5p and TLR7 signaling in pulmonary inflammation, endothelial activation, and sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome remains unclear. Here, we show that intratracheal administration of exogenous miR-146a-5p in mice evokes lung inflammation, activates endothelium, and increases endothelial permeability via TLR7-dependent mechanisms. TLR7 deficiency attenuates pulmonary barrier dysfunction and reduces lung inflammatory response in a murine sepsis model. Moreover, the impact of miR-146a-5p-TLR7 signaling on endothelial activation appears to be a secondary effect because TLR7 is undetectable in the human pulmonary artery and microvascular endothelial cells (ECs), which show no response to direct miR-146a-5p treatment &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Both conditioned media of miR-146a-5p-treated macrophages (Mϕ) and septic sera of wild-type mice induce a marked EC barrier disruption &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, whereas Mϕ conditioned media or septic sera of &lt;em&gt;TLR7&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice do not exhibit such effect. Cytokine array and pathway enrichment analysis of the Mϕ conditioned media and septic sera identify TNFα (tumor necrosis factor α) as the main downstream effector of miR-146a-5p-TLR7 signaling responsible for the EC barrier dysfunction, which is further supported by neutralizing anti-TNFα antibody intervention. Together, these data demonstrate that TLR7 activation elicits pulmonary inflammation and endothelial barrier disruption by sensing extracellular miR-146a-5p and contributes to sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shema Oral Liquid Ameliorates the Severity of LPS-Induced COPD via Regulating DNMT1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35754478/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most common respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality. Shema oral liquid (Shema) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approved for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Clinical applications have shown that Shema has antitussive, expectorant, and anti-asthmatic effects, but its definite efficacy to COPD is still unclear. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic capacity and potential mechanism of Shema in treatment of COPD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Network pharmacology was used to investigated the possible pharmacological mechanism of Shema against COPD. A rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced COPD was established to determine pulmonary ventilatory function, serum inflammatory cytokines, and pulmonary pathological change. Subsequently, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics was used to further reveal the therapeutic targets related with Shema against COPD. Western blot was finally performed to validate the expression of targeted proteins screened by proteomics research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Network pharmacology analysis indicated that Shema against COPD mainly inhibited the inflammation and affected the immune system. The animal experiment demonstrated that Shema treatment protected the lung tissue from LPS induced injury, inhibited the levels of serum inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and improved the respiratory ventilatory function by upregulating forced expiratory volume in 0.1 s (FEV0.1), FEV0.3, forced vital capacity (FVC), and the ratios of FEV0.1 (0.3)/FVC. Proteomic analysis and western blot both proved that Shema inhibited the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The therapeutic mechanism of Shema in treatment of COPD may involve inhibiting inflammatory response, improving pulmonary ventilatory function, and alleviating LPS-induced lung injury through regulating the expression of DNMT1. This study also shed light on the development of therapeutic strategies in treating COPD by intervening DNMT-related pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electronic cigarette vapor exposure exaggerates the pro-inflammatory response during influenza A viral infection in human distal airway epithelium</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic cigarettes or vaping products have been marketed as a safer alternative to smoking, but very little is known about the health effects in the human lung, particularly in the distal airways, a key site of airway obstruction and destruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is often exacerbated by viral infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of electronic cigarette vapor (e-vapor) on human distal airway epithelial responses to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We isolated primary small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) from donor lungs free of lung disease, and cultured them at air-liquid interface (ALI). To measure markers of epithelial injury such as integrity of epithelial barrier structure and function, we selected a regimen of non-toxic, barrier preserving e-vapor exposure of cultured cells to 15 puffs of e-vapor from a commercially available e-cigarette once per day for 3 days, prior to IAV infection. After 72 h of infection, media and cell lysates were collected to measure cytokines involved in inflammatory and antiviral responses. Pre-exposure to e-vapor with IAV infection, compared to IAV infection alone, significantly increased inflammatory and antiviral mediators including IL-8, CXCL10, IFN-beta, and MX1. Our results suggest that e-vapor exposure amplifies human distal airway pro-inflammatory response to IAV infection, independently of the severity of cell injury during viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PTPα promotes fibroproliferative responses after acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35670474/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major healthcare problem, accounting for significant mortality and long-term disability. Approximately 25% of patients with ARDS will develop an overexuberant fibrotic response, termed fibroproliferative ARDS (FP-ARDS) that portends a poor prognosis and increased mortality. The cellular pathological processes that drive FP-ARDS remain incompletely understood. We have previously shown that the transmembrane receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase protein tyrosine phosphatase-α (PTPα) promotes pulmonary fibrosis in preclinical murine models through regulation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling. In this study, we examine the role of PTPα in the pathogenesis of FP-ARDS in a preclinical murine model of acid (HCl)-induced acute lung injury. We demonstrate that although mice genetically deficient in PTPα (&lt;em&gt;Ptpra&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) are susceptible to early HCl-induced lung injury, they exhibit markedly attenuated fibroproliferative responses. In addition, early profibrotic gene expression is reduced in lung tissue after acute lung injury in &lt;em&gt;Ptpra&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, and stimulation of naïve lung fibroblasts with the BAL fluid from these mice results in attenuated fibrotic outcomes compared with wild-type littermate controls. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrate reduced extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and remodeling in mice genetically deficient in PTPα. Importantly, human lung fibroblasts modified with a CRISPR-targeted deletion of &lt;em&gt;PTPRA&lt;/em&gt; exhibit reduced expression of profibrotic genes in response to TGF-β stimulation, demonstrating the importance of PTPα in human lung fibroblasts. Together, these findings demonstrate that PTPα is a key regulator of fibroproliferative processes following acute lung injury and could serve as a therapeutic target for patients at risk for poor long-term outcomes in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CaMK4 Promotes Acute Lung Injury Through NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation in Type II Alveolar Epithelial Cell</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35734175/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Type II alveolar epithelial cell (AEC II), in addition to its roles in maintaining lung homeostasis, takes an active role in inflammatory response during acute lung injury (ALI). Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK4) activated by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin signaling, has been implicated in immune responses. This study was to investigate the roles of CaMK4 in the development of ALI and the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; CaMK4 inhibitor KN-93 was used to investigate the effects of CaMK4 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The effects of KN-93 on disease development of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI were also evaluated. The role of CaMK4 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation was explored in human AEC II cell line A549 using KN-93 or CaMK4 siRNA. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was measured by histology immunofluorescence and Western blot. IL-1β and IL-18 were measured by ELISA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Phosphorylation of CaMK4 and the expression of NLRP3 and Caspase-1 p20 were increased in the lungs of LPS-induced ALI mice, which was suppressed by KN-93 as measured by Western blot. Further, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was detected in AEC II from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and LPS-induced ALI mice. In vitro, inhibition or silencing CaMK4 in AEC II significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, resulting in reduced IL-1β production. The inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and decreased IL-1β/IL-18 production by KN-93 led to reduced inflammatory infiltration and ameliorated lung injury in LPS-induced ALI mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; CaMK4 controls the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in AEC II during LPS-induced ALI. CaMK4 inhibition could be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigallocatechin Gallate Relieved PM2.5-Induced Lung Fibrosis by Inhibiting Oxidative Damage and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition through AKT/mTOR Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35707275/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative damage and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are main pathological processes leading to the development of PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis. Epigallocatechin gallate (EG), a natural polyphenol extracted from green tea, possesses the ability to combat oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the potential roles of EG in PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis have not been reported yet. In the present study, we investigated whether EG could relieve PM2.5-induced lung injury and fibrosis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. To mimic PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis, C57/BL6 mice were intranasally instilled with PM2.5 suspension, and MLE-12 lung epithelial cells were stimulated with PM2.5 (100 μg/mL) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. The results showed that intragastric administration of EG (20 mg/kg/d or 80 mg/kg/d for 8 weeks) significantly prevented lung injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress in PM2.5-induced mice, apart from inhibiting collagen deposition. Additionally, EG treatment also suppressed the activation of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in lung tissues challenged with PM2.5. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments further demonstrated that EG treatment could enhance cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner in PM2.5-treated MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. Also, the overexpression of constitutively active AKT could offset the inhibitory effects of EG on EMT and oxidative stress in PM2.5-treated MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. Finally, AKT overexpression also blocked the inhibitory effect of EG on the phosphorylation of mTOR in PM2.5-treated MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. In conclusion, EG could improve PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis by decreasing oxidative damage and EMT through AKT/mTOR pathway, which might be a potential candidate for the treatment of PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ginkgolide C Alleviates Acute Lung Injury Caused by Paraquat Poisoning via Regulating the Nrf2 and NF- κ B Signaling Pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35707280/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paraquat (PQ), a highly toxic herbicide and primary attack for lung, results in severe acute lung injury (ALI) appeared as evident oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Increasing evidence elucidates that nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) exhibit many merits for protection of ALI by coordinating a fine-turned response to oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Ginkgolide C (GC) has been reported to be a safe and potent therapeutic agent against ALI. However, whether GC could protect ALI induced by PQ poisoning and the possible underlining mechanisms have remained not to be fully elucidated. A rat model of ALI and a model of acute type II alveolar epithelial cell (RLE-6TN) injury constructed by exposure to PQ were applied to discuss the protective effect of GC. Furthermore, Nrf2 gene silencing RLE-6TN cells were used to discuss the exact mechanism. We confirmed that GC significantly ameliorated the histopathological damages, ultrastructural changes, lung injury score, W/D ratio, and Hyp activity of lung tissue and inhibited polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration after PQ poisoning. Further results revealed that GC remarkably activated Nrf2-based cytoprotective system and inhibited NF-κB-induced inflammatory injury as well as apoptosis. Taken together, we concluded that GC preserved protection of PQ-induced ALI via the Nrf2-NF-κB dependent signal pathway, which may provide us novel insights into the treatment strategies for PQ poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-155 deficiency protects renal tubular epithelial cells from telomeric and genomic DNA damage in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35832084/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Cisplatin nephrotoxicity is an important cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), limiting cisplatin application in cancer therapy. Growing evidence has suggested that genome instability, telomeric dysfunction, and DNA damage were involved in the tubular epithelial cells (TECs) damage in cisplatin-induced AKI (cAKI). However, the exact mechanism is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We subjected miR-155&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice and wild-type controls, as well as HK-2 cells, to cAKI models. We assessed kidney function and injury with standard techniques. The cell apoptosis and DNA damage of TECs were evaluated both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Telomeres were measured by the fluorescence &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; hybridization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The expression level of miR-155 was upregulated in cAKI. Inhibition of miR-155 expression protected cisplatin-induced AKI both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Compared with wild-type mice, miR-155&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had reduced mortality, improved renal function and pathological damage after cisplatin intervention. Moreover, inhibition of miR-155 expression attenuated TECs apoptosis and DNA damage. These protective effects were caused by increasing expression of telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12), thereby limiting the telomeric dysfunction and the genomic DNA damage in cAKI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrated that miR-155 deficiency could significantly attenuate pathological damage and mortality in cAKI through inhibition of TECs apoptosis, genome instability, and telomeric dysfunction, which is possibly regulated by the increasing expression of TRF1 and CDK12. This study will provide a new molecular strategy for the prevention of cAKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel drug delivery systems and disease models for pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35636615/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a serious and progressive lung disease which is possibly life-threatening. It causes lung scarring and affects lung functions including epithelial cell injury, massive recruitment of immune cells and abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). There is currently no cure for PF. Treatment for PF is aimed at slowing the course of the disease and relieving symptoms. Pirfenidone (PFD) and nintedanib (NDNB) are currently the only two FDA-approved oral medicines to slow down the progress of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a specific type of PF. Novel drug delivery systems and therapies have been developed to improve the prognosis of the disease, as well as reduce or minimize the toxicities during drug treatment. The drug delivery routes for these therapies are various including oral, intravenous, nasal, inhalant, intratracheal and transdermal; although this is dependent on specific treatment mechanisms. In addition, researchers have also expanded current animal models that could not fully restore the clinicopathology, and developed a series of in vitro models such as organoids to study the pathogenesis and treatment of PF. This review describes recent advances on pathogenesis exploration, classifies and specifies the progress of drug delivery systems by their delivery routes, as well as an overview on the in vitro and in vivo models for PF research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease caused by the severe and acute response of the lungs to a variety of direct and indirect insults. Patients with ALI are currently treated mainly with respiratory support due to inadequate understanding of ALI progression. Alveolar epithelial cells produced thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been proved to worsen ALI by triggering airway inflammation. However, the regulation mechanism of TSLP expression remains unclear. In this study, we identified the crucial role played by circNCLN in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. We demonstrated for the first time that miR-291a-3p could directly bind to the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR of TSLP and suppress TSLP expression in alveolar epithelial cells. Mechanistically, our data identified that circNCLN acts as a molecular sponge to antagonize miR-291a-3p and thereby maintaining the expression of TSLP in alveolar epithelial cells. Importantly, targeting circNCLN by its antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) markedly alleviated LPS-induced ALI. Therefore, our results suggested that circNCLN/miR-291a-3p/TSLP axis may be an important signaling in LPS-induced ALI and circNCLN inhibition may serve as a potential treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A high-calorie diet aggravates LPS-induced pneumonia by disturbing the gut microbiota and Th17/Treg balance</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intestinal flora plays an important role in the inflammatory response to the systemic or local infections in the host. A high-calorie diet has been shown to aggravate pneumonia and delay recovery, especially in children. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous studies demonstrated that a high-calorie diet and LPS atomization synergistically promoted lung inflammation injury in juvenile rats. In this study, specific pathogen-free juvenile rats were placed in a routine environment, and subjected to a high-calorie diet or LPS atomization in isolation as well as combination. Our data revealed that LPS nebulization combined with a high-calorie diet resulted in significant changes in rats, such as slow weight gain, increased lung index, and aggravated lung inflammatory damage. Meanwhile, we found that the aggravation of LPS-induced pneumonia by a high-calorie diet disturbs the balance of Th17/Treg cells. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of intestinal contents revealed that a high-calorie diet changed the gut microbiome composition, decreased microbial diversity, and particularly reduced the abundance of the intestinal microbiota associated with the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in rats. Consequently, the levels of SCFAs, especially acetate, propionate, and butyrate, were significantly decreased following the intervention of a high-calorie diet. More critically, the effects of a high-calorie diet were shown to be transmissible among pneumonia rats through cohousing microbiota transplantation. Taken together, we provide evidence to support that a high-calorie diet can potentially reset the gut microbiome and metabolites, disrupt Th17/Treg cell balance and immune homeostasis, and aggravate LPS-induced lung inflammatory damage, which may provide a new perspective on the pathogenesis of lung inflammation injury, and suggest a novel microbiota-targeting therapy for inflammatory lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hippocampal avoidance prophylactic cranial irradiation (HA-PCI) for small cell lung cancer reduces hippocampal atrophy compared to conventional PCI</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35640975/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Reducing radiation dose to the hippocampus with hippocampal avoidance prophylactic cranial irradiation (HA-PCI) is proposed to prevent cognitive decline. It has, however, not been investigated whether hippocampal atrophy is actually mitigated by this approach. Here, we determined whether HA-PCI reduces hippocampal atrophy. Additionally, we evaluated neurotoxicity of (HA-)PCI to other brain regions. Finally, we evaluated associations of hippocampal atrophy and brain neurotoxicity with memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; High-quality research MRI scans were acquired in the multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial NCT01780675. Hippocampal atrophy was evaluated for 4 months (57 HA-PCI patients and 46 PCI patients) and 12 months (28 HA-PCI patients and 27 PCI patients) after (HA-)PCI. We additionally studied multimodal indices of brain injury. Memory was assessed with the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; HA-PCI reduced hippocampal atrophy at 4 months (1.8% for HA-PCI and 3.0% for PCI) and at 12 months (3.0% for HA-PCI and 5.8% for PCI). Both HA-PCI and PCI were associated with considerable reductions in gray matter and normal-appearing white matter, increases in white matter hyperintensities, and brain aging. There were no significant associations between hippocampal atrophy and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; HA-PCI reduces hippocampal atrophy at 4 and 12 months compared to regular PCI. Both types of radiotherapy are associated with considerable brain injury. We did not find evidence for excessive brain injury after HA-PCI relative to PCI. Hippocampal atrophy was not associated with memory decline in this population as measured with HVLT-R. The usefulness of HA-PCI is still subject to debate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intraarticularly injectable silk hydrogel microspheres with enhanced mechanical and structural stability to attenuate osteoarthritis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35660867/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A silk fibroin (silk) hydrogel was prepared by using diglycidyl ether (BDDE), a chemical crosslinker commonly used to generate Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved hyaluronic acid (HA) medical products. The silk/BDDE hydrogels exhibited high elasticity (compressive modulus of 166 ± 15.0 kPa), anti-fatigue properties, and stable structure and mechanical strength in aqueous solution. Chemical crosslinking was conducted in a high concentration (9.3 M) of lithium bromide (LiBr) solution, a salt that is commonly used to dissolve degummed silk fibers during silk solubilization. The unfolded and extended structure of silk molecules with these reaction conditions, as well as the unique ionic environment provided by LiBr facilitated a high degree of crosslinking in the hydrogel. Similar hydrogels were not obtained when the silk was dissolved in other silk fiber-dissolving reagents (——, Ajisawa&amp;rsquo;s, formic acid (FA)/LiBr, FA/CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solutions), likely because partially folded silk structures and the ionic conditions with these reagents were less favorable for the crosslinking reaction. Based on these findings, silk/BDDE hydrogel spheres were prepared using an oil/water (o/w) emulsification method and biocompatibility and biodegradation were evaluated in vivo, along with other silk gel control systems (e.g., enzyme-catalyzed di-tyrosine and pulverized silk/BDDE gel particles with irregular shapes). Histological and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that the silk/BDDE hydrogel spheres were biocompatible and served as a bio-lubricant to treat osteoarthritis (OA). The intra-articular injection of the gel spheres reduced pain as measured with OA rats, reduced cartilage damage and resisted the digestive environment in the articular cavity for extended time frames (&amp;gt;4 weeks), suggesting utility for pain relief and sustained drug release for future OA treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MG53 Inhibits Necroptosis Through Ubiquitination-Dependent RIPK1 Degradation for Cardiac Protection Following Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35711363/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; While reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been recognized as one of the main causes of cardiac injury following myocardial infarction, the clinical application of antioxidants has shown limited effects on protecting hearts against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Thus, the precise role of ROS following cardiac injury remains to be fully elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the role of mitsugumin 53 (MG53) in regulating necroptosis following I/R injury to the hearts and the involvement of ROS in MG53-mediated cardioprotection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and results:&lt;/em&gt; Antioxidants were used to test the role of ROS in MG53-mediated cardioprotection in the mouse model of I/R injury and induced human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia or re-oxygenation (H/R) injury. Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation were used to identify potential cell death pathways that MG53 was involved in. CRISPR/Cas 9-mediated genome editing and mutagenesis assays were performed to further identify specific interaction amino acids between MG53 and its ubiquitin E3 ligase substrate. We found that MG53 could protect myocardial injury via inhibiting the necroptosis pathway. Upon injury, the generation of ROS in the infarct zone of the hearts promoted interaction between MG53 and receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, MG53 added multiple ubiquitin chains to RIPK1 at the sites of K316, K604, and K627 for proteasome-mediated RIPK1 degradation and inhibited necroptosis. The application of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) disrupted the interaction between MG53 and RIPK1 and abolished MG53-mediated cardioprotective effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Taken together, this study provided a molecular mechanism of a potential beneficial role of ROS following acute myocardial infarction. Thus, fine-tuning ROS levels might be critical for cardioprotection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polyphenols-Rich Fraction from Annona muricata Linn. Leaves Attenuates Oxidative and Inflammatory Responses in Neutrophils, Macrophages, and Experimental Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annona muricata&lt;/em&gt; Linn. is a common plant found in the warmest regions of South and Central America and its use in traditional medicine has been reported for the treatment of various illnesses. In the current study, we investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of crude extract and fractions from &lt;em&gt;A. muricata&lt;/em&gt; L. leaves in isolated murine phagocytic immune cells as well as experimental LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI). In a luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assay, we showed that ethyl acetate (EtOAc.f) and n-butanol (BuOH.f) fractions-both rich in polyphenols-reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils stimulated with opsonized zymosan; similar results were found in culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). By evaluating anti-inflammatory activity in BMDMs, EtOAc.f and BuOH.f reduced secretion of IL-6 and expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD40. Furthermore, in LPS-induced ALI, oral administration of EtOAc.f reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissue. In addition, on a mechanism dependent on glutathione levels, the oxidative damage was also attenuated. These findings revealed direct antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of polyphenols-rich fractions of &lt;em&gt;A. muricata&lt;/em&gt; L. leaves on neutrophils and macrophages. Moreover, the reduced oxidative damage and levels of inflammatory markers in experimental ALI suggest that these fractions might be explored for the development of new therapies for inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RNA seq and ceRNA network analysis in the rat model of chronic kidney disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35578844/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) containing microRNA (miRNA) response elements (MREs) can be used as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression profile and role of mRNAs and lncRNAs in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model rats and to explore any associated competing endogenous (ceRNA) network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Using the UUO model, the obstructed kidney was collected on the 15th day after surgery. RNA Seq analysis was performed on renal tissues of four UUO rats and four sham rats. Four mRNAs and four lncRNAs of differentially expressed genes were randomly selected for real time quantitative PCR (RT qPCR) analysis.Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were analyzed, and bioinformatics was used to predict MREs. By screening for ceRNAs combined with target gene prediction, a related ceRNA network was constructed and verified by RT qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We identified 649 up-regulated lncRNAs, 518 down-regulated lncRNAs, 924 down-regulated mRNAs and 2029 up-regulated mRNAs. We identified the 30 pathways with the highest enrichment in GO and KEGG. According to the RNA Seq results and the expression of Nr4a1, the network was constructed based on Nr4a1, and included two MREs and ten lncRNAs. Furthermore, lncNONRATT011668.2/miR-361-3p/Nr4a1 was identified and verified according to ceRNA sequencing and target gene prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; mRNAs and lncRNAs are differentially expressed in UUO model rats, which may be related to the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease. The lncNONRATT011668.2/miR-361-3p/Nr4a1 ceRNA network may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Angiotensin 1-7 mitigates rhabdomyolysis induced renal injury in rats via modulation of TLR-4/NF-kB/iNOS and Nrf-2/heme‑oxygenase-1 signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35654118/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RM induced kidney injury may be linked to the depletion of the ACE-2 and Ang1–7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ACE-2/Ang1–7/MasR axis may serve as a novel therapeutic option in RM-induced AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TLR-4/NF-kB/iNOS pathway may be involved in the renoprotective effect of Ang1–7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a critical condition with a high mortality rate, but effective management is still deficient. Till date, there are no studies that have addressed the effect of angiotensin 1-7 in this condition, hence, the rationale of this study was to evaluate the potential protective effect of Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7), on rhabdomyolysis (RM) induced kidney injury in rats and detecting the underlying mechanistic insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; Forty adult male albino rats were divided into groups; the control group, RM group, RM+Ang1-7 group, and RM+Ang1-7+ A779 group. Sera and urine samples were collected for analysis of renal and muscle injury markers. Kidney tissues were taken for estimation of oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers as well as angiotensin-II (Ang II) and Ang1-7. Renal histology and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase-1 (iNOS), real-time PCR for angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), nuclear erythroid factor-2 (Nrf-2), Toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and NF-kB in kidney tissues were also measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; Induction of RM caused renal oxidative stress injury, inflammation, apoptosis and marked deterioration in kidney functions as well as reduction of Ang1-7 and raised Angiotensin-II level in kidney tissues. Administration of Ang1-7 to the RM group reversed all the affected parameters which were blocked by A779 administration (Mas receptor blocker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; We concluded that Ang1-7 could be a potential therapeutic agent that could mitigate RM-induced renal injury. The underlying mechanisms may involve Stimulation of the ACE-2/Ang1-7/MasR axis and modulation of TLR-4/NF-kB/iNOS and Nrf-2/heme‑oxygenase -1 pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Caloric restriction reduces the pro-inflammatory eicosanoid 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid to protect from acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35654224/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury is a frequent complication in the clinical setting and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Preconditioning with short-term caloric restriction is highly protective against kidney injury in rodent ischemia reperfusion injury models. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown hampering clinical translation. Here, we examined the molecular basis of caloric restriction-mediated protection to elucidate the principles of kidney stress resistance. Analysis of an RNAseq dataset after caloric restriction identified Cyp4a12a, a cytochrome exclusively expressed in male mice, to be strongly downregulated after caloric restriction. Kidney ischemia reperfusion injury robustly induced acute kidney injury in male mice and this damage could be markedly attenuated by pretreatment with caloric restriction. In females, damage was significantly less pronounced and preconditioning with caloric restriction had only little effect. Tissue concentrations of the metabolic product of Cyp4a12a, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), were found to be significantly reduced by caloric restriction. Conversely, intraperitoneal supplementation of 20-HETE in preconditioned males partly abrogated the protective potential of caloric restriction. Interestingly, this effect was accompanied by a partial reversal of caloric restriction&amp;ndash;induced changes in protein but not RNA expression pointing towards inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress and lipid metabolism. Thus, our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying kidney protection by caloric restriction. Hence, understanding the mediators of preconditioning is an important prerequisite for moving towards translation to the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic pathway in eukaryotic cells, contributes to the maintenance of the homeostasis and function of the kidney. Upon acute kidney injury (AKI), autophagy is activated in renal tubular cells to act as an intrinsic protective mechanism. However, the role of autophagy in the development of chronic kidney pathologies including renal fibrosis after AKI remains unclear. In this study, we detected a persistent autophagy activation in mouse kidneys after nephrotoxicity of repeated low dose cisplatin (RLDC) treatment. 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ), respective inhibitors of autophagy at the initiation and degradation stages, blocked autophagic flux and improved kidney repair in post-RLDC mice, as indicated by kidney weight, renal function, and less interstitial fibrosis. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, RLDC induced a pro-fibrotic phenotype in renal tubular cells, including the production and secretion of pro-fibrotic cytokines. Notably, autophagy inhibitors blocked RLDC-induced secretion of pro-fibrotic cytokines in these cells. Together, the results indicate that persistent autophagy after AKI induces pro-fibrotic cytokines in renal tubular cells, promoting renal fibrosis and chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigallocatechin gallate relieves asthmatic symptoms in mice by suppressing HIF-1α/VEGFA-mediated M2 skewing of macrophages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is an active catechin in green tea and has multiple biological functions, such as anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, and immune regulation. This work aimed to study the protective function of EGCG against asthma and the mechanism. Asthma in mice was induced by house dust mite (HDM) challenge. EGCG treatment alleviated tissue injury, inflammation, mucus production and collagen deposition, and it reduced M2 macrophage infiltration in mouse lung tissues induced by HDM. The bioinformatics analyses in this study suggested that target genes of EGCG were enriched in the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway, EGCG treatment targeted HIF-1α and thereby suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) activation. Adenovirus (AAV) overexpression vectors of HIF-1α and VEGFA were administrated into mice after EGCG treatment. Either restoration of HIF-1α or VEGFA significantly blocked the protective functions of EGCG treatment against HDM-induced allergic asthma. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that EGCG treatment relieves asthmatic symptoms in mice by suppressing HIF-1α/VEGFA-mediated M2 skewing of macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxemia is a defining feature of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an often-fatal complication of pulmonary or systemic inflammation, yet the resulting tissue hypoxia, and its impact on immune responses, is often neglected. In the present study, we have shown that ARDS patients were hypoxemic and monocytopenic within the first 48 h of ventilation. Monocytopenia was also observed in mouse models of hypoxic acute lung injury, in which hypoxemia drove the suppression of type I interferon signaling in the bone marrow. This impaired monopoiesis resulted in reduced accumulation of monocyte-derived macrophages and enhanced neutrophil-mediated inflammation in the lung. Administration of colony-stimulating factor 1 in mice with hypoxic lung injury rescued the monocytopenia, altered the phenotype of circulating monocytes, increased monocyte-derived macrophages in the lung and limited injury. Thus, tissue hypoxia altered the dynamics of the immune response to the detriment of the host and interventions to address the aberrant response offer new therapeutic strategies for ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lineage tracing analysis defines erythropoietin-producing cells as a distinct subpopulation of resident fibroblasts with unique behaviors</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35644281/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erythropoietin (Epo) is produced by a subpopulation of resident fibroblasts in the healthy kidney. We have previously demonstrated that, during kidney fibrosis, kidney fibroblasts including Epo-producing cells transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts and lose their Epo-producing ability. However, it remains unclear whether Epo-producing cells survive and transform into myofibroblasts during fibrosis because previous studies did not specifically label Epo-producing cells in pathophysiological conditions. Here, we generated &lt;em&gt;Epo&lt;sup&gt;CreERT2/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, a novel mouse strain that enables labeling of Epo-producing cells at desired time points and examined the behaviors of Epo-producing cells under pathophysiological conditions. Lineage-labeled cells that were producing Epo when labeled were found to be a small subpopulation of fibroblasts located in the interstitium of the kidney, and their number increased during phlebotomy-induced anemia. Around half of lineage-labeled cells expressed Epo mRNA, and this percentage was maintained even 16 weeks after recombination, supporting the idea that a distinct subpopulation of cells with Epo-producing ability makes Epo repeatedly. During fibrosis caused by ureteral obstruction, &lt;em&gt;Epo&lt;sup&gt;CreERT2/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;-labeled cells were found to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts with concomitant loss of Epo-producing ability, and their numbers and the proportion among resident fibroblasts increased during fibrosis, indicating their high proliferative capacity. Finally, we confirmed that &lt;em&gt;Epo&lt;sup&gt;CreERT2/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;-labeled cells that lost their Epo-producing ability during fibrosis regained their ability after kidney repair due to relief of the ureteral obstruction. Thus, our analyses have revealed previously unappreciated characteristic behaviors of Epo-producing cells, which had not been clearly distinguished from those of resident fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumonia and its sequelae, acute lung injury, present unique challenges for pulmonary and critical care healthcare professionals, and these challenges have recently garnered global attention due to the ongoing Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. One limitation to translational investigation of acute lung injury, including its most severe manifestation (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) has been heterogeneity resulting from the clinical and physiologic diagnosis that represents a wide variety of etiologies. Recent efforts have improved our understanding and approach to heterogeneity by defining sub-phenotypes of ARDS although significant gaps in knowledge remain. Improving our mechanistic understanding of acute lung injury and its most common cause, infectious pneumonia, can advance our approach to precision targeted clinical interventions. Here, we review the pathogenesis of pneumonia and acute lung injury, including how respiratory infections and lung injury disrupt lung homoeostasis, and provide an overview of respiratory microbial pathogenesis, the lung microbiome, and interventions that have been demonstrated to improve outcomes-or not-in human clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stat3/IL-6 signaling mediates sustained pneumonia induced by Agiostrongylus cantonensis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35617354/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angiostrongylus cantonensis (AC) is well-documented that parasitizes the host brain and causes eosinophilic meningitis. The migration route of AC in permissive hosts is well demonstrated, while in nonpermissive hosts, it remains to be fully defined. In the present study, we exploited live imaging technology, morphological and pathological configuration analysis, and molecular biological technologies to explore the migration route of AC and the accompanying tissue damage in nonpermissive and permissive hosts. Our data indicated that, in nonpermissive host mouse, AC larvae migrated from intestinal wall to liver at 2 hours post-infection (hpi), from liver to lung at 4 hpi and then from lung to brain at 8 hpi. AC larval migration caused fatal lung injury (pneumonia) during acute and early infection phases, along with significant activation of Stat3/IL-6 signaling. In addition, AC induce sustained interstitial pneumonia in mouse and rat and pulmonary fibrosis only in rat during late infection phase. Moreover, during the early and late infection phases, Th2 cytokine expression and Stat3 and IL-6 signaling were persistently enhanced and myeloid macrophage cells were notably enriched in host lung, and administration of Stat3 and IL-6 inhibitors (C188-9 and LMT-28) attenuated AC infection-induced acute pneumonia in mice. Overall, we are the first to provide direct and systemic laboratory evidence of AC migration route in a nonpermissive host and report that infection with a high dose of AC larvae could result in acute and fatal pneumonia through Stat3/IL-6 signaling in mice. These findings may present a feasible to rational strategy to minimize the pathogenesis induced by AC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aberrant Multiciliogenesis in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35608953/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We previously identified a novel molecular subtype of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) defined by increased expression of cilium-associated genes, airway mucin gene MUC5B, and KRT5 marker of basal cell airway progenitors. Here we show the association of MUC5B and cilia gene expression in human IPF airway epithelial cells, providing further rationale for examining the role of cilium genes in the pathogenesis of IPF. We demonstrate increased multiciliogenesis and changes in motile cilia structure of multiciliated cells both in IPF and bleomycin lung fibrosis models. Importantly, conditional deletion of a cilium gene, Ift88 (intraflagellar transport 88), in Krt5 basal cells reduces Krt5 pod formation and lung fibrosis, whereas no changes are observed in Ift88 conditional deletion in club cell progenitors. Our findings indicate that aberrant injury-activated primary ciliogenesis and Hedgehog signaling may play a causative role in Krt5 pod formation, which leads to aberrant multiciliogenesis and lung fibrosis. This implies that modulating cilium gene expression in Krt5 cell progenitors is a potential therapeutic target for IPF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular mitochondria drive CD8 T cell dysfunction in trauma by upregulating CD39</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35613855/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; The increased mortality and morbidity seen in critically injured patients appears associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and immune dysfunction, which ultimately predisposes to infection. Mitochondria released by injury could generate danger molecules, for example, ATP, which in turn would be rapidly scavenged by ectonucleotidases, expressed on regulatory immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To determine the association between circulating mitochondria, purinergic signalling and immune dysfunction after trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We tested the impact of hepatocyte-derived free mitochondria on blood-derived and lung-derived CD8 T cells in vitro and in experimental mouse models in vivo. In parallel, immune phenotypic analyses were conducted on blood-derived CD8 T cells obtained from trauma patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Isolated intact mitochondria are functional and generate ATP ex vivo. Extracellular mitochondria perturb CD8+ T cells in co-culture, inducing select features of immune exhaustion in vitro. These effects are modulated by scavenging ATP, modelled by addition of apyrase in vitro. Injection of intact mitochondria into recipient mice markedly upregulates the ectonucleotidase CD39, and other immune checkpoint markers in circulating CD8+ T cells. We note that mice injected with mitochondria, prior to instilling bacteria into the lung, exhibit more severe lung injury, characterised by elevated neutrophil influx and by changes in CD8+ T cell cytotoxic capacity. Importantly, the development of SIRS in injured humans, is likewise associated with disordered purinergic signalling and CD8 T cell dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These studies in experimental models and in a cohort of trauma patients reveal important associations between extracellular mitochondria, aberrant purinergic signalling and immune dysfunction. These pathogenic factors with immune exhaustion are linked to SIRS and could be targeted therapeutically.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Vivo Imaging of Circadian NET Formation During Lung Injury by Four-Dimensional Intravital Microscopy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are toxic extracellular structures deployed by neutrophils in response to pathogens and sterile danger signals. NETs are circadian in nature as mouse and human neutrophils preferentially deploy them at night or early morning. Traditionally, NETs have been quantified using a plethora of methods including immunofluorescence and ELISA-based assays; however few options are available to visualize them in vivo. Here we describe a method to directly visualize and quantify NET formation and release in the microvasculature of the lung using intravital imaging in a model of acute lung injury. The method allows four-dimensional capture and quantification of NET formation dynamics over time and should be a useful resource for those interested in visualizing neutrophil responses &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>METTL3-Mediated N6-Methyladenosine Modification of Trim59 mRNA Protects Against Sepsis-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35693774/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N6-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA modification is a fundamental determinant of mRNA metabolism in eukaryotic cells and is involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. However, the specific role of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification in sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) remains unknown. Here, we show that the levels of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A RNA were significantly decreased in septic lungs and that METTL3 was the main regulator involved in the absence of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A RNA modification. Pulmonary endothelial barrier damage is a critical process in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury during sepsis. METTL3 regulated endothelial barrier dysfunction and inflammatory responses in sepsis-induced ARDS &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Furthermore, we identified tripartite motif-containing (Trim)59 as a key m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A effector and Trim59 deficiency exacerbated lung injury. Mechanistically, METTL3 inhibited endothelial injury in sepsis-induced ARDS through Trim59-associated NF-κB inactivation. Our findings revealed novel insights into epitranscriptional mechanisms in sepsis-induced ARDS via m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modifications, which has important application value in the diagnosis, prognosis, and molecular-targeted therapy of sepsis-associated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myeloid-derived growth factor deficiency exacerbates mitotic catastrophe of podocytes in glomerular disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35623505/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podocytes are unique, highly specialized, terminally differentiated cells, which are restricted in a post-mitotic state with limited ability to repair or regenerate. Re-entering the mitotic phase causes podocyte mitotic catastrophe, thereby leading to podocyte death and glomerular injury. Myeloid-derived growth factor (MYDGF) is a novel secreted protein and plays an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular function. However, whether MYDGF is expressed in kidney parenchymal cells and whether it has biological functions in the kidney remain unknown. Here, we found that MYDGF was expressed in kidney parenchymal cells and was significantly reduced in podocytes from mice with models of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and diabetic kidney disease. Podocyte-specific deletion of Mydgf in mice exacerbated podocyte injury and proteinuria in both disease models. Functionally, MYDGF protected podocytes against mitotic catastrophe by reducing accumulation of podocytes in the S phase, a portion of the cell cycle in which DNA is replicated. Mechanistically, MYDGF regulates the expression of the transcription factor RUNX2 which mediates some MYDGF effects. Importantly, a significant reduction of MYDGF was found in glomeruli from patients with glomerular disease due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and diabetic kidney disease and the level of MYDGF was correlated with glomerular filtration rate, serum creatinine and podocyte loss. Thus, our studies indicate that MYDGF may be an attractive therapeutic target for glomerular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cell death and ischemia-reperfusion injury in lung transplantation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung transplantation is the most effective therapy for patients with end-stage lung disease. However, concern of donor lung damage and ischemia-reperfusion induced lung injury limits the use of &amp;ldquo;marginal&amp;rdquo; donor lungs. Recent transcriptomic studies have demonstrated that the enrichment of gene-clusters related to cell death and inflammation are the most profound signals during ischemia-reperfusion in human lung transplants. Herein, we focus on the relationship between inflammation and programmed cell death, especially necroptosis, mitochondrial permeability transition-initiated regulated necrosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagic cell death. Cell death-related molecules have been tested as potential biomarkers for donor lung assessment. Inhibitors for various types of cell death have been explored as therapeutics for ischemia reperfusion injury in lung transplantation. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms may help to improve donor management, organ preservation, prevention and treatment of primary graft dysfunction during and post transplantation. Moreover, evaluation and treatment of cell death and inflammation during ex vivo lung perfusion may be a game changer in donor organ management, assessment, repair, and reconditioning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insights gained in the pathology of lung disease through single-cell transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35608561/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human lung is a relatively quiescent organ in the normal healthy state but contains stem/progenitor cells that contribute to normal tissue maintenance and either repair or remodeling in response to injury and disease. Maintenance or repair lead to proper restoration of functional lung tissue and maintenance of physiological functions, with remodeling resulting in altered structure and function that is typically associated with disease. Knowledge of cell types contributing to lung tissue maintenance and repair/remodeling have largely relied on mouse models of injury-repair and lineage tracing of local progenitors. Therefore, many of the functional alterations underlying remodeling in human lung disease have remained poorly defined. However, the advent of advanced genomics approaches to define the molecular phenotype of lung cells at single-cell resolution has paved the way for rapid advances in our understanding of cell types present within the normal human lung and changes that accompany disease. Here we summarize recent advances in our understanding of disease-related changes in the molecular phenotype of human lung epithelium that have emerged from single-cell transcriptomic studies. We focus attention on emerging concepts of epithelial transitional states that characterize the pathological remodeling that accompanies chronic lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. Concepts arising from these studies are actively evolving and require corroborative studies to improve our understanding of disease mechanisms. Whenever possible, we highlight opportunities for providing a unified nomenclature in this rapidly advancing field of research. © 2022 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-Oleoyl dopamine induces IL-10 via central nervous system TRPV1 and improves endotoxemia and sepsis outcomes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35610647/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) participates in thermosensation and inflammatory pain, but its immunomodulatory mechanisms remain enigmatic. N-Oleoyl dopamine (OLDA), an endovanilloid and endocannabinoid, is a TRPV1 agonist that is produced in the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. We studied the anti-inflammatory effects and TRPV1-dependent mechanisms of OLDA in models of inflammation and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mice were challenged intratracheally or intravenously with LPS, or intratracheally with S. aureus to induce pneumonia and sepsis, and then were treated intravenously with OLDA. Endpoints included plasma cytokines, leukocyte activation marker expression, mouse sepsis scores, lung histopathology, and bacterial counts. The role of TRPV1 in the effects of OLDA was determined using Trpv1-/- mice, and mice with TRPV1 knockdown pan-neuronally, in peripheral nervous system neurons, or in myeloid cells. Circulating monocytes/macrophages were depleted using clodronate to determine their role in the anti-inflammatory effects of OLDA in endotoxemic mice. Levels of exogenous OLDA, and of endovanilloids and endocannabinoids, at baseline and in endotoxemic mice, were determined by LC-MS/MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; OLDA administration caused an early anti-inflammatory response in endotoxemic and septic mice with high serum levels of IL-10 and decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. OLDA also reduced lung injury and improved mouse sepsis scores. Blood and lung bacterial counts were comparable between OLDA- and carrier-treated mice with S. aureus pneumonia. OLDA&amp;rsquo;s effects were reversed in mice with pan-neuronal TRPV1 knockdown, but not with TRPV1 knockdown in peripheral nervous system neurons or myeloid cells. Depletion of monocytes/macrophages reversed the IL-10 upregulation by OLDA in endotoxemic mice. Brain and blood levels of endovanilloids and endocannabinoids were increased in endotoxemic mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; OLDA has strong anti-inflammatory actions in mice with endotoxemia or S. aureus pneumonia. Prior studies focused on the role of peripheral nervous system TRPV1 in modulating inflammation and pneumonia. Our results suggest that TRPV1-expressing central nervous system neurons also regulate inflammatory responses to endotoxemia and infection. Our study reveals a neuro-immune reflex that during acute inflammation is engaged proximally by OLDA acting on neuronal TRPV1, and through a multicellular network that requires circulating monocytes/macrophages, leads to the systemic production of IL-10.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Primary Graft Dysfunction: The Role of Aging in Lung Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35686120/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transplant centers around the world have been using extended criteria donors to remedy the ongoing demand for lung transplantation. With a rapidly aging population, older donors are increasingly considered. Donor age, at the same time has been linked to higher rates of lung ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). This process of acute, sterile inflammation occurring upon reperfusion is a key driver of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) leading to inferior short- and long-term survival. Understanding and improving the condition of older lungs is thus critical to optimize outcomes. Notably, &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; lung perfusion (EVLP) seems to have the potential of reconditioning ischemic lungs through &lt;em&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/em&gt; perfusing and ventilation. Here, we aim to delineate mechanisms driving lung IRI and review both experimental and clinical data on the effects of aging in augmenting the consequences of IRI and PGD in lung transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sophoridine inhibits endotoxin-induced acute lung injury by enhancing autophagy of macrophage and reducing inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35603481/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, which can lead to respiratory distress syndrome and cause patient death. In this study, we sought to determine the role of sophoridine, a compound purified from sophora, in ALI. A mouse model of ALI was established by treating mice with LPS through nonexposed tracheal instillation. After LPS-induced mice were treated with sophoridine, LPS-induced alveolar wall thickening, alveolar interstitial inflammatory exudation and thickening, and the degree of pulmonary edema were found to be inhibited. Macrophages play an important role in inflammation, and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that sophoridine reduces the LPS-induced expression of inflammatory factors by macrophages, suggesting that sophoridine may inhibit lung inflammation in LPS-treated mice through reduces the secretion of inflammatory factors. Further, treatment with sophoridine up-regulated autophagy in macrophage cells in vitro and mouse lung tissues in vivo. LPS can bind to TLRs and activate the MyD88/NF-κB pathways, leading to increased inflammation in the pathogenesis of ALI. Our findings revealed that sophoridine down-regulated the expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and mTOR mRNA and protein in mouse pulmonary tissue. Collectively, these findings indicate that sophoridine may inhibit LPS-induced ALI by enhancing autophagy of macrophages and reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Club cell protein (CC)16 as potential lung injury marker in a porcine 72 h polytrauma model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35596754/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Polytrauma and respiratory tract damage after thoracic trauma cause about 25% of mortality among severely injured patients. Thoracic trauma can lead to the development of severe lung complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, and is, therefore, of great interest for monitoring in intensive care units (ICU). In recent years, club cell protein (CC)16 with its antioxidant properties has proven to be a potential outcome-related marker. In this study, we evaluated whether CC16 constitutes as a marker of lung damage in a porcine polytrauma model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In a 72 h ICU polytrauma pig model (thoracic trauma, tibial fracture, hemorrhagic shock, liver laceration), blood plasma samples (0, 3, 9, 24, 48, 72 h), BAL samples (72 h) and lung tissue (72 h) were collected. The trauma group (PT) was compared to a sham group. CC16 as a possible biomarker for lung injury in this model, and IL-8 concentrations as known indicator for ongoing inflammation during trauma were determined by ELISA. Histological analysis of ZO-1 and determination of total protein content were used to show barrier disruption and edema formation in lung tissue from the trauma group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Systemic CC16 levels were significantly increased early after polytrauma compared vs. sham. After 72 h, CC16 concentration was significantly increased in lung tissue as well as in BAL in PT vs. sham. Similarly, IL-8 and total protein content in BAL were significantly increased in PT vs. sham. Evaluation of ZO-1 staining showed significantly lower signal intensity for polytrauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The data confirm for the first time in a larger animal polytrauma model that lung damage was indicated by systemic and/or local CC16 response. Thus, early plasma and late BAL CC16 levels might be suitable to be used as markers of lung injury in this polytrauma model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fudosteine attenuates acute lung injury in septic mice by inhibiting pyroptosis via the TXNIP/NLRP3/GSDMD pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35609679/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a dearth of effective pharmacotherapies for sepsis-induced acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) to which oxidative stress and excessive inflammation are major contributors. We hypothesized that fudosteine, a cysteine derivative, may protect against sepsis-induced ALI/ARDS given its anti-oxidant capacity. This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of fudosteine in a mouse model of sepsis-induced ALI. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The intragastrical administration of fudosteine (25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased proinflammatory cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum and reduced BALF/serum albumin and lung wet/dry weight ratios in septic mice. The lung injury score was significantly lowered by fudosteine [&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, 0.18 ± 0.03 (100 mg/kg) vs. 0.42 ± 0.03 (CLP), &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001]. Fudosteine also reduced the biomarkers of lung epithelial injury in BALF and markedly improved oxidative stress indicators in lung tissues [&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, malondialdehyde: 337.70 ± 23.78 (100 mg/kg) vs. 686.40 ± 28.36 (CLP) nmol/mg protein, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001]. Lung tissue transcriptomics analyses revealed suppressed inflammatory responses and oxidative stress with fudosteine and the involvement of the inflammasome and pyroptosis pathways. Western blot analyses indicated that fudosteine inhibited the sepsis-induced activation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) and caspase-1 and the upregulation of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3), and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC). Fudosteine therefore protects against sepsis-induced ALI in mice, and the inhibition of pyroptosis via the TXNIP/NLRP3/GSDMD pathway may be an underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Myocardial infarction (MI) in diabetic patients results in higher mortality and morbidity. We and others have previously shown that bone marrow-endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote cardiac neovascularization and attenuate ischemic injury. Lately, small extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as major paracrine effectors mediating the benefits of stem cell therapy. Modest clinical outcomes of autologous cell-based therapies suggest diabetes-induced EPC dysfunction and may also reflect their EV derivatives. Moreover, studies suggest that post-translational histone modifications promote diabetes-induced vascular dysfunctions. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that diabetic EPC-EVs may lose their post-injury cardiac reparative function by modulating histone modification in endothelial cells (ECs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We collected EVs from the culture medium of EPCs isolated from non-diabetic (db/+) and diabetic (db/db) mice and examined their effects on recipient ECs and cardiomyocytes &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and their reparative function in permanent ligation of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) myocardial ischemic injuries &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared to db/+ EPC-EVs, db/db EPC-EVs promoted EC and cardiomyocyte apoptosis and repressed tube-forming capacity of ECs. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, db/db EPC-EVs depressed cardiac function, reduced capillary density, and increased fibrosis compared to db/+ EPC-EV treatments after MI. Moreover, in the I/R MI model, db/+ EPC-EV-mediated acute cardio-protection was lost with db/db EPC-EVs, and db/db EPC-EVs increased immune cell infiltration, infarct area, and plasma cardiac troponin-I. Mechanistically, histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) was significantly decreased in cardiac ECs treated with db/db EPC-EVs compared to db/+ EPC-EVs. The H3K9Ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) results further revealed that db/db EPC-EVs reduced H3K9Ac level on angiogenic, cell survival, and proliferative genes in cardiac ECs. We found that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, valproic acid (VPA), partly restored diabetic EPC-EV-impaired H3K9Ac levels, tube formation and viability of ECs, and enhanced cell survival and proliferative genes, &lt;em&gt;Pdgfd&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sox12&lt;/em&gt;, expression. Moreover, we observed that VPA treatment improved db/db EPC-mediated post-MI cardiac repair and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings unravel that diabetes impairs EPC-EV reparative function in the ischemic heart, at least partially, through HDACs-mediated H3K9Ac downregulation leading to transcriptional suppression of angiogenic, proliferative and cell survival genes in recipient cardiac ECs. Thus, HDAC inhibitors may potentially be used to restore the function of diabetic EPC and other stem cells for autologous cell therapy applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhaled Marijuana and the Lung</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although vaping has recently increased as a mode of inhaling marijuana and has been associated with numerous and sometimes fatal cases of acute severe lung injury, smoking remains the most common method of inhaling marijuana and has been studied more extensively. Smoking marijuana has been shown to produce modest but significant short-term bronchodilation both in healthy subjects and in those with asthma. Long-term effects of habitual marijuana smoking include the following: (1) symptoms of chronic bronchitis (increased cough, sputum production, and wheezing); (2) modest effects on lung function in cross-sectional studies (no significant decrease in FEV1 but mild reductions in FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio, an increase in forced vital capacity and other lung volumes, reductions in specific airway conductance, and variable effects of maximal midexpiratory flow rates and diffusing capacity); and (3) variable effects on age-related decline in FEV1 in longitudinal studies. Most cohort and case-control studies have failed to show that marijuana smoking is a significant risk factor for lung cancer despite the presence of procarcinogenic components in marijuana smoke, although further study is warranted. The question whether marijuana smoking is associated with asthma is unclear and requires further investigation. Although delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, the principal psychoactive component of marijuana, has immunomodulatory properties that hypothetically could increase the risk of pneumonia, the few available studies in marijuana smokers have failed to find an increased risk of pneumonia in immunocompetent users, although effects in immunosuppressed individuals have been variable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of the AMPK-ULK1 pathway mediated protective autophagy by sevoflurane anesthesia restrains LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevoflurane alleviates LPS-induced ALI by activating cell protective autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevoflurane triggers protective autophagy by activating AMPK/ULK1/PIKFYVE pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevoflurane restrains LPS-induced ALI via AMPK/ULK1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Sevoflurane anesthesia is deemed as potential therapeutic drug for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI), but the molecular mechanisms have not been fully delineated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim:&lt;/em&gt; The present study explored the specific molecular mechanism of sevoflurane regulating autophagy to reduce LPS induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male C57BL/6J mice and mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (MPVECs) were treated with LPS to construct ALI models, and the levels of inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy were detected after treatment with sevoflurane. Meanwhile, cells were treated with autophagy inhibitor or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) pathway inhibitor in vitro to detect their effects on cell survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Sevoflurane reduced inflammation, recovered cell division so as to suppress cell apoptosis and maintain cell survival, and activated autophagic flux in LPS-induced ALI models in vivo and in vitro. Of note, the suppressing effects of sevoflurane on LPS-induced cell death were abrogated by inhibiting autophagy. Moreover, we evidenced that sevoflurane promoted activation of the AMPK/ULK1 pathway in LPS-induced ALI models. Blockage of this pathway abrogated the promoting effects of sevoflurane on cell autophagy and cell viability in LPS-treated cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, sevoflurane suppresses apoptosis and inflammation via activating protective autophagy, thereby ameliorating LPS-induced ALI, and the AMPK/ULK1/ PIKFYVE pathway is responsible for the process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Malondialdehyde Acetaldehyde-Adduction Changes Surfactant Protein D Structure and Function</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35669781/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption with concurrent cigarette smoking produces malondialdehyde acetaldehyde (MAA)-adducted lung proteins. Lung surfactant protein D (SPD) supports innate immunity via bacterial aggregation and lysis, as well as by enhancing macrophage-binding and phagocytosis. MAA-adducted SPD (SPD-MAA) has negative effects on lung cilia beating, macrophage function, and epithelial cell injury repair. Because changes in SPD multimer structure are known to impact SPD function, we hypothesized that MAA-adduction changes both SPD structure and function. Purified human SPD and SPD-MAA (1 mg/mL) were resolved by gel filtration using Sephadex G-200 and protein concentration of each fraction determined by Bradford assay. Fractions were immobilized onto nitrocellulose by slot blot and assayed by Western blot using antibodies to SPD and to MAA. Binding of SPD and SPD-MAA was determined fluorometrically using GFP-labeled &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; (GFP-SP). Anti-bacterial aggregation of GFP-SP and macrophage bacterial phagocytosis were assayed by microscopy and permeability determined by bacterial phosphatase release. Viral injury was measured as LDH release in RSV-treated airway epithelial cells. Three sizes of SPD were resolved by gel chromatography as monomeric, trimeric, and multimeric forms. SPD multimer was the most prevalent, while the majority of SPD-MAA eluted as trimer and monomer. SPD dose-dependently bound to GFP-SP, but SPD-MAA binding to bacteria was significantly reduced. SPD enhanced, but MAA adduction of SPD prevented, both aggregation and macrophage phagocytosis of GFP-SP. Likewise, SPD increased bacterial permeability while SPD-MAA did not. In the presence of RSV, BEAS-2B cell viability was enhanced by SPD, but not protected by SPD-MAA. Our results demonstrate that MAA adduction changes the quaternary structure of SPD from multimer to trimer and monomer leading to a decrease in the native anti-microbial function of SPD. These findings suggest one mechanism for increased pneumonia observed in alcohol use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NecroX-5 ameliorates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via inhibiting NLRP3-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35596212/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and usually lethal pulmonary disease. Despite considerable research efforts, no effective therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis has been developed. NecroX-5 has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-tumor activities. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether NecroX-5 exhibits antifibrotic property in bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that pre-treatment with NecroX-5 alleviated inflammatory response, reduced oxidative stress, inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. Our data further indicated that NecroX-5 substantially reduced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, NLRP3 overexpression significantly reversed the protective effects of NecroX-5 in lung epithelial cells exposed to BLM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Overall, our results demonstrate the potent antifibrotic properties of NecroX-5 and its therapeutic potential for pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Characterization of Immunopathology and Small Airway Remodeling in Constrictive Bronchiolitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35550018/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35550018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Constrictive bronchiolitis (ConB) is a relatively rare and understudied form of lung disease whose underlying immunopathology remains incompletely defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; Our objectives were to quantify specific pathological features that differentiate ConB from other diseases that affect the small airways and to investigate the underlying immune and inflammatory phenotype present in ConB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We performed a comparative histomorphometric analysis of small airways in lung biopsy samples collected from 50 soldiers with postdeployment ConB, 8 patients with sporadic ConB, 55 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 25 nondiseased control subjects. We measured immune and inflammatory gene expression in lung tissue using the NanoString nCounter Immunology Panel from six control subjects, six soldiers with ConB, and six patients with sporadic ConB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with control subjects, we found shared pathological changes in small airways from soldiers with postdeployment ConB and patients with sporadic ConB, including increased thickness of the smooth muscle layer, increased collagen deposition in the subepithelium, and lymphocyte infiltration. Using principal-component analysis, we showed that ConB pathology was clearly separable both from control lungs and from small airway disease associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. NanoString gene expression analysis from lung tissue revealed T-cell activation in both groups of patients with ConB with upregulation of proinflammatory pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB) signaling, TLR (Toll-like receptor) signaling, T-cell receptor signaling, and antigen processing and presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings indicate shared immunopathology among different forms of ConB and suggest that an ongoing T-helper cell type 1-type adaptive immune response underlies airway wall remodeling in ConB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>miR-142-5p Encapsulated by Serum-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Protects against Acute Lung Injury in Septic Rats following Remote Ischemic Preconditioning via the PTEN/PI3K/Akt Axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35588695/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study intends to investigate the effects of miR-142-5p encapsulated by serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) on septic acute lung injury (ALI) following remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) through a PTEN-involved mechanism. ALI was induced in rats by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, 24 h before which RIPC was performed via the left lower limb. Next, the binding affinity between miR-142-5p and PTEN was identified. EVs were isolated from serum and injected into rats. The morphology of lung tissues, pulmonary edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration into lung tissues were then assessed, and TNF-α and IL-6 levels in serum and lung tissues were measured. The results indicated that RIPC could attenuate ALI in sepsis. miR-142-5p expression was increased in serum, lung tissues, and serum-derived EVs of ALI rats following RIPC. miR-142-5p could target PTEN to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. miR-142-5p shuttled by serum-derived EVs reduced pulmonary edema, neutrophil infiltration, and TNF-α and IL-6 levels, thus alleviating ALI in LPS-induced septic rats upon RIPC. Collectively, serum-derived EVs-loaded miR-142-5p downregulated PTEN and activated PI3K/Akt to inhibit ALI in sepsis following RIPC, thus highlighting potential therapeutic molecular targets against ALI in sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Combinational benefit of antihistamines and remdesivir for reducing SARS-CoV-2 replication and alleviating inflammation-induced lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35503561/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the combination of anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapy is predicted to provide clinical benefits. We recently demonstrated that mast cells (MCs) are an essential mediator of SARS-CoV-2-initiated hyperinflammation. We also showed that spike protein-induced MC degranulation initiates alveolar epithelial inflammation for barrier disruption and suggested an off-label use of antihistamines as MC stabilizers to block degranulation and consequently suppress inflammation and prevent lung injury. In this study, we emphasized the essential role of MCs in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung lesions in vivo, and demonstrated the benefits of co-administration of antihistamines and antiviral drug remdesivir in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-induced MC degranulation resulted in alveolar-capillary injury, while pretreatment of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells with antihistamines prevented adhesion junction disruption; predictably, the combination of antiviral drug remdesivir with the antihistamine loratadine, a histamine receptor 1 (HR1) antagonist, dampened viral replication and inflammation, thereby greatly reducing lung injury. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of MCs in SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and lung injury and provide a feasible combination antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapy for COVID-19 treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evolving Concepts in Endothelial Pathobiology of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35582968/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a deadly disease, characterized by increased vascular resistance, pulmonary arteriolar loss, and occlusive arterial remodeling, leading to eventual right heart failure. Evidence increasingly points to the pulmonary endothelium as a central actor in PAH. Endothelial cell apoptosis can result directly in distal lung arteriolar pruning and indirectly in the formation of complex and occlusive arterial lesions, reflecting an imbalance between endothelial injury and repair in the development and progression of PAH. Many of the mutations implicated in PAH are in genes, which are predominantly, or solely, expressed in endothelial cells, and the endothelium is a major target for therapeutic interventions to restore BMP signaling. We explore how arterial pruning can promote the emergence of occlusive arterial remodeling mediated by ongoing endothelial injury secondary to hemodynamic perturbation and pathological increases in luminal shear stress. The emerging role of endothelial cell senescence is discussed in the transition from reversible to irreversible arterial remodeling in advanced PAH, and we review the sometimes conflicting evidence that female sex hormones can both protect or promote vascular changes in disease. Finally, we explore the contribution of the endothelium to metabolic changes and the altered inflammatory and immune state in the PAH lung, focusing on the role of excessive TGFβ signaling. Given the complexity of the endothelial pathobiology of PAH, we anticipate that emerging technologies that allow the study of molecular events at a single cell level will provide answers to many of the questions raised in this review.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Isoliquiritin apioside relieves intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute lung injury by blocking Hif-1α-mediated ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35597117/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IA lightened intestinal I/R-induced injury, inflammation and ferroptosis in lung tissues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hif-1α activation promoted lung epithelial ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hif-1α activation abolished the effect of IA on H/R-induced lung epithelial ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isoliquiritin apioside (IA), a critical ingredient of Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma, has been unveiled to possess remarkable pharmacological activity against oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the potential roles of IA in intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) have not been reported yet. In the present study, we explored the effects of IA on I/R-induced ALI, and also clarified the possible mechanisms. To mimic intestinal I/R-induced ALI, the mice were subjected to 60 min of intestinal ischemia via clamping of the superior mesenteric artery followed by 60 min of reperfusion. IA was administered orally (20 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day) for 7 consecutive days before intestinal I/R. Lung epithelial MLE-2 cells were subjected to hypoxia for 2 h and regeneration for 3 h to mimic in vitro ALI. The results showed that IA administration prevented intestinal I/R-induced lung injury, inflammation and edema. Also, IA administration decreased the level of ferroptosis in murine lung tissues challenged with intestinal I/R. In terms of mechanism, IA administration inhibited the protein upregulation of Hif-1α and HO-1 in mice with ALI. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that IA treatment could inhibit the mRNA and protein levels of Hif-1α in hypoxia/regeneration (H/R)-induced MLE-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Hif-1α stabilizer molidustat itself also significantly promoted ferroptosis of MLE-2 cells. And Hif-1α activation increased the mRNA levels of Ptgs2 and Acsl4 but decreased the mRNA level of Gpx4 in H/R-induced MLE-2 cells treated with IA. Taken together, our study unveiled IA could protect against intestinal I/R-induced ALI by decreasing lung epithelial ferroptosis in a Hif-1α-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-29a-3p Improves Acute Lung Injury by Reducing Alveolar Epithelial Cell PANoptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35656115/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alveolar epithelial cell damage is an important determinant of the severity of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). However, the molecular mechanisms of alveolar epithelial death during the development of ALI/ARDS remain unclear. In this study, we explore the role of miR-29a-3p in ALI/ARDS and its molecular mechanism. Plasma samples were collected from healthy controls and ARDS patients. Mice were intratracheally instilled with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish acute lung injury. N6-adenosine (m6A) quantification, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, cell viability assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting were performed. We found that miR-29a-3p was down-regulated in plasma of ARDS patients and lung tissue of ALI model mice, and miR-29a-3p agomir injection down-regulated the levels of the inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the lungs, reducing alveolar epithelial cell PANoptosis as evaluated by the downregulation of Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), gasdermin D (GSDMD), caspase-3, caspase-8, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), ultimately improving lung injury in the ALI model mice. Mechanism studies demonstrated that the knockout of methyltransferase 3 (N6-adenosine-methyltransferase complex catalytic subunit) removed the m6A modification of miR-29a-3p and reduced miR-29a-3p expression. Our findings suggest that miR-29a-3p is a potential target that can be manipulated for ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explosion-induced injury is the most commonly encountered wound in modern warfare and incidents. The vascular inflammatory response and subsequent oxidative stress are considered the key causes of morbidity and mortality among those in blast lung injury. It has been reported dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) plays important roles in regulating vascular endothelial injury repair and angiogenesis, but its role in explosion-induced injury remains to be explained. To explore the mechanism of vascular injury in blast lung, 40 C57BL/6 wild type mice and 40 DDAH1 knockout mice were randomly equally divided into control group and blast group, respectively. Body weight, lung weight, and dry weight of the lungs were recorded. Diffuse vascular leakage was detected by Evans blue test. The serum inflammatory factors, nitric oxide (NO) contents, and ADMA level were determined through ELISA. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and ROS detection were performed for histopathological changes. Western blot was used to detect the proteins related to oxidative stress, cell adhesion molecules and leukocyte transendothelial migration, vascular injury, endothelial barrier dysfunction, and the DDAH1/ADMA/eNOS signaling pathway. We found that DDAH1 deficiency aggravated explosion-induced body weight reduction, lung weight promotion, diffuse vascular leakage histopathological changes, and the increased levels of inflammatory-related factors. Additionally, DDAH1 deficiency also increased ROS generation, MDA, and IRE-1α expression. Regarding vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction, DDAH1 deficiency increased the expression of ICAM-1, Itgal, Rac2, VEGF, MMP9, vimentin, and N-cadherin, while lowering the expression of occludin, CD31, and dystrophin. DDAH1 deficiency also exacerbated explosion-induced increase of ADMA and decrease of eNOS activity and NO contents. Our results indicated that explosion could induce severe lung injury and pulmonary vascular insufficiency, whereas DDAH1 could promote lung endothelial barrier repair and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress by inhibiting ADMA signaling which in turn increased eNOS activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure to PM2.5 could induce the generation of oxidative stress in the lung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 elicited the recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes to lung alveoli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure to PM2.5 induced lung injury and the production of inflammatory proteins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N-acetylcysteine attenuated PM2.5-induced ROS production and lung inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced ROS generation attenuated neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes recruitment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Exposure to particulate matter (PM) may contribute to lung inflammation and injury. The therapeutic effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a well-known antioxidant, with regards to the prevention and treatment of fine PM (PM2.5)-induced lung injury is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the effect of PM2.5 on the recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes into lung alveoli and the production of proinflammatory proteins by stimulating the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and to investigate the therapeutic effect of NAC on PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a single administration of PM2.5 (200 μg/100 μl/mouse) or phosphate-buffered saline (control) via intratracheal instillation. The mice were injected intratracheally via a microsprayer aerosolizer with NAC (20 or 40 mg/kg) 1 h before PM2.5 instillation and 24 h after PM2.5 instillation. Total protein, VEGF, IL-6, and TNF-α in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured. Oxidative stress was evaluated by determining levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite in BALF. Flow cytometric analysis was used to identify and quantify neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; and Ly6C&lt;sub&gt;low&lt;/sub&gt; monocyte subsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Neutrophil count, total protein, and VEGF content in BALF significantly increased after PM2.5 exposure and reached the highest level on day 2. Increased levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, nitrite, and MDA in BALF were also noted. Flow cytometric analysis showed increased recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;, but not Ly6C&lt;sub&gt;low&lt;/sub&gt; monocytes, into lung alveoli. Treatment with NAC via the intratracheal spray significantly attenuated the recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes into lung alveoli in PM2.5-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, NAC significantly attenuated the production of total protein, VEGF, nitrite, and MDA in the mice with PM2.5-induced lung injury in a dose-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; PM2.5-induced lung injury caused by the generation of oxidative stress led to the recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes, and production of inflammatory proteins. NAC treatment alleviated PM2.5-induced lung injury by attenuating the ROS-mediated recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes and lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Relationship between impaired BMP signalling and clinical risk factors at early-stage vascular injury in the preterm infant</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35580897/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic lung disease, that is, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication in preterm infants and develops as a consequence of the misguided formation of the gas-exchange area undergoing prenatal and postnatal injury. Subsequent vascular disease and its progression into pulmonary arterial hypertension critically determines long-term outcome in the BPD infant but lacks identification of early, disease-defining changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We link impaired bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling to the earliest onset of vascular pathology in the human preterm lung and delineate the specific effects of the most prevalent prenatal and postnatal clinical risk factors for lung injury mimicking clinically relevant conditions in a multilayered animal model using wild-type and transgenic neonatal mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrate (1) the significant reduction in BMP receptor 2 (BMPR2) expression at the onset of vascular pathology in the lung of preterm infants, later mirrored by reduced plasma BMP protein levels in infants with developing BPD, (2) the rapid impairment (and persistent change) of BMPR2 signalling on postnatal exposure to hyperoxia and mechanical ventilation, aggravated by prenatal cigarette smoke in a preclinical mouse model and (3) a link to defective alveolar septation and matrix remodelling through platelet derived growth factor-receptor alpha deficiency. In a treatment approach, we partially reversed vascular pathology by BMPR2-targeted treatment with FK506 in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We identified impaired BMP signalling as a hallmark of early vascular disease in the injured neonatal lung while outlining its promising potential as a future biomarker or therapeutic target in this growing, high-risk patient population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel small molecule Hsp90 inhibitor, C-316-1, attenuates acute kidney injury by suppressing RIPK1-mediated inflammation and necroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35588657/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is marked by a fast deterioration of the kidney function that may be caused by a variety of factors and there is still no effective treatment for AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A novel small molecule Hsp90 inhibitor, C-316-1, prevented necroptosis and inflammation in cisplatin- and ischemia/reperfusion-induced in vitro and in vivo via binding with R46, E47 and S50 in Cdc37 binding site of Hsp90.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C-316-1 is a novel Hsp90 inhibitor with high efficiency in treatment of AKI and Hsp90 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is marked by a fast deterioration of the kidney function that may be caused by a variety of factors. Recently, although our group found that PPBICA alleviated programmed cell death in AKI, poor water solubility limited its bioavailability. In this research, we screened a series of derivatives and found that C-316-1 had the best suppressive effect on preventing necroptosis and inflammation in cisplatin- and ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI in vitro and in vivo with lower toxicity and better water solubility. Mass spectrometry results showed that C-316-1 bound to heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), which was further confirmed by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance. Additionally, the Hsp90 expression was upregulated in the blood and tissues of AKI patients. We discovered that C-316-1 decreased the RIPK1 protein level without affecting its mRNA expression. The proteasome inhibitor, MG132 restored the level of RIPK1 reduced by C-316-1, suggesting that C-316-1 limits necroptosis by promoting the degradation of RIPK1 rather than by reducing its production. Immunoprecipitation further showed that pretreatment with C-316-1 disrupted the Hsp90-Cdc37 protein-protein Interactions (PPIs). Thereby, C-316-1 inhibited the Hsp90-Cdc37 complex formation and led to a significant decrease in RIPK1, which in turn reduced necroptosis. Moreover, C-316-1 treatment did not protect against kidney injury in vivo and in vitro when Hsp90 was knocked down and R46, E47, and S50 in Cdc37 binding site of Hsp90 might form an important active pocket with C-316-1. These findings suggest that C-316-1 is a potential therapeutic agent against RIPK1-Mediated Necroptosis in AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HDAC6 modulates myofibril stiffness and diastolic function of the heart</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35575093/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passive stiffness of the heart is determined largely by extracellular matrix and titin, which functions as a molecular spring within sarcomeres. Titin stiffening is associated with the development of diastolic dysfunction (DD), while augmented titin compliance appears to impair systolic performance in dilated cardiomyopathy. We found that myofibril stiffness was elevated in mice lacking histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Cultured adult murine ventricular myocytes treated with a selective HDAC6 inhibitor also exhibited increased myofibril stiffness. Conversely, HDAC6 overexpression in cardiomyocytes led to decreased myofibril stiffness, as did ex vivo treatment of mouse, rat, and human myofibrils with recombinant HDAC6. Modulation of myofibril stiffness by HDAC6 was dependent on 282 amino acids encompassing a portion of the PEVK element of titin. HDAC6 colocalized with Z-disks, and proteomics analysis suggested that HDAC6 functions as a sarcomeric protein deacetylase. Finally, increased myofibril stiffness in HDAC6-deficient mice was associated with exacerbated DD in response to hypertension or aging. These findings define a role for a deacetylase in the control of myofibril function and myocardial passive stiffness, suggest that reversible acetylation alters titin compliance, and reveal the potential of targeting HDAC6 to manipulate the elastic properties of the heart to treat cardiac diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MicroRNAs: Important Regulatory Molecules in Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35628354/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an overactivated inflammatory response caused by direct or indirect injuries that destroy lung parenchymal cells and dramatically reduce lung function. Although some research progress has been made in recent years, the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS remains unclear due to its heterogeneity and etiology. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a type of small noncoding RNA, play a vital role in various diseases. In ALI/ARDS, miRNAs can regulate inflammatory and immune responses by targeting specific molecules. Regulation of miRNA expression can reduce damage and promote the recovery of ALI/ARDS. Consequently, miRNAs are considered as potential diagnostic indicators and therapeutic targets of ALI/ARDS. Given that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS, we review the miRNAs involved in the inflammatory process of ALI/ARDS to provide new ideas for the pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis, and treatment of ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pulmonary and Neurologic Effects of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Extracellular Vesicles in a Multifactorial Lung Injury Model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35286238/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic respiratory condition originating from preterm birth, is associated with abnormal neurodevelopment. Currently, there is an absence of effective therapies for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and its associated brain injury. In preclinical trials, mesenchymal stromal cell therapies demonstrate promise as a therapeutic alternative for bronchopulmonary dysplasia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate whether a multifactorial neonatal mouse model of lung injury perturbs neural progenitor cell function and to assess the ability of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles to mitigate pulmonary and neurologic injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mice at Postnatal Day 7 or 8 were injected intraperitoneally with LPS and ventilated with 40% oxygen at Postnatal Day 9 or 10 for 8 hours. Treated animals received umbilical cord-mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles intratracheally preceding ventilation. Lung morphology, vascularity, and inflammation were quantified. Neural progenitor cells were isolated from the subventricular zone and hippocampus and assessed for self-renewal, &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; differentiation ability, and transcriptional profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/em&gt; The multifactorial lung injury model produced alveolar and vascular rarefaction mimicking bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Neural progenitor cells from lung injury mice showed reduced neurosphere and oligodendrocyte formation, as well as inflammatory transcriptional signatures. Mice treated with mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles showed significant improvement in lung architecture, vessel formation, and inflammatory modulation. In addition, we observed significantly increased &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; neurosphere formation and altered neural progenitor cell transcriptional signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our multifactorial lung injury model impairs neural progenitor cell function. Observed pulmonary and neurologic alterations are mitigated by intratracheal treatment with mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metformin Regulates Alveolar Macrophage Polarization to Protect Against Acute Lung Injury in Rats Caused by Paraquat Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35645808/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study explored the role of metformin (MET) in regulating the polarization of alveolar macrophages to protect against acute lung injury (ALI) in rats caused by paraquat (PQ) poisoning. The &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; studies showed that the 35 mg/kg dose of MET increased the survival rate of rats, alleviated pathological damages to the lungs and their systemic inflammation, promoted the reduction of the pro-inflammatory factors interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels, and increased the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 levels in the rat serum. At the same time, the MET intervention decreased the expression of M1 macrophage marker iNOS in the lungs of the PQ-poisoned rats while increasing the M2 macrophage marker, Arg1, expression. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, the concentration of MET &amp;gt; 10 mmol/L affected NR8383 viability adversely and was concentration-dependent; however, no adverse impact on NR8383 viability was observed at MET ≤ 10 mmol/L concentration, resisting the reducing effect of PQ on NR8383 vitality. The PQ-induced NR8383 model with MET intervention showed significantly reduced secretions of IL-6 and TNF-α in NR8383, and lowered expressions of M1 macrophage markers iNOS and CD86. Additionally, MET increased IL-10 secretion and the M2 macrophage markers, Arg1 and Mrcl, expressions. Therefore, we speculate that MET could regulate alveolar macrophage polarization to protect against PQ-poisoning caused ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 exposure can cause lung injury and a large number of respiratory disorders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sipeimine ameliorated lung injury caused by PM2.5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sipeimine decreased ferroptosis in type II alveolar epithelial cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effects of sipeimine were mediated through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure can cause lung injury and a large number of respiratory diseases. Sipeimine is a steroidal alkaloid isolated from Fritillaria roylei which has been associated with anti-inflammatory, antitussive and antiasthmatic properties. In this study, we explored the potential effects of sipeimine against PM2.5-induced lung injury in Sprague Dawley rats. Sipeimine alleviated lung injury caused by PM2.5 and decreased pulmonary edema, inflammation and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In addition, sipeimine upregulated the glutathione (GSH) expression and downregulated the expression of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), tissue iron and malondialdehyde (MDA). The downregulation of proteins involved in ferroptosis, including nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) was reversed by sipeimine. The administration of RSL3, a potent ferroptosis-triggering agent, blocked the effects of sipeimine. Using network pharmacology, we found that the effects of sipeimine were presumably mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway. A PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) blocked the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and reversed the effects of sipeimine. Overall, this study suggested that the protective effect of sipeimine against PM2.5-induced lung injury was mainly mediated through the PI3K/Akt pathway, ultimately leading to a reduction in ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nitrated fatty acid, 10-nitrooleate protects against hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intratracheal administration of 10-nitrooleate inhibits hyperoxia-induced inflammation and alveolar permeability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10-nitrooleate modulates the antioxidant pathway and restores the hyperoxia-induced lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10-nitrooleate reversed the hyperoxia-induced expression of mitophagy-associated markers and protected the lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of electrophilic nitrated fatty acid (NFA); 10-nitrooleate, have been reported. The present study investigated whether 10-nitrooleate has a protective role against hyperoxic-induced acute lung injury (HALI). Using a C57BL/6 mice model of HALI, we investigated the protective effect of 10-nitrooleate. C57BL/6 mice were administered with NFA intratracheally, exposed to hyperoxia for 48 h to induce HALI, and kept at room air for 24 h. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung samples were collected after 24 h of post hyperoxia to analyze markers associated with HALI. Intratracheal (IT) and intraperitoneal (IP) administration of NFA notably attenuated hyperoxia-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, alveolar-capillary leakage, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6 and TNFα) into the BAL fluid, and resolution of inflammation in the lung. Western blot analyses showed that 10-nitrooleate reduced the expression of the inflammatory transcription factor NFκB p65 subunit and increased antioxidant proteins HO-1 and NQO1 expression in the lung tissues compared to vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, 10-nitrooleate reversed the hyperoxia-induced expression of mitophagy-associated markers (PINK1 and p62/SQSTM1), thereby protecting the HALI/ acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). IT and IP delivery of 10-nitrooleate reduces hyperoxia-induced ALI/ARDS by regulating the antioxidant pathways and restoring the mitochondrial homeostasis by regulating mitophagy. It is suggested that NFAs can be further evaluated as supplementary therapy for critically ill patients like COVID-19/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Patulin Induces Acute Kidney Injury in Mice through Autophagy-Ferroptosis Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35543324/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patulin (PAT) is a common mycotoxin, widely found in cereals, seafood, nuts, and especially in fruits and their products. Exposure to this mycotoxin has been reported to induce kidney injury. However, the possible mechanism remains unclear. In our study, short-term high-dose intake of PAT caused acute kidney injury (AKI) in mice. We performed high-throughput transcriptional sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the treatment and control groups. The ferroptosis signaling pathway had the highest enrichment, suggesting ferroptosis is involved in PAT-induced AKI. Further, the existence of ferroptosis and autophagy was confirmed by observing the changes of mitochondria morphology and the formation of autophagosomes by electron microscopy. And the expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), p62, nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) were downregulated, whereas acyl-CoA synthase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), transferrin (TF), LC3, and ferritin light chain (FTL) expression were upregulated in PAT-exposed mice. These results suggested autophagy-dependent ferroptosis occurred in the animal model. This view has also been confirmed in the human renal tubular epithelial cell (HKC) experiments. Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA) attenuated PAT-induced ferroptosis and the iron contents in HKC cells. Simultaneous autophagy-dependent ferroptosis can be inhibited by ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and desferrioxamine (DFO). In general, this study provides a new perspective for exploring the new mechanism of acute kidney injury caused by PAT.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SEC is an antiangiogenic virulence factor that promotes Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis independent of superantigen activity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35544579/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin C (SEC) is critical for &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; infective endocarditis (SAIE) in rabbits. Superantigenicity, its hallmark function, was proposed to be a major underlying mechanism driving SAIE but was not directly tested. With the use of S. aureus MW2 expressing SEC toxoids, we show that superantigenicity does not sufficiently account for vegetation growth, myocardial inflammation, and acute kidney injury in the rabbit model of native valve SAIE. These results highlight the critical contribution of an alternative function of superantigens to SAIE. In support of this, we provide evidence that SEC exerts antiangiogenic effects by inhibiting branching microvessel formation in an ex vivo rabbit aortic ring model and by inhibiting endothelial cell expression of one of the most potent mediators of angiogenesis, VEGF-A. SEC&amp;rsquo;s ability to interfere with tissue revascularization and remodeling after injury serves as a mechanism to promote SAIE and its life-threatening systemic pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles enclosed-miR-421 suppresses air pollution (PM2.5)-induced cardiac dysfunction via ACE2 signalling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35536587/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollution, via ambient PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, is a big threat to public health since it associates with increased hospitalisation, incidence rate and mortality of cardiopulmonary injury. However, the potential mediators of pulmonary injury in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced cardiovascular disorder are not fully understood. To investigate a potential cross talk between lung and heart upon PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, intratracheal instillation in vivo, organ culture ex vivo and human bronchial epithelial cells (Beas-2B) culture in vitro experiments were performed respectively. The exposed supernatants of Beas-2B were collected to treat primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Upon intratracheal instillation, subacute PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure caused cardiac dysfunction, which was time-dependent secondary to lung injury in mice, thereby demonstrating a cross-talk between lungs and heart potentially mediated via small extracellular vesicles (sEV). We isolated sEV from PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed mice serum and Beas-2B supernatants to analyse the change of sEV subpopulations in response to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;. Single particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensing analysis (SP-IRIS) demonstrated that PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; increased CD63/CD81/CD9 positive particles. Our results indicated that respiratory system-derived sEV containing miR-421 contributed to cardiac dysfunction post-PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Inhibition of miR-421 by AAV9-miR421-sponge could significantly reverse PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced cardiac dysfunction in mice. We identified that cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was a downstream target of sEV-miR421, and induced myocardial cell apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction. In addition, we observed that GW4869 (an inhibitor of sEV release) or diminazene aceturate (DIZE, an activator of ACE2) treatment could attenuate PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure promotes sEV-linked miR421 release after lung injury and hereby contributes to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced cardiac dysfunction via suppressing ACE2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myeloid CCR2 Promotes Atherosclerosis after AKI</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35537780/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The risk of cardiovascular events rises after AKI. Leukocytes promote atherosclerotic plaque growth and instability. We established a model of enhanced remote atherosclerosis after renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and investigated the underlying inflammatory mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Atherosclerotic lesions and inflammation were investigated in native and bone marrow-transplanted LDL receptor-deficient (&lt;em&gt;LDLr&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice after unilateral renal IR injury using histology, flow cytometry, and gene expression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Aortic root atherosclerotic lesions were significantly larger after renal IR injury than in controls. A gene expression screen revealed enrichment for chemokines and their cognate receptors in aortas of IR-injured mice in early atherosclerosis, and of T cell-associated genes in advanced disease. Confocal microscopy revealed increased aortic macrophage proximity to T cells. Differential aortic inflammatory gene regulation in IR-injured mice largely paralleled the pattern in the injured kidney. Single-cell analysis identified renal cell types that produced soluble mediators upregulated in the atherosclerotic aorta. The analysis revealed a marked early increase in &lt;em&gt;Ccl2&lt;/em&gt;, which CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; myeloid cells mainly expressed. CCR2 mediated myeloid cell homing to the post-ischemic kidney in a cell-individual manner. Reconstitution with &lt;em&gt;Ccr2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; bone marrow dampened renal post-ischemic inflammation, reduced aortic &lt;em&gt;Ccl2&lt;/em&gt; and inflammatory macrophage marker CD11c, and abrogated excess aortic atherosclerotic plaque formation after renal IR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our data introduce an experimental model of remote proatherogenic effects of renal IR and delineate myeloid CCR2 signaling as a mechanistic requirement. Monocytes should be considered as mobile mediators when addressing systemic vascular sequelae of kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myeloid Poldip2 Contributes to the Development of Pulmonary Inflammation by Regulating Neutrophil Adhesion in a Murine Model of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35535614/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35535614/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Lung injury, a severe adverse outcome of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome, is attributed to excessive neutrophil recruitment and effector response. Poldip2 (polymerase δ-interacting protein 2) plays a critical role in regulating endothelial permeability and leukocyte recruitment in acute inflammation. Thus, we hypothesized that &lt;em&gt;myeloid&lt;/em&gt; Poldip2 is involved in neutrophil recruitment to inflamed lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and Results:&lt;/em&gt; After characterizing myeloid-specific &lt;em&gt;Poldip2&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice, we showed that at 18 hours post-lipopolysaccharide injection, bronchoalveolar lavage from myeloid Poldip2-deficient mice contained fewer inflammatory cells (8 [4-16] versus 29 [12-57]×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/mL in wild-type mice) and a smaller percentage of neutrophils (30% [28%-34%] versus 38% [33%-41%] in wild-type mice), while the main chemoattractants for neutrophils remained unaffected. In vitro, Poldip2-deficient neutrophils responded as well as wild-type neutrophils to inflammatory stimuli with respect to neutrophil extracellular trap formation, reactive oxygen species production, and induction of cytokines. However, neutrophil adherence to a tumor necrosis factor-α stimulated endothelial monolayer was inhibited by Poldip2 depletion (225 [115-272] wild-type [myePoldip2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;] versus 133 [62-178] myeloid-specific &lt;em&gt;Poldip2&lt;/em&gt; knockout [myePoldip2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;] neutrophils) as was transmigration (1.7 [1.3-2.1] versus 1.1 [1.0-1.4] relative to baseline transmigration). To determine the underlying mechanism, we examined the surface expression of β2-integrin, its binding to soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and Pyk2 phosphorylation. Surface expression of β2-integrins was not affected by Poldip2 deletion, whereas β2-integrins and Pyk2 were less activated in Poldip2-deficient neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These results suggest that myeloid Poldip2 is involved in β2-integrin activation during the inflammatory response, which in turn mediates neutrophil-to-endothelium adhesion in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil extracellular traps mediate m6A modification and regulates sepsis-associated acute lung injury by activating ferroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35637949/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) production is a major strategy employed by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) to fight against microbes. NETs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various lung injuries, although few studies have explored NETs in sepsis-associated acute lung injury (SI-ALI). Here, we demonstrate a major contribution of NETs to the pathology of sepsis-associated ALI by inducing ferroptosis of alveolar epithelial cells. Using both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; studies, our findings show enhanced NETs accumulation in sepsis-associated ALI patients and mice, as well as the closely related upregulation of ferroptosis, the induction of which depends on METTL3-induced m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification of GPX4. Using a CLP-induced sepsis-associated ALI mouse model established with &lt;em&gt;METTL3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; versus WT mice, in addition to METTL3 knockout and overexpression in vitro, we elucidated and confirmed the critical role of ferroptosis in NETs-induced ALI. These findings support a role for NETs-induced METTL3 modification and the subsequent induction of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of sepsis-associated ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Canonical and noncanonical regulatory roles for JAK2 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35522243/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) are two fibrotic interstitial lung diseases that share the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) injury pattern. Here, we report that RNA sequencing of lung biopsies from patients with RA-ILD and IPF revealed shared and distinct disease-causing pathways. Analysis of transcriptomic data identified a JAK2 related JAK/STAT signaling pathway gene signature that distinguishes RA-UIP from idiopathic UIP. This was further confirmed by immunohistostaining, which identified JAK2 phosphorylation with two distinct forms of activation: a cytoplasmic form of JAK2 activation in most IPF cases (13/20) and a nuclear form of p-JAK2 in RA-UIP (5/5) and a minority of IPF (6/20) cases. Further immunohistostaining identified STAT5A&amp;amp;B as the downstream transcriptional activator for JAK2-mediated canonical signal transduction and phosphorylation of Tyr41 on histone H3 (H3Y41ph) as the downstream epigenetic regulation site for JAK2-mediated noncanonical signal transduction. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the RNA-Seq data further supported this shared pathogenic mechanism for the two diseases with the enrichment of STAT5A&amp;amp;B target gene sets as well as the JAK2 regulated H3Y41ph target gene set. This regulatory role of JAK2 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis was further demonstrated by the attenuation of bleomycin-induced murine pulmonary fibrosis using a JAK2-selective pharmacological inhibitor CEP33779. In vitro studies with normal and IPF derived lung fibroblasts revealed a central role for JAK2 as an essential intermediary molecule in TGF-β-mediated myofibroblast trans-differentiation, proliferation, and extracellular matrix protein production. These observations support a crucial role for JAK2 as an intermediary molecule in fibrotic lung disease development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by severe proteinuria as a consequence of kidney glomerular injury due to podocyte damage. In vitro models mimicking in vivo podocyte characteristics are a prerequisite to resolve NS pathogenesis. The detailed characterization of organoid podocytes resulting from a hybrid culture protocol showed a podocyte population that resembles adult podocytes and was superior compared with 2D counterparts, based on single-cell RNA sequencing, super-resolution imaging and electron microscopy. In this study, these next-generation podocytes in kidney organoids enabled personalized idiopathic nephrotic syndrome modeling, as shown by activated slit diaphragm signaling and podocyte injury following protamine sulfate, puromycin aminonucleoside treatment and exposure to NS plasma containing pathogenic permeability factors. Organoids cultured from cells of a patient with heterozygous NPHS2 mutations showed poor NPHS2 expression and aberrant NPHS1 localization, which was reversible after genetic correction. Repaired organoids displayed increased VEGFA pathway activity and transcription factor activity known to be essential for podocyte physiology, as shown by RNA sequencing. This study shows that organoids are the preferred model of choice to study idiopathic and congenital podocytopathies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Small Extracellular Vesicles Containing miR-34c Derived from Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Regulates Epithelial Sodium Channel via Targeting MARCKS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35563590/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a pivotal regulator of alveolar fluid clearance in the airway epithelium and plays a key role in the treatment of acute lung injury (ALI), which is mainly composed of the three homologous subunits (α, β and γ). The mechanisms of microRNAs in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cell (MSC-sEVs) on the regulation of lung ion transport are seldom reported. In this study, we aimed at investigating whether miR-34c had an effect on ENaC dysfunction induced by lipopolysaccharide and explored the underlying mechanism in this process. Primarily, the effect of miR-34c on lung edema and histopathology changes in an ALI mouse model was investigated. Then the uptake of PKH26-labeled sEVs was observed in recipient cells, and we observed that the overexpression of miR-34c in MSC-sEVs could upregulate the LPS-inhibited γ-ENaC expression. The dual luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) was one of target genes of miR-34c, the protein expression of which was negatively correlated with miR-34c. Subsequently, either upregulating miR-34c or knocking down MARCKS could increase the protein expression of phospho-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K) and phospho-protein kinase B (p-AKT), implying a downstream regulation pathway was involved. All of the above suggest that miR-34c in MSC-sEVs can attenuate edematous lung injury via enhancing γ-ENaC expression, at least partially, through targeting MARCKS and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway subsequently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor Lysis Syndrome and AKI: Beyond Crystal Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35523579/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The pathophysiology of AKI during tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is not well understood due to the paucity of data. We aimed to decipher crystal-dependent and crystal-independent mechanisms of TLS-induced AKI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Crystalluria, plasma cytokine levels, and extracellular histones levels were measured in two cohorts of patients with TLS. We developed a model of TLS in syngeneic mice with acute myeloid leukemia, and analyzed ultrastructural changes in kidneys and endothelial permeability using intravital confocal microscopy. In parallel, we studied the endothelial toxicity of extracellular histones in vitro. RESULTS: The study provides the first evidence that previously described crystal-dependent mechanisms are insufficient to explain TLS-induced AKI. Extracellular histones that are released in huge amounts during TLS caused profound endothelial alterations in the mouse model. The mechanisms of histone-mediated damage implicates endothelial cell activation mediated by Toll-like receptor 4. Heparin inhibits extracellular histones and mitigates endothelial dysfunction during TLS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study sheds new light on the pathophysiology of TLS-induced AKI and suggests that extracellular histones may constitute a novel target for therapeutic intervention in TLS when endothelial dysfunction occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of lung endothelial cells identifies dynamic inflammatory and regenerative subpopulations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35511435/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have demonstrated the phenotypic heterogeneity of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) within a vascular bed; however, little is known about how distinct endothelial subpopulations in a particular organ respond to an inflammatory stimulus. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq of 35,973 lung ECs obtained during baseline as well as postinjury time points after inflammatory lung injury induced by LPS. Seurat clustering and gene expression pathway analysis identified 2 major subpopulations in the lung microvascular endothelium, a subpopulation enriched for expression of immune response genes such as MHC genes (immuneEC) and another defined by increased expression of vascular development genes such as Sox17 (devEC). The presence of immuneEC and devEC subpopulations was also observed in nonhuman primate lungs infected with SARS-CoV-2 and murine lungs infected with H1N1 influenza virus. After the peak of inflammatory injury, we observed the emergence of a proliferative lung EC subpopulation. Overexpression of Sox17 prevented inflammatory activation in ECs. Thus, there appeared to be a &amp;ldquo;division of labor&amp;rdquo; within the lung microvascular endothelium in which some ECs showed propensity for inflammatory signaling and others for endothelial regeneration. These results provide underpinnings for the development of targeted therapies to limit inflammatory lung injury and promote regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Arsenic induces ferroptosis and acute lung injury through mtROS-mediated mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane dysfunction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acute As exposure induced pulmonary function decline and ALI in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acute As exposure caused ferroptosis, MAMs dysfunction and mitochondrial stress in mice lungs and pulmonary epithelial cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretreatment with ferrostatin-1 alleviated As-induced pulmonary function decline and ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PERK inhibitor and Mfn-2-overexpression inhibited As-evoked ferroptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MitoQ neutralized As-mediated MAMs dysfunction, mtROS production and ferroptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MitoQ abolished As-induced decline of the interaction between PERK and Mfn-2 in pulmonary epithelial cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MitoQ attenuated As-caused ferroptosis and ALI in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study was to analyze whether mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAMs) dysfunction mediated arsenic (As)-evoked pulmonary ferroptosis and acute lung injury (ALI). As exposure led to alveolar structure damage, inflammatory cell infiltration and pulmonary function decline in mice. Ferritin, the marker of iron overload, was increased, GPX4, the index of lipid peroxidation, was decreased in As-exposed lungs and pulmonary epithelial cells (MLE-12). Pretreatment with ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), the inhibitor of ferroptosis, alleviated As-evoked ALI. In addition, As-induced non-heme iron deposition was inhibited in Fer-1 pretreated-mice. Moreover, As-triggered mitochondria damage and ferroptosis were mitigated in Fer-1 pretreated-MLE-12 cells. Mechanistically, PERK phosphorylation and mitofusin-2 (Mfn-2) reduction was observed in As-exposed MLE-12 cells and mice lungs. Additionally, the interaction between PERK and Mfn-2 was downregulated and MAMs dysfunction was observed in As-exposed MLE-12 cells. Intriguingly, PERK inhibitor and Mfn-2-overexpression all mitigated As-induced ferroptosis in MLE-12 cells. Additionally, CLPP and mtHSP70, the markers of mitochondrial stress, were upregulated, mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) was elevated, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP were decreased in As-exposed MLE-12 cells. Mitoquinone mesylate (MitoQ), a novel mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, alleviated As-induced excess mtROS, mitochondrial stress, MAMs dysfunction in pulmonary epithelial cells. Similarly, in vivo experiments indicated that MitoQ pretreatment countered As-induced pulmonary ferroptosis and ALI. These data indicated that mtROS-initiated MAMs dysfunction is, at least partially, implicated in As-evoked ferroptosis and ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cortactin loss protects against hemin-induced acute lung injury in sickle cell disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35503995/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a common form of acute lung injury and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of ACS is complex, and hemin, the prosthetic moiety of hemoglobin, has been implicated in endothelial cell (EC) activation and subsequent acute lung injury (ALI) and ACS in vitro and in animal studies. Here, we examined the role of cortactin (CTTN), a cytoskeletal protein that regulates EC function, in response to hemin-induced ALI and ACS. Cortactin heterozygous (&lt;em&gt;Cttn&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice (n = 8) and their wild-type siblings (n = 8) were irradiated and subsequently received bone marrow cells (BMCs) extruded from the femurs of SCD mice (SS) to generate SS &lt;em&gt;Cttn&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and SS &lt;em&gt;Cttn&lt;sup&gt;WT&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; chimeras. Following hemoglobin electrophoretic proof of BMC transplantation, the mice received 35 µmol/kg of hemin. Within 24 h, surviving mice were euthanized, and bronchoalveolar fluid (BAL) and lung samples were analyzed. For in vitro studies, human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) were used to determine hemin-induced changes in gene expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cortactin deficiency and control conditions. When compared with wild-type littermates, the mortality for SS &lt;em&gt;Cttn&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice trended to be lower after hemin infusion and these mice exhibited less severe lung injury and less necroptotic cell death. In vitro studies confirmed that cortactin deficiency is protective against hemin-induced injury in HMLVECs, by decreasing protein expression of p38/HSP27, improving cell barrier function, and decreasing the production of ROS. Further studies examining the role of CTTN in ACS are warranted and may open a new avenue of potential treatment for this devastating disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) interacts with Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling in obstructed kidneys in vivo</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35525270/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follistatin (FS)-like 1 (FSTL1) is a member of the FS-SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) family of secreted and extracellular matrix proteins. The functions of FSTL1 have been studied in heart and lung injury as well as in wound healing; however, the role of FSTL1 in the kidney is largely unknown. Here, we show using single-cell RNA-Seq that Fstl1 was enriched in stromal cells in obstructed mouse kidneys. In addition, immunofluorescence demonstrated that FSTL1 expression was induced in fibroblasts during kidney fibrogenesis in mice and human patients. We demonstrate that FSTL1 overexpression increased renal fibrosis and activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, known to promote kidney fibrosis, but not the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), Notch, Hedgehog, or Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathways in obstructed mouse kidneys, whereas inhibition of FSTL1 lowered Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Importantly, we show that FSTL1 interacted with Wnt ligands and the Frizzled (FZD) receptors but not the coreceptor lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). Specifically, we found FSTL1 interacted with Wnt3a through its extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain and von Willebrand factor type C-like (VWC) domain, and with FZD4 through its EC domain. Furthermore, we show that FSTL1 increased the association of Wnt3a with FZD4 and promoted Wnt/β-catenin signaling and fibrogenesis. The EC domain interacting with both Wnt3a and FZD4 also enhanced Wnt3a signaling. Therefore, we conclude that FSTL1 is a novel extracellular enhancer of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Few studies reported the therapeutic effect of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) in lung inflammatory diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory role and underlying molecular in cadmium-induced lung injury have been poorly understood, directly linked to chronic lung diseases (CLDs): chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer etc. Therefore, in this study we aim to investigate the therapeutic activities of water extract of KRG (KRG-WE) in mouse cadmium-induced lung injury model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Method:&lt;/em&gt; The anti-inflammatory roles and underlying mechanisms of KRG-WE were evaluated in vitro under cadmium-stimulated lung epithelial cells (A549) and HEK293T cell line and in vivo in cadmium-induced lung injury mouse model using semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), luciferase assay, immunoblotting, and FACS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; KRG-WE strongly ameliorated the symptoms of CdSO4-induced lung injury in mice according to total cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and severity scores as well as cytokine levels. KRG-WE significantly suppressed the upregulation of inflammatory signaling comprising mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and their upstream enzymes. In in vitro study, KRG-WE suppressed expression of interleukin (IL)-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and IL-8 while promoting recovery in CdSO4-treated A549 cells. Similarly, KRG-WE reduced phosphorylation of MAPK and c-Jun/c-Fos in cadmium-exposed A549 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; KRG-WE was found to attenuate symptoms of cadmium-induced lung injury and reduce the expression of inflammatory genes by suppression of MAPK/AP-1-mediated pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multi-omics analysis unravels dysregulated lysosomal function and lipid metabolism involved in sub-chronic particulate matter-induced pulmonary injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35525343/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A multi-omics approach was used to identify molecular changes in mouse lung tissues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM exposure impairs lung structure and inflammatory reactions in the mouse lungs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sub-chronic exposure to PM causes lung injury by disturbing lysosomal function and lipid metabolism homeostasis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different pathways are triggered in mouse lung tissues in response to PM exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulate matter (PM) is a huge environmental threat and is of major public concern. Oxidative stress and systemic inflammation are known factors that contribute to PM- related damage; however, a systematic understanding of the deleterious pulmonary effects of PM using multi-omics analysis is lacking. In this study, we performed transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses in a mouse model exposed to PM for three months to identify molecular changes in lung tissues. We identified 1690 genes, 326 proteins, and 67 metabolites exhibiting significant differences between PM-challenged and control mice (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Differentially expressed genes and proteins regulated in PM-challenged mice were involved in lipid metabolism and in the immune and inflammatory response processes. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of transcript, protein, and metabolite datasets revealed that the genes, proteins, and metabolites in the PM-treated group were involved in lysosomal function and lipid metabolism. Specifically, Cathepsin D (Ctsd), Ferritin light chain (Ftl), Lactotransferrin (Ltf), Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), and Prosaposin (Psap) were major proteins/genes associated with PM-induced pulmonary damage, while two lipid molecules PC (18:1(11Z)/16:0) and PA (16:0/18:1(11Z)) were major metabolites related to PM-induced pulmonary injury. In summary, lipid metabolism might be used as successful precautions and therapeutic targets in PM-induced pulmonary injury to maintain the stability of cellular lysosomal function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hydnocarpin D attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via MAPK/NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a complex pulmonary destructive disease with limited therapeutic approaches. Hydnocarpin D (HD) is a flavonolignan isolated from Hydnocarpus wightiana which possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether HD has beneficial effects on ALI as well as its underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study evaluated the protective effect of HD in ALI and the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, the role of HD on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice was tested by determination of neutrophil infiltration, levels of inflammatory cytokines, lung histology and edema, vascular and alveolar barrier disruption. In vitro, murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms RESULTS: Administration of HD protected mice against LPS-induced ALI, including ameliorating the histological alterations in the lung tissues, and decreasing lung edema, protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, infiltration of inflammatory cell and secretion of cytokines. Moreover, HD blocked the phosphorylation of TLR-4, NF-κB, and ERK in LPS-induced lung injury. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, HD inhibited LPS-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells, which largely depend upon the upregulation of antioxidant defensive Nrf2 pathway, thereby suppressing LPS-activated proinflammatory mediator secretion, NLRP3 inflammasome, and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; HD attenuates oxidative stress and inflammation against LPS-induced ALI via MAPK/NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, and is a promising novel therapeutic candidate for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3D In Vitro Models: Novel Insights into Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Pathophysiology and Drug Screening</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35563831/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and often lethal interstitial lung disease of unknown aetiology. IPF is characterised by myofibroblast activation, tissue stiffening, and alveolar epithelium injury. As current IPF treatments fail to halt disease progression or induce regeneration, there is a pressing need for the development of novel therapeutic targets. In this regard, tri-dimensional (3D) models have rapidly emerged as powerful platforms for disease modelling, drug screening and discovery. In this review, we will touch on how 3D in vitro models such as hydrogels, precision-cut lung slices, and, more recently, lung organoids and lung-on-chip devices have been generated and/or modified to reveal distinct cellular and molecular signalling pathways activated during fibrotic processes. Markedly, we will address how these platforms could provide a better understanding of fibrosis pathophysiology and uncover effective treatment strategies for IPF patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Toxicological effects of traffic-related air pollution on the lungs: Evidence, biomarkers and intervention</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35512471/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35512471/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epidemiological studies observed that traffic-related air pollution increases the risk of respiratory diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We examined the toxicological effects of the gasoline exhaust particles (GEP) on rat lungs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We found the evidence in the airway hyperresponsiveness, the inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and histological changes in the lung tissues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We found the biomarkers of the oxidative stress, the pro-inflammatory cytokines and the apoptosis cytokine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin E was found to be effective in reducing the toxicological effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Numerous epidemiological studies have recently observed that exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is associated with increased risk of various respiratory diseases. Major gaps in knowledge remain regarding the toxicological effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; We examined the toxicological effects of the gasoline exhaust particles (GEP), a paradigm of TRAP, in rats, with an objective to provide the evidence, obtain the biomarkers, and suggest effective intervention measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We measured the airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, histological changes in the lung tissues, and the biomarkers so as to systematically examine the toxicological effects of GEPs at different dose levels (0.5, 2.5, 5 mg/kg BW). The intervention of vitamin E (VE), a natural antioxidant, on the toxicological effects was investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The lung injury caused by GEP exposure was first indicated by the airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Compared with the control group, GEP exposure significantly increased the airway resistances and decreased the lung compliance; the higher the dose of GEP, the more serious the lung injury. Lung injury was also revealed by the increase of inflammatory cells, including the lymphocytes and neutrophils, in the BAL fluid. With the increase of GEP dose, histological changes in the lung tissues were further observed: inflammatory cell infiltration increased and alveolar wall thickened. The toxicology of GEP was demonstrated by the increase of the biomarkers of the oxidative stress, the pro-inflammatory cytokines and the apoptosis cytokine. However, administration of VE was found to be effective in restoring airway injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The toxicological effects of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) on rat lungs are supported by evidence and biomarkers, and vitamin E intervention is feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phrenic Nerve Block and Respiratory Effort in Pigs and Critically Ill Patients with Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35348581/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35348581/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Strong spontaneous inspiratory efforts can be difficult to control and prohibit protective mechanical ventilation. Instead of using deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade, the authors hypothesized that perineural administration of lidocaine around the phrenic nerve would reduce tidal volume (VT) and peak transpulmonary pressure in spontaneously breathing patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; An established animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome with six female pigs was used in a proof-of-concept study. The authors then evaluated this technique in nine mechanically ventilated patients under pressure support exhibiting driving pressure greater than 15 cm H2O or VT greater than 10 ml/kg of predicted body weight. Esophageal and transpulmonary pressures, electrical activity of the diaphragm, and electrical impedance tomography were measured in pigs and patients. Ultrasound imaging and a nerve stimulator were used to identify the phrenic nerve, and perineural lidocaine was administered sequentially around the left and right phrenic nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Results are presented as median [interquartile range, 25th to 75th percentiles]. In pigs, VT decreased from 7.4 ml/kg [7.2 to 8.4] to 5.9 ml/kg [5.5 to 6.6] (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as did peak transpulmonary pressure (25.8 cm H2O [20.2 to 27.2] to 17.7 cm H2O [13.8 to 18.8]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and driving pressure (28.7 cm H2O [20.4 to 30.8] to 19.4 cm H2O [15.2 to 22.9]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Ventilation in the most dependent part decreased from 29.3% [26.4 to 29.5] to 20.1% [15.3 to 20.8] (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In patients, VT decreased (8.2 ml/ kg [7.9 to 11.1] to 6.0 ml/ kg [5.7 to 6.7]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as did driving pressure (24.7 cm H2O [20.4 to 34.5] to 18.4 cm H2O [16.8 to 20.7]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Esophageal pressure, peak transpulmonary pressure, and electrical activity of the diaphragm also decreased. Dependent ventilation only slightly decreased from 11.5% [8.5 to 12.6] to 7.9% [5.3 to 8.6] (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005). Respiratory rate did not vary. Variables recovered 1 to 12.7 h [6.7 to 13.7] after phrenic nerve block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Phrenic nerve block is feasible, lasts around 12 h, and reduces VT and driving pressure without changing respiratory rate in patients under assisted ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prone Position Minimizes the Exacerbation of Effort-dependent Lung Injury: Exploring the Mechanism in Pigs and Evaluating Injury in Rabbits</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35303058/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Vigorous spontaneous effort can potentially worsen lung injury. This study hypothesized that the prone position would diminish a maldistribution of lung stress and inflation after diaphragmatic contraction and reduce spontaneous effort, resulting in less lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A severe acute respiratory distress syndrome model was established by depleting surfactant and injurious mechanical ventilation in 6 male pigs (&amp;ldquo;mechanism&amp;rdquo; protocol) and 12 male rabbits (&amp;ldquo;lung injury&amp;rdquo; protocol). In the mechanism protocol, regional inspiratory negative pleural pressure swing (intrabronchial balloon manometry) and the corresponding lung inflation (electrical impedance tomography) were measured with a combination of position (supine or prone) and positive end-expiratory pressure (high or low) matching the intensity of spontaneous effort. In the lung injury protocol, the intensities of spontaneous effort (esophageal manometry) and regional lung injury were compared in the supine position versus prone position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The mechanism protocol (pigs) found that in the prone position, there was no ventral-to-dorsal gradient in negative pleural pressure swing after diaphragmatic contraction, irrespective of the positive end-expiratory pressure level (-10.3 ± 3.3 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O vs. -11.7 ± 2.4 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at low positive end-expiratory pressure, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.115; -10.4 ± 3.4 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O vs. -10.8 ± 2.3 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at high positive end-expiratory pressure, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.715), achieving homogeneous inflation. In the supine position, however, spontaneous effort during low positive end-expiratory pressure had the largest ventral-to-dorsal gradient in negative pleural pressure swing (-9.8 ± 2.9 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O vs. -18.1 ± 4.0 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), causing dorsal overdistension. Higher positive end-expiratory pressure in the supine position reduced a ventral-to-dorsal gradient in negative pleural pressure swing, but it remained (-9.9 ± 2.8 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O vs. -13.3 ± 2.3 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The lung injury protocol (rabbits) found that in the prone position, spontaneous effort was milder and lung injury was less without regional difference (lung myeloperoxidase activity in ventral vs. dorsal lung, 74.0 ± 30.9 μm·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;· mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; protein vs. 61.0 ± 23.0 μm·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;·mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; protein, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.951). In the supine position, stronger spontaneous effort increased dorsal lung injury (lung myeloperoxidase activity in ventral vs. dorsal lung, 67.5 ± 38.1 μm·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;·mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; protein vs. 167.7 ± 65.5 μm·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;·mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; protein, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Prone position, independent of positive end-expiratory pressure levels, diminishes a maldistribution of lung stress and inflation imposed by spontaneous effort and mitigates spontaneous effort, resulting in less effort-dependent lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What We Already Know about This Topic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prone positioning during mechanical ventilation for patients with acute lung injury has been shown to increase oxygenation and possibly improve outcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is now widely used for patients with COVID-19 failing routine ventilation protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its use during spontaneous ventilation has increased as result of the pandemic, yet detailed data on its ventilatory effects have not been well established&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What This Article Tells Us That Is New&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The authors utilized porcine and rabbit models of lung injury to evaluate pulmonary mechanics, distribution of ventilation, and biochemical and histologic effects on lung injury with varying positive end-expiratory pressure levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent of positive end-expiratory pressure levels, prone positioning reduced maldistribution of lung stress and reduced effort-dependent evidence of lung injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Pirfenidone ameliorates early pulmonary fibrosis in LPS-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome by inhibiting endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition via the Hedgehog signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35504205/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pirfenidone(PFD) treatment can inhibit the progress of pulmonary fibrosis and notably reduce the mortality of ARDS mice in early stage of ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PFD reduces early pulmonary fibrosis stimulated by LPS, which is related to the inhibition of EndMT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PFD may ameliorate LPS-induced ARDS by regulating the HH signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary vascular endothelial dysfunction is a key pathogenic mechanism in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in fibrosis in lung tissues, including in the context of COVID-19. Pirfenidone (PFD) has become a novel therapeutic agent for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and can improve lung function, inhibit fibrosis and inhibit inflammation. Recently, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) was shown to play a crucial role in various respiratory diseases. However, the role of PFD in the course of EndMT in LPS-induced ARDS remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the anti-EndMT effects of PFD on pulmonary fibrosis after LPS-induced ARDS. First, we determined that PFD significantly reduced LPS-induced ARDS, as shown by significant pathological alterations, and alleviated the oxidative stress and inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, PFD decreased pulmonary fibrosis in LPS-induced ARDS by inhibiting EndMT and reduced the expression levels of Hedgehog (HH) pathway target genes, such as Gli1 and α-SMA, after LPS induction. In summary, this study confirmed that inhibiting the HH pathway by PFD could decrease pulmonary fibrosis by downregulating EndMT in LPS-induced ARDS. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PFD is a promising agent to attenuate pulmonary fibrosis following ARDS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UDP/P2Y6 contributes to enhancing LPS-induced acute lung injury by regulating neutrophil migration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35567855/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils play a prominent role in the inflammatory response and are a critical factor in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). Despite a deep understanding of neutrophil accumulation in the pulmonary microvasculature during the process of this disease, the regulatory mechanism of neutrophil recruitment remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the functions and signaling pathways of the purinergic receptor P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in mediating the innate immune response in ALI. P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-deficient mice, bone marrow chimeras, and neutrophilic chimeras were created in this work to explore the function of P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in ALI. The results indicated that the extracellular nucleotide UDP was released as a dangerous signal and activated P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to promote the inflammatory response and pulmonary damage during the process of ALI. P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency may mitigate deterioration of this disease, including reduced ALI-related inflammatory factor release and immune cell invasion. Bone marrow and neutrophil chimeras and adoptive transfer in mice showed that P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; expression on neutrophils contributed to neutrophil infiltration into lung tissues induced by UDP. Further work indicated that P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; was involved in the neutrophil migration capability through the ErK signaling pathway by mediating the deformation of F-actin filaments and pseudopodia formation during cell recruitment to pulmonary tissue. Here, we provide evidence for the mechanism by which the purinergic receptor P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; contributes to ALI development by regulating neutrophil infiltration into lung tissues. These data indicated that P2Y&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this acute severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>L-OPA1 deficiency aggravates necroptosis of alveolar epithelial cells through impairing mitochondrial function during acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35478455/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necroptosis, a recently described form of programmed cell death, is the main way of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) death in acute lung injury (ALI). While the mechanism of how to trigger necroptosis in AECs during ALI has been rarely evaluated. Long optic atrophy protein 1 (L-OPA1) is a crucial mitochondrial inner membrane fusion protein, and its deficiency impairs mitochondrial function. This study aimed to investigate the role of L-OPA1 deficiency-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction in AECs necroptosis. We comprehensively investigated the detailed contribution and molecular mechanism of L-OPA1 deficiency in AECs necroptosis by inhibiting or activating L-OPA1. First, our data showed that L-OPA1 expression was downregulated in the lungs and AECs under the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Furthermore, inhibition of L-OPA1 aggravated the pathological injury, inflammatory response, and necroptosis in the lungs of LPS-induced ALI mice. In vitro, inhibition of L-OPA1 induced necroptosis of AECs, while activation of L-OPA1 alleviated necroptosis of AECs under the LPS challenge. Mechanistically, inhibition of L-OPA1 aggravated necroptosis of AECs by inducing mitochondrial fragmentation and reducing mitochondrial membrane potential. While activation of L-OPA1 had the opposite effects. In summary, these findings indicate for the first time that L-OPA1 deficiency mediates mitochondrial fragmentation, induces necroptosis of AECs, and exacerbates ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vimentin intermediate filaments, a type III intermediate filament, are among the most widely studied IFs and are found abundantly in mesenchymal cells. Vimentin intermediate filaments localize primarily in the cytoplasm but can also be found on the cell surface and extracellular space. The cytoplasmic vimentin is well-recognized for its role in providing mechanical strength and regulating cell migration, adhesion, and division. The post-translationally modified forms of Vimentin intermediate filaments have several implications in host-pathogen interactions, cancers, and non-malignant lung diseases. This review will analyze the role of vimentin beyond just the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker highlighting its role as a regulator of host-pathogen interactions and signaling pathways for the pathophysiology of various lung diseases. In addition, we will also examine the clinically relevant anti-vimentin compounds and antibodies that could potentially interfere with the pathogenic role of Vimentin intermediate filaments in lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Current kidney function parameters overestimate kidney tissue repair in reversible experimental kidney disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35483527/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although underlying mechanisms and the clinical course of kidney disease progression are well described, less is known about potential disease reversibility. Therefore, to analyze kidney recovery, we adapted a commonly used murine chronic kidney disease (CKD) model of 2,8- dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA) crystal-induced nephropathy to study disease recovery and efficacy of disease-modifying interventions. The recovery phase after CKD was characterized by improved kidney function after two weeks which remained stable thereafter. By contrast, even after eight weeks recovery, tubular injury and inflammation were only partially reduced, and fibrosis persisted. Deep-learning-based histologic analysis of 8,604 glomeruli and 596,614 tubular cross sections revealed numerous tubules had undergone either prominent dilation or complete atrophy, leading to atubular glomeruli and irreversible nephron loss. We confirmed these findings in a second CKD model, reversible unilateral ureteral obstruction, in which a rapid improvement of glomerular filtration rate during recovery also did not reflect the permanent histologic kidney injury. In 2,8-DHA nephropathy, increased drinking volume was highly effective in disease prevention. However, in therapeutic approaches, high fluid intake was only effective in moderate but not severe CKD and established tissue injury was again poorly reflective of kidney function parameters. The injury was particularly localized in the medulla, which is often not analyzed. Thus, recovery after crystal- or obstruction-induced CKD is characterized by ongoing tissue injury, fibrosis, and nephron loss, but not reflected by standard measures of kidney function. Hence, our data might aid in designing kidney recovery studies and suggest the need for biomarkers specifically monitoring intra-kidney tissue injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Endothelial-specific loss of Krüppel-Like Factor 4 triggers complement-mediated endothelial injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35483525/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in the kidney represents the most severe manifestation of kidney microvascular endothelial injury. Despite the source of the inciting event, the diverse clinical forms of kidney TMA share dysregulation of endothelial cell transcripts and complement activation. Here, we show that endothelial-specific knockdown of Krüppel-Like Factor 4 (Klf4)ΔEC, an anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic zinc-finger transcription factor, increases the susceptibility to glomerular endothelial injury and microangiopathy in two genetic murine models that included endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout mice and aged mice (52 weeks), as well as in a pharmacologic model of TMA using Shiga-toxin 2. In all models, Klf4ΔEC mice exhibit increased pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory transcripts, as well as increased complement factors C3 and C5b-9 deposition and histologic features consistent with subacute TMA. Interestingly, complement activation in Klf4ΔEC mice was accompanied by reduced expression of a key KLF4 transcriptional target and membrane bound complement regulatory gene, Cd55. To assess a potential mechanism by which KLF4 might regulate CD55 expression, we performed in silico chromatin immunoprecipitation enrichment analysis of the CD55 promotor and found KLF4 binding sites upstream from the CD55 transcription start site. Using patient-derived kidney biopsy specimens, we found glomerular expression of KLF4 and CD55 was reduced in patients with TMA as compared to control biopsies of the unaffected pole of patient kidneys removed due to kidney cancer. Thus, our data support that endothelial Klf4 is necessary for maintenance of a quiescent glomerular endothelial phenotype and its loss increases susceptibility to complement activation and induction of prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Endotypes of Prematurity and Phenotypes of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia: Toward Personalized Neonatology</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35629108/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of prematurity, is increasingly recognized as the consequence of a pathological reparative response of the developing lung to both antenatal and postnatal injury. According to this view, the pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial and heterogeneous with different patterns of antenatal stress (endotypes) that combine with varying postnatal insults and might distinctively damage the development of airways, lung parenchyma, interstitium, lymphatic system, and pulmonary vasculature. This results in different clinical phenotypes of BPD. There is no clear consensus on which are the endotypes of prematurity but the combination of clinical information with placental and bacteriological data enables the identification of two main pathways leading to birth before 32 weeks of gestation: (1) infection/inflammation and (2) dysfunctional placentation. Regarding BPD phenotypes, the following have been proposed: parenchymal, peripheral airway, central airway, interstitial, congestive, vascular, and mixed phenotype. In line with the approach of personalized medicine, endotyping prematurity and phenotyping BPD will facilitate the design of more targeted therapeutic and prognostic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhaled tire-wear microplastic particles induced pulmonary fibrotic injury via epithelial cytoskeleton rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35486965/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tire wear microplastic particles (TWMPs) are emerging microplastic pollutants that have gained increasing attention lately. However, the health effect of inhaled airborne TWMPs has never been explored before and may already be included in particulate matter morbidity and mortality. Here, we endeavored to address the preliminary study of TWMP inhalation-induced pulmonary toxic effects and its epigenetic mechanisms in C57BL/6 mice. As a result, restricted ventilatory dysfunction and fibrotic pathological changes were observed in TWMP-treaded mice. Further research found that attenuation of miR-1a-3p plays an important role in TWMP-induced lung injury. Results from in vitro study confirmed that cytoskeleton regulatory gene twinfilin-1 was one of the target genes of miR-1a-3p, and involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement caused by TWMP exposure. Mechanistically, miR-1a-3p inhibited the F-actin formation by targeting cytoskeletal regulatory proteins twinfilin-1, leading to TWMP-induced pulmonary fibrotic injury. While we are in the very early stages of explaining the role of epigenetics in TWMP-induced lung injury, the potential for the use of epigenetic marks as biomarkers is high and discoveries made in this field will likely bring us closer to better understanding this crucial mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protein phosphatase 2Acα modulates fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis to determine tubular cell fate and kidney injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy metabolism is crucial in maintaining cellular homeostasis and adapting to stimuli for tubular cells. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we report that PP2Acα was upregulated in damaged tubular cells from patients and animal models with acute or chronic kidney injury. Using in vitro and in vivo model, we demonstrated that PP2Acα induction in damaged tubular cells suppresses fatty acid oxidation and promotes glycolysis, leading to cell death and fibrosis. Mechanistically, we revealed that PP2Acα dephosphorylates ACC through interaction with B56δ, leading to the regulation of fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, PP2Acα also dephosphorylates p-Glut1 (Thr478) and suppresses Trim21-mediated Glut1 ubiquitination and degradation, leading to the promotion of glucose intake and glycolysis. Thus, this study adds new insight into the tubular cell metabolic alterations in kidney diseases. PP2Acα may be a promising therapeutic target for kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TLR2/caspase-5/Panx1 pathway mediates necrosis-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages during acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35473933/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by necroinflammation formed by necrotic tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and interstitial inflammation. In necroinflammation, macrophages are key inflammatory cells and can be activated and polarized into proinflammatory macrophages. Membranous Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can cooperate with intracellular NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) to recognize danger signals from necrotic TECs and activate proinflammatory macrophages by assembling NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the cooperation between TLRs and NLRP3 is still unclear. Using conditioned medium from necrotic TECs, we confirmed that necrotic TECs could release danger signals to activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. We further identified that necrotic TECs-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation was dependent on ATP secretion via Pannexin-1 (Panx1) channel in macrophages. Next, we verified that TLR2 was required for the activation of Panx1 and NLRP3 in macrophages. Mechanistically, we indicated that caspase-5 mediated TLR2-induced Panx1 activation. In addition, we showed that necrotic TECs-induced activation of TLR2/caspase-5/Panx1 axis could be decreased in macrophages when TECs was protected by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Overall, we demonstrate that danger signals from necrotic TECs could activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages via TLR2/caspase-5/Panx1 axis during AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cyclin-dependent kinase 4-related tubular epithelial cell proliferation is regulated by Paired box gene 2 in kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paired box 2 (Pax2) is a transcription factor essential for kidney development and is reactivated in proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) during recovery from kidney injury. However, the role of Pax2 in this process is still unknown. Here the role of Pax2 reactivation during injury was examined in the proliferation of PTECs using an ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) mouse model. Kidney proximal tubule-specific Pax2 conditional knockout mice were generated by mating kidney androgen-regulated protein-Cre and Pax2 flox mice. The degree of cell proliferation and fibrosis was assessed and a Pax2 inhibitor (EG1) was used to evaluate the role of Pax2 in the hypoxic condition of cultured PTECs (O2 5%, 24 hours). The number of Pax2-positive cells and Pax2 mRNA increased after IRI. Sirius red staining indicated that the area of interstitial fibrosis was significantly larger in knockout mice 14 days after IRI. The number of Ki-67-positive cells (an index of proliferation) was significantly lower in knockout than in wild-type mice after IRI, whereas the number of TUNEL-positive cells (an index of apoptotic cells) was significantly higher in knockout mice four days after IRI. Expression analyses of cell cycle-related genes showed that cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) was significantly less expressed in the Pax2 knockout mice. In vitro data showed that the increase in CDK4 mRNA and protein expression induced by hypoxia was attenuated by EG1. Thus, Pax2 reactivation may be involved in PTEC proliferation by activating CDK4, thereby limiting kidney fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liproxstatin-1 alleviates LPS/IL-13-induced bronchial epithelial cell injury and neutrophilic asthma in mice by inhibiting ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35483233/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corrigendum to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576922009675&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liproxstatin-1 alleviates LPS/IL-13-induced bronchial epithelial cell injury and neutrophilic asthma in mice by inhibiting ferroptosis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; [Int. Immunopharmacol. 109 (2022) 108770].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferroptosis occurred in the lung of mice suffering OVA/LPS-induced neutrophilic asthma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liproxstatin-1 alleviated neutrophilic asthma in mice by inhibiting ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liproxstatin-1 could prevent LPS/IL-13-induced ferroptosis and inflammatory factor release in HBE and BEAS-2B cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liproxstatin-1 inhibited ferroptosis in asthmatic mice lung tissues and bronchial epithelial cells via the GPX4/SLC7A11 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Ferroptosis is closely associated with respiratory diseases; however, the relationship between ferroptosis and neutrophilic asthma remains unknown. This study investigated whether Liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1) affects the progression of neutrophilic asthma by inhibiting ferroptosis and inflammatory response, while dissecting the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE and BEAS-2B) were administered with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) to generate a cell injury model. This cell model was employed to examine the effect of Lip-1 on airway epithelial-associated inflammation and ferroptosis as well as the underlying molecular mechanism. Meanwhile, we evaluated the effects of Lip-1 on neutrophilic asthma and ferroptosis by using the ovalbumin (OVA)/LPS-induced mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Lip-1 reversed the altered expression of ferroptotic regulators (glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2)), attenuated lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS) and ameliorated cell viability in HBE and BEAS-2B cells administered with LPS and IL-13. Moreover, Lip-1 treatment led to a marked reduction in the expression of IL-33, TSLP, IL-8, IL-6, and HMGB1 in the HBE and BEAS-2B cells. In the meantime, administration with Lip-1 markedly relieved OVA/LPS-induced neutrophilic asthma, as indicated by significant improvement in lung pathological changes, airway mucus secretion, inflammation, and ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study provides data suggesting that Lip-1 alleviates neutrophilic asthma in vivo and in vitro through inhibiting ferroptosis, perhaps providing a new strategy for neutrophilic asthma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and platinum-based chemotherapy (CT) are effective therapeutic agents for the palliative treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); the aim of our study was to investigate the acute and chronic renal toxicities in this setting. We collected data on 292 patients who received cisplatin (35%), carboplatin-based regimens (25%), or ICI monotherapy (40%). The primary and secondary outcomes were compared to the acute kidney injury (AKI) rate and the mean estimated GFR (eGFR) decay between groups, respectively, over a mean follow-up duration of 15 weeks. We observed 26 AKI events (8.9%), mostly stage I AKI (80.7%); 15% were stage II AKI, 3.8% were stage III, and none required renal replacement therapy or ICU admission. The AKI rates were 10.9%, 6.8%, and 8.9% for the cisplatin, carboplatin, and ICI groups, respectively, and no significant differences were observed between the groups (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.3). A global mean eGFR decay of 2.2 mL/min was observed, while for the cisplatin, carboplatin, and ICI groups, the eGFR decay values were 2.3 mL/min, 1.1 mL/min, and 3.5 mL/min, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the groups. Cisplatin/carboplatin-based CT and ICIs resulted in a similar incidence of AKI and eGFR decay, suggesting the safety of their cautious use, even in CKD patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin alleviates LPS-induced lung injury and edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin prolongs the survival rates of mice suffered from lethal doses of LPS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin attenuates NLRP3/GADMD pathway-driven pyroptosis via inhibiting oxidative stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin inhibits LPS-induced ALI through regulating the feasible interactions between Nrf2 signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/ acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is featured by intensive inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, which lead to cytokine storms and pyroptosis. Here, we aimed to investigate whether melatonin was capable of alleviating LPS-induced ALI via activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 (Nrf2/HO-1) signaling axis and inhibiting pyroptosis. Mice were injected with melatonin (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for consecutive five days before LPS instillation intratracheally, and human alveolar epithelial cell (AECⅡ) A549 cell lines and murine macrophages Raw264.7 cell lines were pretreated with melatonin (400 μM) before LPS (10 μg/ml) stimulation. The result demonstrated that LPS induced obvious lung injury characterized by alveolar damage, neutrophil infiltration and lung edema as well as the reduction of the survival rate of mice, which were totally reversed by melatonin pretreatment. Mechanistically, melatonin pretreatment activated nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor (Nrf) 2 signaling, subsequently, drove antioxidant pathways including significant increases in the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, Mn-SOD and Catalase in vivo and in vitro. Simultaneously, melatonin inhibited ROS and MDA overproduction, iNOS expression as well as TNF-α and IL-1β expression and release. Furthermore, melatonin inhibited LPS-induced pyroptosis by reversing the overexpression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18 and GSDMD-N, as well as LDH release and TUNEL-positive cells in A549 cells and Raw264.7 cells. Overall, the current study suggests that melatonin exerts protective roles on LPS-induced ALI and pyroptosis by inhibiting NLRP3-GSDMD pathway via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NRIP1 aggravates lung injury caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice by increasing PIAS1 ubiquitination</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35460552/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, evidence has shown that nuclear receptor interacting protein 1 (NRIP1) is involved in acute lung injury (ALI) progression, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)-treated TC-1 cells were transfected with pcDNA-NRIP1 or si-NRIP1, and we found that overexpression of NRIP1 inhibited cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis and secretion of inflammatory factors, and transfection of si-NRIP1 reversed these effects. Furthermore, online bioinformatics analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assay results indicated that NRIP1 could bind to Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzyme E2I (UBE2I), and promoted UBE2I expression. Next, the PA-treated TC-1 cells were transfected with si-NRIP1 alone or together with pcDNA-UBE2I, and we observed that transfection with si-NRIP1 inhibited UBE2I expression, promoted cell viability, and reduced cell apoptosis and inflammatory factor secretion, which could be reversed by UBE2I overexpression. Moreover, UBE2I could bind to protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activators of transcription 1 (PIAS1). Overexpression of NRIP1 promoted UBE2I expression and inhibited PIAS1 expression, and NRIP1 promoted PIAS1 ubiquitination and degradation by UBE2I. The PA-treated TC-1 cells were transfected with si-UBE2I alone or together with si-PIAS1, and the results indicated that transfection of si-UBE2I had the same effect as transfection of si-NRIP1. Finally, our in vivo findings indicated that the expression of NRIP1 and UBE2I was decreased, and PIAS1 expression was increased, in the lung tissues of mice with NRIP1 knocked-down, and the inflammatory infiltration in the lung tissue was reduced. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that NRIP1 aggravates PA-induced lung injury in mice by promoting PIAS1 ubiquitination.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 infection of human-induced pluripotent stem cells-derived lung lineage cells evokes inflammatory and chemosensory responses by targeting mitochondrial pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35460571/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the lung, particularly the proximal airway and distal alveolar cells. NKX2.1+ primordial lung progenitors of the foregut (anterior) endoderm are the developmental precursors to all adult lung epithelial lineages and are postulated to play an important role in viral tropism. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 readily infected and replicated in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived proximal airway cells, distal alveolar cells, and lung progenitors. In addition to the upregulation of antiviral defense and immune responses, transcriptomics data uncovered a robust epithelial cell-specific response, including perturbation of metabolic processes and disruption in the alveolar maturation program. We also identified spatiotemporal dysregulation of mitochondrial heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), which is associated with defense against antioxidant-induced lung injury. Cytokines, such as TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-6, and IL-13, were upregulated in infected cells sparking mitochondrial ROS production and change in electron transport chain complexes. Increased mitochondrial ROS then activated additional proinflammatory cytokines leading to an aberrant cell cycle resulting in apoptosis. Notably, we are the first to report a chemosensory response resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection similar to that seen in COVID-19 patients. Some of our key findings were validated using COVID-19-affected postmortem lung tissue sections. These results suggest that our in vitro system could serve as a suitable model to investigate the pathogenetic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to discover and test therapeutic drugs against COVID-19 or its consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Universal lung epithelium DNA methylation markers for detection of lung damage in liquid biopsies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35450968/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35450968/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Circulating biomarkers for lung damage are lacking. Lung epithelium-specific DNA methylation patterns can potentially report the presence of lung-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood, as an indication of lung cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We sorted human lung alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells from surgical specimens, and obtained their methylomes using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. We developed a PCR sequencing assay determining the methylation status of 17 loci with lung-specific methylation patterns, and used it to assess lung-derived cfDNA in the plasma of healthy volunteers and patients with lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Loci that are uniquely unmethylated in alveolar or bronchial epithelial cells are enriched for enhancers controlling lung-specific genes. Methylation markers extracted from these methylomes revealed that normal lung cell turnover probably releases cfDNA into the air spaces, rather than to blood. People with advanced lung cancer show a massive elevation of lung cfDNA concentration in blood. Among individuals undergoing bronchoscopy, lung-derived cfDNA is observed in the plasma of those later diagnosed with lung cancer, and to a lesser extent in those diagnosed with other lung diseases. Lung cfDNA is also elevated in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD compared with patients with stable disease, and is associated with future exacerbation and mortality in these patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Universal cfDNA methylation markers of normal lung epithelium allow for mutation-independent, sensitive and specific detection of lung-derived cfDNA, reporting on ongoing lung injury. Such markers can find broad utility in the study of normal and pathologic human lung dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rabeprazole Promotes Vascular Repair and Resolution of Sepsis-Induced Inflammatory Lung Injury through HIF-1α</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35563731/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no effective treatments for sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The repositioning of existing drugs is one possible effective strategy for the treatment of sepsis and ARDS. We previously showed that vascular repair and the resolution of sepsis-induced inflammatory lung injury is dependent upon endothelial HIF-1α/FoxM1 signaling. The aim of this study was to identify a candidate inducer of HIF-1α/FoxM1 signaling for the treatment of sepsis and ARDS. Employing high throughput screening of a library of 1200 FDA-approved drugs by using hypoxia response element (HRE)-driven luciferase reporter assays, we identified Rabeprazole (also known as Aciphex) as a top HIF-α activator. In cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells, Rabeprazole induced HIF1A mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. A dose-response study of Rabeprazole in a mouse model of endotoxemia-induced inflammatory lung injury identified a dose that was well tolerated and enhanced vascular repair and the resolution of inflammatory lung injury. Rabeprazole treatment resulted in reductions in lung vascular leakage, edema, and neutrophil sequestration and proinflammatory cytokine expression during the repair phrase. We next used &lt;em&gt;Hif1a/Tie2Cre&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice and &lt;em&gt;Foxm1/Tie2Cre&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice to show that Rabeprazole promoted vascular repair through HIF-1α/FoxM1 signaling. In conclusion, Rabeprazole is a potent inducer of HIF-1α that promotes vascular repair and the resolution of sepsis-induced inflammatory lung injury via endothelial HIF-1α/FoxM1 signaling. This drug therefore represents a promising candidate for repurposing to effectively treat severe sepsis and ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reduced Sarcolemmal Membrane Repair Exacerbates Striated Muscle Pathology in a Mouse Model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35563723/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a common X-linked degenerative muscle disorder that involves mutations in the DMD gene that frequently reduce the expression of the dystrophin protein, compromising the structural integrity of the sarcolemmal membrane and leaving it vulnerable to injury during cycles of muscle contraction and relaxation. This results in an increased frequency of sarcolemma disruptions that can compromise the barrier function of the membrane and lead to death of the myocyte. Sarcolemmal membrane repair processes can potentially compensate for increased membrane disruptions in DMD myocytes. Previous studies demonstrated that TRIM72, a muscle-enriched tripartite motif (TRIM) family protein also known as mitsugumin 53 (MG53), is a component of the cell membrane repair machinery in striated muscle. To test the importance of membrane repair in striated muscle in compensating for the membrane fragility in DMD, we crossed TRIM72/MG53 knockout mice into the mdx mouse model of DMD. These double knockout (DKO) mice showed compromised sarcolemmal membrane integrity compared to mdx mice, as measured by immunoglobulin G staining and ex vivo muscle laser microscopy wounding assays. We also found a significant decrease in muscle ex vivo contractile function as compared to mdx mice at both 6 weeks and 1.5 years of age. As the DKO mice aged, they developed more extensive fibrosis in skeletal muscles compared to mdx. Our findings indicate that TRIM72/MG53-mediated membrane repair can partially compensate for the sarcolemmal fragility associated with DMD and that the loss of membrane repair results in increased pathology in the DKO mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reticulon-1A mediates diabetic kidney disease progression through endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial contacts in tubular epithelial cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35469894/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35469894/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent epidemiological studies suggest that some patients with diabetes progress to kidney failure without significant albuminuria and glomerular injury, suggesting a critical role of kidney tubular epithelial cell (TEC) injury in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression. However, the major risk factors contributing to TEC injury and progression in DKD remain unclear. We previously showed that expression of endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein Reticulon-1A (RTN1A) increased in human DKD, and the increased RTN1A expression promoted TEC injury through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Here, we show that TEC-specific RTN1A overexpression worsened DKD in mice, evidenced by enhanced tubular injury, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and kidney function decline. But RTN1A overexpression did not exacerbate diabetes-induced glomerular injury or albuminuria. Notably, RTN1A overexpression worsened both ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in TECs under diabetic conditions by regulation of ER-mitochondria contacts. Mechanistically, ER-bound RTN1A interacted with mitochondrial hexokinase-1 and the voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), interfering with their association. This disengagement of VDAC1 from hexokinase-1 resulted in activation of apoptotic and inflammasome pathways, leading to TEC injury and loss. Thus, our observations highlight the importance of ER-mitochondrial crosstalk in TEC injury and the salient role of RTN1A-mediated ER-mitochondrial contact regulation in DKD progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Perivascular Fibrosis Is Mediated by a KLF10-IL-9 Signaling Axis in CD4&#43; T Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35440172/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35440172/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Perivascular fibrosis, characterized by increased amount of connective tissue around vessels, is a hallmark for vascular disease. Ang II (angiotensin II) contributes to vascular disease and end-organ damage via promoting T-cell activation. Despite recent data suggesting the role of T cells in the progression of perivascular fibrosis, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; TF (transcription factor) profiling was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of hypertensive patients. CD4-targeted KLF10 (Kruppel like factor 10)-deficient (&lt;em&gt;Klf10&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;CD4C&lt;sup&gt;re+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; [TKO]) and CD4-Cre (&lt;em&gt;Klf10&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;CD4C&lt;sup&gt;re+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; [Cre]) control mice were subjected to Ang II infusion. End point characterization included cardiac echocardiography, aortic imaging, multiorgan histology, flow cytometry, cytokine analysis, aorta and fibroblast transcriptomic analysis, and aortic single-cell RNA-sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; TF profiling identified increased &lt;em&gt;KLF10&lt;/em&gt; expression in hypertensive human subjects and in CD4+ T cells in Ang II-treated mice. TKO mice showed enhanced perivascular fibrosis, but not interstitial fibrosis, in aorta, heart, and kidney in response to Ang II, accompanied by alterations in global longitudinal strain, arterial stiffness, and kidney function compared with Cre control mice. However, blood pressure was unchanged between the 2 groups. Mechanistically, KLF10 bound to the IL (interleukin)-9 promoter and interacted with HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) inhibit IL-9 transcription. Increased IL-9 in TKO mice induced fibroblast intracellular calcium mobilization, fibroblast activation, and differentiation and increased production of collagen and extracellular matrix, thereby promoting the progression of perivascular fibrosis and impairing target organ function. Remarkably, injection of anti-IL9 antibodies reversed perivascular fibrosis in Ang II-infused TKO mice and C57BL/6 mice. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed fibroblast heterogeneity with activated signatures associated with robust ECM (extracellular matrix) and perivascular fibrosis in Ang II-treated TKO mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; CD4+ T cell deficiency of &lt;em&gt;Klf10&lt;/em&gt; exacerbated perivascular fibrosis and multi-organ dysfunction in response to Ang II via upregulation of IL-9. &lt;em&gt;Klf10&lt;/em&gt; or IL-9 in T cells might represent novel therapeutic targets for treatment of vascular or fibrotic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novelty and Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What Is Known?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perivascular fibrosis, often associated with hypertension, accelerates vascular aging, mediates vascular stiffness, induces vascular remodeling and target organ dysfunction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perivascular fibrosis has been linked to perivascular inflammation and T cell activation in hypertension, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KLF10 (Kruppel like factor 10) expression in CD4+ T cells regulates atherosclerotic lesion formation, obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver in mouse models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What New Information Does This Article Contribute?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deficiency of &lt;em&gt;Klf10&lt;/em&gt; in CD4+ T cells enhanced perivascular fibrosis in hearts, aortas, and kidneys after Ang II (angiotensin II) infusion and promoted multi-organ dysfunction independent of blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KLF10 deficiency in CD4+ T cells increases IL (interleukin)-9 expression and release, activating calcium flux and inducing a fibroblast activation signature, thereby accelerating perivascular fibrosis and end-organ damage in Ang II treated mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neutralization of endogenous IL-9 potently rescued the Ang II-induced end-organ dysfunction and perivascular fibrosis in TKO and C57BL/6 mice.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Therapeutic stem cell-derived alveolar-like macrophages display bactericidal effects and resolve Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial lung infections lead to greater than 4 million deaths per year with antibiotic treatments driving an increase in antibiotic resistance and a need to establish new therapeutic approaches. Recently, we have generated mouse and rat stem cell-derived alveolar-like macrophages (ALMs), which like primary alveolar macrophages (1&amp;rsquo;AMs), phagocytose bacteria and promote airway repair. Our aim was to further characterize ALMs and determine their bactericidal capabilities. The characterization of ALMs showed that they share known 1&amp;rsquo;AM cell surface markers, but unlike 1&amp;rsquo;AMs are highly proliferative in vitro. ALMs effectively phagocytose and kill laboratory strains of P. aeruginosa (P.A.), E. coli (E.C.) and S. aureus, and clinical strains of P.A. In vivo, ALMs remain viable, adapt additional features of native 1&amp;rsquo;AMs, but proliferation is reduced. Mouse ALMs phagocytose P.A. and E.C. and rat ALMs phagocytose and kill P.A. within the lung 24 h post-instillation. In a pre-clinical model of P.A.-induced lung injury, rat ALM administration mitigated weight loss and resolved lung injury observed seven days post-instillation. Collectively, ALMs attenuate pulmonary bacterial infections and promote airway repair. ALMs could be utilized as an alternative or adjuvant therapy where current treatments are ineffective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria or to enhance routine antibiotic delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a leading pulmonary inflammatory disorder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vincamine is a novel phytochemical with promising anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vincamine exerted potent suppression of inflammation by reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vincamine reduced the release of nitrite and TNF-α from lipopolysaccharide stimulated Raw 264.7 macrophages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vincamine reduced the expression of NF-κB, TNF-α and COX-2 while increased the expression of Nrf-2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These findings are of potential relevance for COVID-19 related lung injury management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the leading pulmonary inflammatory disorders causing significant morbidity and mortality. Vincamine is a novel phytochemical with promising anti-inflammatory properties. In the current work, the protective effect of vincamine was studied in vitro (Raw 264.7 macrophages) and in vivo against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced ALI in Swiss albino mice. Vincamine significantly reduced nitrite and TNF-α release from the LPS stimulated macrophages and increased the levels of IL-10, indicating potent anti-inflammatory effects. It was observed that vincamine at the dose of 40 mg/kg, significantly reduced LPS induced inflammatory cell count in blood and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Further, vincamine exerted potent suppression of inflammation by reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, while significantly increased (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and IL-22). Interestingly, histological changes were reversed in vincamine treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly enhanced expression of NF-κB, TNF-α and COX-2 while reduced expression of Nrf-2 in disease control group, which were significantly (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) ameliorated by vincamine. We, to the best of our knowledge, report for the first time that vincamine possesses protective potential against LPS induced inflammation and oxidative stress, possibly by inhibiting the NF-κB cascade, while positively regulating the Nrf-2 pathway. These findings are of potential relevance for COVID-19 management concerning the fact that lung injury and ARDS are its critical features.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Novel Identified Circular RNA, mmu_mmu_circRNA_0000309, Involves in Germacrone-Mediated Improvement of Diabetic Nephropathy Through Regulating Ferroptosis by Targeting miR-188-3p/GPX4 Signaling Axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34913724/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is characterized by microalbuminuria, mainly associated with pathological and morphological alterations of podocyte. New drug targeting podocyte injury is a promising approach for treating DN. The present study is aimed at developing new drug targeting podocyte injury for treating DN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, germacrone ameliorated kidney damage and inhibited podocyte apoptosis in a DN mouse model. Based on RNA-seq, mmu_mmu_circRNA_0000309, located in host gene vascular endothelial zinc finger 1 (Vezf1), showed a sharp decline in DN mice and a remarkable recovery in germacrone-challenged DN mice. mmu_circRNA_0000309 silence or miR-188-3p mimics abrogated the antiapoptosis and anti-injury effects of germacrone through aggravating mitochondria damage, and elevating reactive oxygen species and ferroptosis-related protein levels. Mechanistically, mmu_circRNA_0000309 competitively sponged miR-188-3p, and subsequently promoted glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression, thereby inactivating ferroptosis-dependent mitochondrial damage and podocyte apoptosis. In addition, GPX4 overexpression neutralized mmu_circRNA_0000309 silence-mediated mitochondria damage and ferroptosis in germacrone-exposed MPC5 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation:&lt;/em&gt; We describe the novel effect and mechanism of germacrone on treating DN, which is linked to ferroptosis for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; mmu_circRNA_0000309 silence mediates drug resistance to germacrone in DN mice. mmu_circRNA_0000309 sponges miR-188-3p, and subsequently upregulates GPX4 expression, inactivating ferroptosis-dependent mitochondrial function and podocyte apoptosis. Possibly germacrone-based treatment for DN can be further motivated by regulating mmu_circRNA_0000309/miR-188-3p/GPX4 signaling axis. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 36, 740-759.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>circHECTD1 attenuates apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells in acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35440759/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in many lung diseases. This study aimed to investigate the role of circHECTD1 in acute lung injury (ALI). The mouse and cell models of ALI were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) was detected by flow cytometry. The relationships between circHECTD1, miRNAs, and target genes were assessed by RNA pull-down, luciferase reporter gene, and RNA-FISH assays. circHECTD1 was downregulated in LPS-induced human and mouse AECs (HBE and MLE-12). The knockdown of circHECTD1 increased the apoptotic rates and the expressions of miR-136 and miR-320a, while its overexpression caused opposite effects in LPS-induced HBE and MLE-12 cells. Mechanistically, circHECTD1 bound to miR-320a and miR-136. miR-320a targeted PIK3CA and mediated the effect of circHECTD1 on PIK3CA expression. miR-136 targeted Sirt1 and mediated the effect of circHECTD1 on Sirt1 expression. Silencing PIK3CA and/or Sirt1 reversed the effect of circHECTD1 overexpression on the apoptosis of LPS-induced HBE and MLE-12 cells. In vivo, overexpression of circHECTD1 alleviated the LPS-induced ALI of mice. Our findings suggested that circHECTD1 inhibits the apoptosis of AECs through miR-320a/PIK3CA and miR-136/Sirt1 pathways in LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Galectin-3 interferes with tissue repair and promotes cardiac dysfunction and comorbidities in a genetic heart failure model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35441327/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galectin-3, a biomarker for heart failure (HF), has been associated with myocardial fibrosis. However, its causal involvement in HF pathogenesis has been questioned in certain models of cardiac injury-induced HF. To address this, we used desmin-deficient mice (&lt;em&gt;des&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), a model of progressive HF characterized by cardiomyocyte death, spontaneous inflammatory responses sustaining fibrosis, and galectin-3 overexpression. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of galectin-3 led to improvement of cardiac function and adverse remodeling features including fibrosis. Over the course of development of &lt;em&gt;des&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; cardiomyopathy, monitored for a period of 12 months, galectin-3 deficiency specifically ameliorated the decline in systolic function accompanying the acute inflammatory phase (4-week-old mice), whereas a more pronounced protective effect was observed in older mice, including the preservation of diastolic function. Interestingly, the cardiac repair activities during the early inflammatory phase were restored under galectin-3 deficiency by increasing the proliferation potential and decreasing apoptosis of fibroblasts, while galectin-3 absence modulated macrophage-fibroblast coupled functions and suppressed both pro-fibrotic activation of cardiac fibroblasts and pro-fibrotic gene expression in the &lt;em&gt;des&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; heart. In addition, galectin-3 also affected the emphysema-like comorbid pathology observed in the &lt;em&gt;des&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, as its absence partially normalized lung compliance. Collectively galectin-3 was found to be causally involved in cardiac adverse remodeling, inflammation, and failure by affecting functions of cardiac fibroblasts and macrophages. In concordance with this role, the effectiveness of pharmacological inhibition in ameliorating cardiac pathology features establishes galectin-3 as a valid intervention target for HF, with additive benefits for treatment of associated comorbidities, such as pulmonary defects. Schematic illustrating top to bottom, the detrimental role of galectin-3 (Gal3) in heart failure progression: desmin deficiency-associated spontaneous myocardial inflammation accompanying cardiac cell death (reddish dashed border) is characterized by infiltration of macrophages (round cells) and up-regulation of Lgals3 (encoding secretable galectin-3, green) and detrimental macrophage-related genes (Ccr2 and Arg1). In this galectin-3-enriched milieu, the early up-regulation of profibrotic gene expression (Tgfb1, Acta2, Col1a1), in parallel to the suppression of proliferative activities and a potential of senescence induction by cardiac fibroblasts (spindle-like cells), collectively promote &lt;em&gt;des&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction establishing heart failure (left panel). Additionally, galectin-3+ macrophage-enrichment accompanies the development of emphysema-like lung comorbidities. In the absence of galectin-3 (right panel), the effect of macrophage-fibroblast dipole and associated events are modulated (grey color depicts reduced expression or activities) leading to attenuated cardiac pathology in the &lt;em&gt;des&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Lgals3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;_ mice. Pulmonary comorbidities are also limited.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Imatinib alleviates lung injury and prolongs survival in ventilated rats</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, attenuates pulmonary edema and inflammation in lung injury. However, the physiological effects of this drug and their impact on outcomes are poorly characterized. Using serial computed tomography (CT), we tested the hypothesis that imatinib reduces injury severity and improves survival in ventilated rats. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was instilled in the trachea (pH 1.5, 2.5 mL/kg) of anesthetized, intubated supine rats. Animals were randomized (n = 17 each group) to receive intraperitoneal imatinib or vehicle immediately prior to HCl. All rats then received mechanical ventilation. CT was performed hourly for 4 h. Images were quantitatively analyzed to assess the progression of radiological abnormalities. Injury severity was confirmed via hourly blood gases, serum biomarkers, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and histopathology. Serial blood drug levels were measured in a subset of rats. Imatinib reduced mortality while delaying functional and radiological injury progression: out of 17 rats per condition, 2 control vs. 8 imatinib-treated rats survived until the end of the experiment (P = 0.02). Imatinib attenuated edema after lung injury (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and survival time in both groups was negatively correlated with increased lung mass (R2 = 0.70) as well as other physiological and CT parameters. Capillary leak (BAL protein concentration) was significantly lower in the treated group (P = 0.04). Peak drug concentration was reached after 70 min, and the drug half-life was 150 min. Imatinib decreased both mortality and lung injury severity in mechanically ventilated rats. Pharmacological inhibition of edema could be used during mechanical ventilation to improve the severity and outcome of lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil phenotypes in bronchial airways differentiate single from dual responding allergic asthmatics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35437872/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35437872/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Allergic asthmatics with both an early (EAR) and a late allergic reaction (LAR) following allergen exposure are termed &amp;lsquo;dual responders&amp;rsquo; (DR), while &amp;lsquo;single responders&amp;rsquo; (SR) only have an EAR. Mechanisms that differentiate DR from SR are largely unknown, particularly regarding the role and phenotypes of neutrophils. Therefore, we aimed to study neutrophils in DR and SR asthmatics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Thirty-four allergic asthmatics underwent an inhaled allergen challenge, samples were collected before and up to 24 h post-challenge. Cell differentials were counted from bronchial lavage, alveolar lavage and blood; and tissue neutrophils were quantified in immune-stained bronchial biopsies. Lavage neutrophil nuclei lobe segmentation was used to classify active (1-4 lobes) from suppressive neutrophils (≥5 lobes). Levels of transmigration markers: soluble (s)CD62L and interleukin-1Ra, and activity markers: neutrophil elastase (NE), DNA-histone complex and dsDNA were measured in lavage fluid and plasma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with SR at baseline, DR had more neutrophils in their bronchial airways at baseline, both in the lavage (p = .0031) and biopsies (p = .026) and elevated bronchial neutrophils correlated with less antitransmigratory IL-1Ra levels (r = -0.64). DR airways had less suppressive neutrophils and more 3-lobed (active) neutrophils (p = .029) that correlated with more bronchial lavage histone (p = .020) and more plasma NE (p = .0016). Post-challenge, DR released neutrophil extracellular trap factors in the blood earlier and had less pro-transmigratory sCD62L during the late phase (p = .0076) than in SR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; DR have a more active airway neutrophil phenotype at baseline and a distinct neutrophil response to allergen challenge that may contribute to the development of an LAR. Therefore, neutrophil activity should be considered during targeted diagnosis and bio-therapeutic development for DR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Messages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dual responding allergic asthmatics have more baseline airway neutrophils with an active morphology than single responders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased airway neutrophils in dual responders were associated with less antimigration signalling rather than more chemoattraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-challenge, dual responders release an active neutrophil response in the blood earlier than in single responders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Toxicological Mechanism of Individual Susceptibility to Formaldehyde-Induced Respiratory Effects</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35438505/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the mechanisms of individual susceptibility to exposure to environmental pollutants has been a challenge in health risk assessment. Here, an integrated approach combining a CRISPR screen in human cells and epidemiological analysis was developed to identify the individual susceptibility to the adverse health effects of air pollutants by taking formaldehyde (FA) and the associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a case study. Among the primary hits of CRISPR screening of FA in human A549 cells, HTR4 was the only gene genetically associated with COPD susceptibility in global populations. However, the association between HTR4 and FA-induced respiratory toxicity is unknown in the literature. Adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network analysis of CRISPR screen hits provided a potential mechanistic link between activation of HTR4 (molecular initiating event) and FA-induced lung injury (adverse outcome). Systematic toxicology tests (in vitro and animal experiments) were conducted to reveal the HTR4-involved biological mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to adverse health effects of FA. Functionality and enhanced expression of HTR4 were required for susceptibility to FA-induced lung injury, and FA-induced epigenetic changes could result in enhanced expression of HTR4. Specific epigenetic and genetic characteristics of HTR4 were associated with the progression and prevalence of COPD, respectively, and these genetic risk factors for COPD could be potential biomarkers of individual susceptibility to adverse respiratory effects of FA. These biomarkers could be of great significance for defining subpopulations susceptible to exposure to FA and reducing uncertainty in the next-generation health risk assessment of air pollutants. Our study delineated a novel toxicological pathway mediated by HTR4 in FA-induced lung injury, which could provide a mechanistic understanding of the potential biomarkers of individual susceptibility to adverse respiratory effects of FA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alveolar macrophage-derived NRP2 curtails lung injury while boosting host defense in bacterial pneumonia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearance of airway intruders by immune cells is required to resolve infectious pneumonia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Here, we demonstrated that alveolar macrophage (AM)-derived neuropilin 2 (NRP2) plays an essential role in controlling severe pneumonia by enhancing microbial clearance. Mice with conditional deletion of the &lt;em&gt;NRP2&lt;/em&gt; gene in AM had persistent bacteria, uncontrolled neutrophil influx, and decreased survival during &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;-induced pneumonia. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; assays demonstrated that NRP2 could bind to CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6G&lt;sup&gt;lo/+&lt;/sup&gt; neutrophils and promote their capacities in phagocytosis and killing of bacteria, which is partially contributed to the increased expression of &lt;em&gt;TLR4&lt;/em&gt; and TNF-α. These findings collectively revealed that AM-derived NRP2 protects the lungs from unwanted injury by promoting the clearance of invading pathogens. This study might provide a promising diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for severe pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HLA-A2 Promotes the Therapeutic Effect of Umbilical Cord Blood-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Hyperoxic Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most extensively studied stem cell types owing to their capacity for differentiation into multiple lineages as well as their ability to secrete regenerative factors and modulate immune functions. However, issues remain regarding their further application for cell therapy. Here, to demonstrate the superiority of the improvement of MSCs, we divided umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (UCB-MSCs) from 15 donors into two groups based on efficacy and revealed donor-dependent variations in the anti-inflammatory effect of MSCs on macrophages as well as their immunoregulatory effect on T cells. Through surface marker analyses (242 antibodies), we found that HLA-A2 was positively related to the anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory function of MSCs. Additionally, HLA-A2 mRNA silencing in MSCs attenuated their therapeutic effects in vitro; namely, the suppression of LPS-stimulated macrophages and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cells. Moreover, HLA-A2 silencing in MSCs significantly decreased their therapeutic effects in a rat model of hyperoxic lung damage. The present study provides novel insights into the quality control of donor-derived MSCs for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Steen solution protects pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and preserves endothelial barrier after lipopolysaccharide-induced injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35577593/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; Acute respiratory distress syndrome represents the devastating result of acute lung injury, with high mortality. Limited methods are available for rehabilitation of lungs affected by acute respiratory distress syndrome. Our laboratory has demonstrated rehabilitation of sepsis-injured lungs via normothermic ex vivo and in vivo perfusion with Steen solution (Steen). However, mechanisms responsible for the protective effects of Steen remain unclear. This study tests the hypothesis that Steen directly attenuates pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction and inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Primary pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide for 4 hours and then recovered for 8 hours in complete media (Media), Steen, or Steen followed by complete media (Steen/Media). Oxidative stress, chemokines, permeability, interendothelial junction proteins, and toll-like receptor 4-mediated pathways were assessed in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells using standard methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Lipopolysaccharide treatment of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and recovery in Media significantly induced reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, expression of chemokines (eg, chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 1 and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2) and cell adhesion molecules (P-selectin, E-selectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), permeability, neutrophil transmigration, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappa B signaling, and decreased expression of tight and adherens junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, zonula occludens-2, and vascular endothelial-cadherin). All of these inflammatory pathways were significantly attenuated after recovery of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells in Steen or Steen/Media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Steen solution preserves pulmonary endothelial barrier function after lipopolysaccharide exposure by promoting an anti-inflammatory environment via attenuation of oxidative stress, toll-like receptor 4-mediated signaling, and conservation of interendothelial junctions. These protective mechanisms offer insight into the advancement of methods for in vivo lung perfusion with Steen for the treatment of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impairment of Mitochondrial ATP Synthesis Induces RIPK3-dependent Necroptosis in Lung Epithelial Cells During Lung Injury by Lung Inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35573150/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysfunction of mitochondrial metabolism is implicated in cellular injury and cell death. While mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with lung injury by lung inflammation, the mechanism by which the impairment of mitochondrial ATP synthesis regulates necroptosis during acute lung injury (ALI) by lung inflammation is unclear. Here, we showed that the impairment of mitochondrial ATP synthesis induces receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 3 (RIPK3)-dependent necroptosis during lung injury by lung inflammation. We found that the impairment of mitochondrial ATP synthesis by oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP synthase, resulted in increased lung injury and RIPK3 levels in lung tissues during lung inflammation by LPS in mice. The elevated RIPK3 and RIPK3 phosphorylation levels by oligomycin resulted in high mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) phosphorylation, the terminal molecule in necroptotic cell death pathway, in lung epithelial cells during lung inflammation. Moreover, the levels of protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were increased by the activation of necroptosis via oligomycin during lung inflammation. Furthermore, the levels of ATP5A, a catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex for ATP synthesis, were reduced in lung epithelial cells of lung tissues from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of ALI. The levels of RIPK3, RIPK3 phosphorylation and MLKL phosphorylation were elevated in lung epithelial cells in patients with ARDS. Our results suggest that the impairment of mitochondrial ATP synthesis induces RIPK3-dependent necroptosis in lung epithelial cells during lung injury by lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>cGAS modulates cytokine secretion and bacterial burdens by altering the release of mitochondrial DNA in pseudomonas pulmonary infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35420160/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is essential for fighting against viruses and bacteria, but how cGAS is involved in host immune response remains largely elusive. Here, we uncover the crucial role of cGAS in host immunity based on a &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; pulmonary infection model. &lt;em&gt;cGAS&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice showed more heavy bacterial burdens and serious lung injury accompanied with exorbitant proinflammatory cytokines than wild-type mice. cGAS deficiency caused an accumulation of mitochondrial DNA in the cytoplasm, which, in turn, induced excessive secretion of proinflammatory factors by activating inflammasome and TLR9 signalling. Mechanistically, cGAS deficiency inhibited the recruitment of LC3 by reducing the binding capacity of TBK-1 to p62, leading to impaired mitophagy and augmented release of mitochondrial DNA. Importantly, cytoplasmic mitochondrial DNA also acted as a feedback signal that induced the activation of cGAS. Altogether, these findings identify protective and homeostasis functions of cGAS against &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; infection, adding significant insight into the pathogenesis of bacterial infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Secretome of Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Consecutive Hypoxic Cultures Promotes Resolution of Lung Inflammation by Reprogramming Anti-Inflammatory Macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35457151/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secretome from hypoxia-preconditioned mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been shown to promote resolution of inflammation and alleviate acute lung injury (ALI) through its immunomodulatory function. However, the effects of consecutive hypoxic culture on immunomodulatory function of the MSCs secretome are largely unclarified. Here, we intend to investigate the effects of consecutive hypoxia on therapeutic efficacy of conditioned medium derived from MSCs (MSCs-CM) in alleviating ALI. Human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) were consecutively cultured in 21% O2 (Nor-MSCs) or in 1% O2 (Hypo-MSCs) from passage 0. Their conditioned medium (Nor-CM and Hypo-CM respectively) was collected and administered into ALI models. Our findings confirmed that Hypo-MSCs exhibited increased proliferation ability and decreased cell senescence compared with Nor-MSCs. Consecutive hypoxia promoted UC-MSCs to secrete immunomodulatory cytokines, such as insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF1), IL10, TNFα-stimulated gene 6(TSG6), TGFβ, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Both Nor-CM and Hypo-CM could effectively limit lung inflammation, promote efferocytosis and modulate anti-inflammatory polarization of lung macrophages in ALI models. Moreover, the effects of Hypo-CM were more potent than Nor-CM. Taken together, our findings indicate that consecutive hypoxic cultures could not only promote both proliferation and quality of UC-MSCs, but also enhance the therapeutic efficacy of their secretome in mitigating lung inflammation by promoting efferocytosis and anti-inflammatory polarization of macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Geraniol Ameliorates Doxorubicin-Mediated Kidney Injury through Alteration of Antioxidant Status, Inflammation, and Apoptosis: Potential Roles of NF-κB and Nrf2/Ho-1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doxorubicin-mediated kidney impairment is a serious problem in cancer treatment. Accordingly, this work investigated the ability of geraniol to modulate doxorubicin-induced kidney damage using a rat model. Rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control, doxorubicin (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, i.p.), doxorubicin plus 100 mg/kg of geraniol, and doxorubicin plus 200 mg/kg of geraniol. A single doxorubicin injection triggered kidney impairment, as evidenced by the altered serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and albumin values; it also caused histological changes in the kidney architecture. Additionally, doxorubicin enhanced lipid peroxidation while lowering reduced glutathione, catalase activity, and the expression of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. Interestingly, pre-treatment with geraniol rescued doxorubicin-induced alterations in kidney antioxidant parameters, enzymatic activity, and the expression of inflammatory and apoptosis-mediating gene and proteins. Moreover, prophylactic treatment with geraniol preserved most kidney histological characteristics in a dose-dependent manner. These findings support that geraniol could protect against doxorubicin-mediated kidney dysfunction. However, further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms of geraniol&amp;rsquo;s protective effects against doxorubicin-mediated kidney dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of METTL3 attenuates renal injury and inflammation by alleviating TAB3 m6A modifications via IGF2BP2-dependent mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35417191/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in renal diseases is largely unknown. Here, we characterized the role of N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-adenosine-methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), whose expression is elevated in renal tubules in different acute kidney injury (AKI) models as well as in human biopsies and cultured tubular epithelial cells (TECs). &lt;em&gt;METTL3&lt;/em&gt; silencing alleviated renal inflammation and programmed cell death in TECs in response to stimulation by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cisplatin, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whereas METTL3 overexpression had the opposite effects. Conditional knockout of &lt;em&gt;METTL3&lt;/em&gt; from mouse kidneys attenuated cisplatin- and ischemic/reperfusion (I/R)-induced renal dysfunction, injury, and inflammation. Moreover, &lt;em&gt;TAB3&lt;/em&gt; [TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 3] was identified as a target of METTL3 by m6A methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing. The stability of TAB3 was increased through binding of IGF2BP2 (insulin-like growth factor 2 binding protein 2) to its m6A-modified stop codon regions. The proinflammatory effects of TAB3 were then explored both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated &lt;em&gt;METTL3&lt;/em&gt; silencing attenuated renal injury and inflammation in cisplatin- and LPS-induced AKI mouse models. We further identified Cpd-564 as a METTL3 inhibitor that had better protective effects against cisplatin- and ischemia/reperfusion-induced renal injury and inflammation than S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, a previously identified METTL3 inhibitor. Collectively, METTL3 promoted m6A modifications of TAB3 and enhanced its stability via IGF2BP2-dependent mechanisms. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of METTL3 attenuated renal injury and inflammation, suggesting that the METTL3/TAB3 axis is a potential target for treatment of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Potential Pro-Inflammatory Effect of Vitamin E Analogs through Mitigation of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Binding to the Cannabinoid 2 Receptor</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35457108/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin E acetate, which is used as a diluent of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has been reported as the primary causative agent of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). Here, we employ in vitro assays, docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations to investigate the interaction of vitamin E with the membrane-bound cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R), and its role in modulating the binding affinity of THC to CB2R. From the MD simulations, we determined that vitamin E interacts with both CB2R and membrane phospholipids. Notably, the synchronized effect of these interactions likely facilitates vitamin E acting as a lipid modulator for the cannabinoid system. Furthermore, MD simulation and trajectory analysis show that when THC binds to CB2R in the presence of vitamin E, the binding cavity widens, facilitating the entry of water molecules into it, leading to a reduced interaction of THC with CB2R. Additionally, the interaction between THC and vitamin E in solution is stabilized by several H bonds, which can directly limit the interaction of free THCs with CB2R. Overall, both the MD simulations and the in vitro dissociation assay results indicate that THC binding to CB2R is reduced in the presence of vitamin E. Our study discusses the role of vitamin E in limiting the effect of THCs and its implications on the reported pathology of EVALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CircEXOC5 promotes ferroptosis by enhancing ACSL4 mRNA stability via binding to PTBP1 in sepsis-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35709678/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis causes severe acute lung injury (ALI). Circular RNA is involved in the regulation of sepsis-related ALI progression. The regulation mechanism of circEXOC5 in sepsis-induced ALI is still unclear. Whether circEXOC5 is involved in the regulation of ferroptosis remains to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We constructed a mouse model of sepsis through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). LPS induced mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells (MPVECs) to construct a sepsis cell model. The expression of circEXOC5 in the sepsis model was detected by qPCR. The extent of lung injury in mice was analyzed by HE staining. The contents of GSH/GSSG, iron, MDA and 4HNE in mice lung tissues and cells were detected by the kit. And further the ROS content was detected in the cells. Finally, the binding relationship between circEXOC5 and PTBP1 was detected by RIP and RNA pulldown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our results showed that the circEXOC5 expression was significantly increased in the &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; models of sepsis. And after inhibiting circEXOC5, it improved the lung injury of septic mice. It was confirmed in cell models that ROS levels and ferroptosis in cells were reduced after knocking down circEXOC5. In addition, the expressions of ACSL4 and Gpx4 proteins were regulated by the level of circEXOC5. Finally, we also found that circEXOC5 had a direct binding relationship with PTBP1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study found that the expression of cell ferroptosis and circEXOC5 increased in ALI induced by sepsis, and circEXOC5 aggravated ferroptosis in septic cells by regulating the PTBP1/ACSL4 axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of mango and mint pod-based e-cigarette aerosol inhalation on inflammatory states of the brain, lung, heart, and colon in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While health effects of conventional tobacco are well defined, data on vaping devices, including one of the most popular e-cigarettes which have high nicotine levels, are less established. Prior acute e-cigarette studies have demonstrated inflammatory and cardiopulmonary physiology changes while chronic studies have demonstrated extra-pulmonary effects, including neurotransmitter alterations in reward pathways. In this study we investigated the impact of inhalation of aerosols produced from pod-based, flavored e-cigarettes (JUUL) aerosols three times daily for 3 months on inflammatory markers in the brain, lung, heart, and colon. JUUL aerosol exposure induced upregulation of cytokine and chemokine gene expression and increased HMGB1 and RAGE in the nucleus accumbens in the central nervous system. Inflammatory gene expression increased in the colon, while gene expression was more broadly altered by e-cigarette aerosol inhalation in the lung. Cardiopulmonary inflammatory responses to acute lung injury with lipopolysaccharide were exacerbated in the heart. Flavor-specific findings were detected across these studies. Our findings suggest that daily e-cigarette use may cause neuroinflammation, which may contribute to behavioral changes and mood disorders. In addition, e-cigarette use may cause gut inflammation, which has been tied to poor systemic health, and cardiac inflammation, which leads to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Every road leads to Rome: therapeutic effect and mechanism of the extracellular vesicles of human embryonic stem cell-derived immune and matrix regulatory cells administered to mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis through different routes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35413874/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial lung disease. Whether extracellular vesicles are effective in treating IPF and what is the optimal administrative route is not clear. Our previous studies have shown that immunity and matrix regulatory cells (IMRCs) derived from human embryonic stem cells can safely treat lung injury and fibrosis in mouse models, and its mechanism of action is related to the paracrine effect. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of IMRC-derived extracellular vesicles (IMRC-EVs) on a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model and explored the optimal route of administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To study the biodistribution of IMRC-EVs after administration via different routes, NIR labeled-IMRC-EVs were delivered by intratracheal (IT) or intravenous (IV) route, and in vivo imaging was acquired at different time points. The therapeutic effects of IMRC-EVs delivered by different routes were analyzed by assessing histology, lung function, cytokines levels, and transcriptome profiling. RNA-seq of lung tissues was performed to investigate the mechanisms of EV treatment through IT or IV administrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; IMRC-EVs mainly reserved in the liver and spleen when administrated via IV route; and mainly retained in the lungs via the IT route. IMRC-EVs administrated via both routes demonstrated a therapeutic effect as attenuated pulmonary fibrosis, improved lung function, and histological parameters. Based on our RNA-seq results, different pathways may be affected by IMRC-EVs administrated via IT or IV routes. In addition, in vitro experiments showed that IMRC-EVs inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by TGF-β.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; IMRC-EVs administrated via IT or IV routes generate different biodistributions, but are both effective for the treatment of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The therapeutic mechanisms of IMRC-EVs administrated via different routes may be different.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The inhibition of TRIM35-mediated TIGAR ubiquitination enhances mitochondrial fusion and alleviates renal ischemia-reperfusion injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tripartite motif 35 (TRIM35) is a member of the tripartite motif protein family and has been recognized to play a key role in immune-inflammatory diseases. However, the role of TRIM35 in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) remains unclear. Our study proved that knockdown of TRIM35 alleviates kidney IRI by inhibiting oxidative stress and enhancing mitochondrial fusion. In addition, our experimental results found that TRIM35 interacts with TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) and promotes the polyubiquitination of TIGAR and induces its degradation in the proteasome pathway. Furthermore, TIGAR knockdown significantly inhibited mitochondrial fusion. These results indicate that TRIM35 is a potential therapeutic target for renal IRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Notch pathway attenuates burn-induced acute lung injury in rats by repressing reactive oxygen species</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35441079/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35441079/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This study demonstrated for the first time that the Notch pathway is activated in burn-induced ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROS production and cell apoptosis of PMVECs were closely associated with the Notch signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of the Notch pathway downregulated the expression of ROS and attenuated excessive ROS-induced injury in PMVECs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notch signaling regulated ROS production by modulating the expression of NOX4 rather than NOX2 and SOD1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common complication following severe burns. The underlying mechanisms of ALI are incompletely understood; thus, available treatments are not sufficient to repair the lung tissue after ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate the relationship between the Notch pathway and burn-induced lung injury, we established a rat burn injury model by scalding and verified lung injury via lung injury evaluations, including hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining, lung injury scoring, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and wet/dry ratio analyses, myeloperoxidase immunohistochemical staining and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation analysis. To explore whether burn injury affects Notch1 expression, we detected the expression of Notch1 and Hes1 after burn injury. Then, we extracted pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) and conducted Notch pathway inhibition and activation experiments, via a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) and OP9-DLL1 coculture, respectively, to verify the regulatory effect of the Notch pathway on ROS accumulation and apoptosis in burn-serum-stimulated PMVECs. To investigate the regulatory effect of the Notch pathway on ROS accumulation, we detected the expression of oxidative-stress-related molecules such as superoxide dismutase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) 2, NOX4 and cleaved caspase-3. NOX4-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the inhibitor GKT137831 were used to verify the regulatory effect of the Notch pathway on ROS via NOX4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We successfully established a burn model and revealed that lung injury, excessive ROS accumulation and an inflammatory response occurred. Notch1 detection showed that the expression of Notch1 was significantly increased after burn injury. In PMVECs challenged with burn serum, ROS and cell death were elevated. Moreover, when the Notch pathway was suppressed by GSI, ROS and cell apoptosis levels were significantly increased. Conversely, these parameters were reduced when the Notch pathway was activated by OP9-DLL1. Mechanistically, the inhibition of NOX4 by siRNA and GKT137831 showed that the Notch pathway reduced ROS production and cell apoptosis by downregulating the expression of NOX4 in PMVECs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The Notch pathway reduced ROS production and apoptosis by downregulating the expression of NOX4 in burn-stimulated PMVECs. The Notch-NOX4 pathway may be a novel therapeutic target to treat burn-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Biomimic Trained Immunity-MSCs Delivery Microcarriers for Acute Liver Failure Regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35411651/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have a demonstrated value for acute liver failure (ALF) regeneration, while their delivery stratagems with long-term biological functions, low immune response, and high biocompatibility are still a challenge. Here, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-loaded photoresponsive cryogel porous microcarrier (CPM) for MSCs delivery and colonization is presented to promote defect liver regeneration. The CPMs are fabricated with graphene oxide, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) via droplet microfluidic technology and a gradient-cooling procedure. Benefitting from the biocompatible GelMA component and the porous microstructure of the CPMs, MSCs can be nondestructively captured and abundantly delivered. Because the LPS can be released from the CPMs under NIR irradiation, the delivered MSCs are imparted with the feature of &amp;ldquo;trained immunity.&amp;rdquo; Thus, when the MSCs-laden CPMs are tailored into the liver matched patches by bioprinting and applied in ALF rats, they display superior anti-inflammatory and more significant liver regeneration properties than the untrained MSCs. These features make the CPMs an excellent MSCs delivery system for clinical applications in tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine (Dex) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in rats and its mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Eighteen SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (6 rats in each group): control group (intratracheal instillation of saline), ALI group (intratracheal instillation of 5 mg/kg LPS), and ALI-Dex group (tail vein injection of 50 μg/kg/h Dex + intratracheal instillation of LPS). Subsequently, the water content of lung tissues was assessed using the wet-dry (W/D) ratio and the histopathological changes of lung tissues using H&amp;amp;E staining. Further activities of ROS, SOD, and GSH-Px in lung tissues of rats were measured by an automatic biochemistry analyzer. ELISA was performed to detect TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 expression in alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and Western blot to detect the expression of Nrf2/ARE pathway-related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; After Dex treatment, a reduction in water content in lung tissue and an improvement of lung injury were found in the ALI rats. Compared with the ALI group, rats in the ALI-Dex group had decreased ROS activity and increased activities of SOD and GSH-Px in lung tissues. Dex-treated rats were also associated with a decrease in TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 expression in alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Additionally, increased expression levels of HO-1 and NQO1 in lung tissues and elevated expression of Nrf2 in the nucleus were shown in the ALI-Dex group compared with the ALI group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Dex alleviates LPS-induced ALI by activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AMG487 inhibits PRRSV replication and ameliorates lung injury in pig lung xenografts by down-regulating the expression of ANXA2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35405171/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a pig disease caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV) that is characterized with diffuse interstitial pneumonia and lung edema. High expressions of chemokine CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 are reported in infected porcine lungs. Since CXCR3 is a key player in host inflammatory response, it might be a therapeutic target to treat lung damage caused by PRRSV infection. The size of pigs has long hampered research into molecular mechanisms of PRRS and validating the potential pharmaceutical targets. In this study, a porcine lung xenograft model with PRRSV infection was generated in immunodeficient mice to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 on PRRSV infection-induced lung injury. The porcine lung tissues developed normally two weeks after xeno-transplantation in the mouse kidney capsule. Infection of PRRSV resulted in its efficient replication in the xenografts and histological damage to the porcine lung tissue structure, with no or little effects on mouse lungs. AMG487 administration dramatically reduced the number of PRRSV genome copies and significantly alleviated the porcine lung injury. Furthermore, treatment of AMG487 in cultured porcine macrophages consistently suppressed PRRSV replication with significant downregulation of Annexin A2 (ANXA2), a cellular protein facilitating viral replication. These findings provide a suitable model for evaluating new antiviral therapies as well as a possible therapeutic option for virus infection-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MANF was up-regulated in inflammatory lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MANF deficiency in macrophages induced lung inflammation and aggravated LPS-induced lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recombinant human MANF attenuated LPS-induced lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MANF deficiency in macrophages promoted macrophages to M1differentiation in lung tissues of ALI mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recombinant human MANF restricted macrophages to M1 differentiation in lung tissues of ALI mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is an urgent respiratory disease without effective treatment. Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF)has been demonstrated to play a suppressive role in some inflammatory conditions. However, the effect of MANF on ALI has not yet been reported. In this study, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the patients with or without pulmonary inflammation, and used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce mice ALI model. Mono-macrophage-specific MANF knockout (MKO) mice were constructed and recombinant human MANF protein was used to ALI mice. We found that the endogenous MANF protein in both human BALF and mice lung tissues was increased in inflammatory conditions. MANF level in the macrophages of inflammatory lung was higher than that in normal controls in both human and mice. MANF deficiency in macrophages induced lung inflammation and aggravated LPS-induced lung injury. MANF lowered LPS-induced lung injury, inhibited macrophage polarization to M1 functional type. Meanwhile, MANF inhibited-LPS induced activation of NF-κB signal pathway by down regulating phosphorylated p65in lung tissue and macrophages. These results indicate that MANF acts as a suppressor in ALI via negatively regulating NF-κB activation and macrophages polarization, which may be a novel potential target and shed light on ALI therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ameliorative Effect of Dexamethasone on the Development of Autoimmune Lung Injury and Mediastinal Fat-Associated Lymphoid Clusters in an Autoimmune Disease Mouse Model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35457267/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our previous study, we revealed the ameliorative therapeutic effect of dexamethasone (Dex) for Lupus nephritis lesions in the MRL/MpJ-&lt;em&gt;Fas&lt;sup&gt;lpr/lpr&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Lpr) mouse model. The female Lpr mice developed a greater number of mediastinal fat-associated lymphoid clusters (MFALCs) and inflammatory lung lesions compared to the male mice. However, the effect of Dex, an immunosuppressive drug, on both lung lesions and the development of MFALCs in Lpr mice has not been identified yet. Therefore, in this study, we compared the development of lung lesions and MFALCs in female Lpr mice that received either saline (saline group &amp;ldquo;SG&amp;rdquo;) or dexamethasone (dexamethasone group &amp;ldquo;DG&amp;rdquo;) in drinking water as a daily dose along with weekly intraperitoneal injections for 10 weeks. Compared to the SG group, the DG group showed a significant reduction in the levels of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies, the size of MFALCs, the degree of lung injury, the area of high endothelial venules (HEVs), and the number of proliferating and immune cells in both MFALCs and the lungs. A significant positive correlation was observed between the size of MFALCs and the cellular aggregation in the lungs of Lpr mice. Therefore, this study confirmed the ameliorative effect of Dex on the development of lung injury and MFALCs via their regressive effect on both immune cells&amp;rsquo; proliferative activity and the development of HEVs. Furthermore, the reprogramming of MFALCs by targeting immune cells and HEVs may provide a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune-disease-associated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of BKCa channels protects neonatal hearts against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35393410/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels are large-conductance calcium and voltage-activated potassium channels that are heterogeneously expressed in a wide array of cells. Activation of BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels present in mitochondria of adult ventricular cardiomyocytes is implicated in cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. However, the BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channel&amp;rsquo;s activity has never been detected in the plasma membrane of adult ventricular cardiomyocytes. In this study, we report the presence of the BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channel in the plasma membrane and mitochondria of neonatal murine and rodent cardiomyocytes, which protects the heart on inhibition but not activation. Furthermore, K+ currents measured in neonatal cardiomyocyte (NCM) was sensitive to iberiotoxin (IbTx), suggesting the presence of BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels in the plasma membrane. Neonatal hearts subjected to IR when post-conditioned with NS1619 during reoxygenation increased the myocardial infarction whereas IbTx reduced the infarct size. In agreement, isolated NCM also presented increased apoptosis on treatment with NS1619 during hypoxia and reoxygenation, whereas IbTx reduced TUNEL-positive cells. In NCMs, activation of BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species post HR injury. Electrophysiological characterization of NCMs indicated that NS1619 increased the beat period, field, and action potential duration, and decreased the conduction velocity and spike amplitude. In contrast, IbTx had no impact on the electrophysiological properties of NCMs. Taken together, our data established that inhibition of plasma membrane BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels in the NCM protects neonatal heart/cardiomyocytes from IR injury. Furthermore, the functional disparity observed towards the cardioprotective activity of BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels in adults compared to neonatal heart could be attributed to their differential localization.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loss of Sam50 in hepatocytes induces cardiolipin-dependent mitochondrial membrane remodeling to trigger mtDNA release and liver injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35313046/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35313046/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam50, a key component of the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) complex, is also involved in bridging mitochondrial outer-membrane and inner-membrane contacts. However, the physiological and pathological functions of Sam50 remain largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we show that Sam50 interacts with MICOS (mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system) and ATAD3 (ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 3) to form the Sam50-MICOS-ATAD3-mtDNA axis, which maintains mtDNA stability. Loss of Sam50 causes mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) aggregation. Furthermore, Sam50 cooperates with Mic60 to bind to cardiolipin, maintaining the integrity of mitochondrial membranes. Sam50 depletion leads to cardiolipin externalization, which causes mitochondrial outer-membrane and inner-membrane (including crista membrane) remodeling, triggering Bax mitochondrial recruitment, mtDNA aggregation, and release. Physiologically, acetaminophen (an effective antipyretic and analgesic)-caused Sam50 reduction or Sam50 liver-specific knockout induces mtDNA release, leading to activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and liver inflammation in mice. Moreover, exogenous expression of Sam50 remarkably attenuates APAP-induced liver hepatoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings uncover the critical role of Sam50 in maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and mtDNA stability in hepatocytes and reveal that Sam50 depletion-induced cardiolipin externalization is a signal of mtDNA release and controls mtDNA-dependent innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanism of taurine reducing inflammation and organ injury in sepsis mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35421705/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental basis for the pathogenesis of sepsis is an inflammatory imbalance, which is considered to be the main target for treatment. Taurine is an intracellular free amino acid that has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. To investigate the protective mechanism of taurine in sepsis, we used in vitro and in vivo experiments to explore the effects of taurine on neutrophil and monocyte immune function. Metabolomic analysis showed large amounts of taurine in neutrophils and monocytes and a dramatic decrease in taurine levels after LPS exposure. Taurine supplementation decreased the expressions of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in LPS-challenged neutrophils and monocytes and reduced the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by restricting reactive oxygen species. Moreover, taurine protected septic mice from death, improved tissue injuries in the lung, liver, and kidney by reducing neutrophil infiltration and TNF-α production. Our data indicate that a supplement with taurine might be a promising therapeutic strategy for sepsis to reduce hyper inflammation and improve multi-organ dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The ZIP8/SIRT1 axis regulates alveolar progenitor cell renewal in aging and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35389887/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) function as progenitor cells in the lung. We have shown previously that failure of AEC2 regeneration results in progressive lung fibrosis in mice and is a cardinal feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In this study, we identified deficiency of a specific zinc transporter, SLC39A8 (ZIP8), in AEC2s from both IPF lungs and lungs of old mice. Loss of ZIP8 expression was associated with impaired renewal capacity of AEC2s and enhanced lung fibrosis. ZIP8 regulation of AEC2 progenitor function was dependent on SIRT1. Replenishment with exogenous zinc and SIRT1 activation promoted self-renewal and differentiation of AEC2s from lung tissues of IPF patients and old mice. Deletion of Zip8 in AEC2s in mice resulted in impaired AEC2 renewal, increased susceptibility to bleomycin injury, and development of spontaneous lung fibrosis. Therapeutic strategies to restore zinc metabolism and appropriate SIRT1 signaling could improve AEC2 progenitor function and mitigate ongoing fibrogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondria bridge HIF signaling and ferroptosis blockage in acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35387983/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, plays an important role in acute kidney injury (AKI). Previous studies have shown that prolyl hydroxylase domain protein (PHD) inhibitors that activate HIF signaling provide strong protection against AKI, which is characterized by marked cell death. However, the relationship between PHD inhibition/HIF signaling and ferroptosis in AKI has not been elucidated. Here, we review recent studies to explore the issue. First, we will review the literature concerning the functions of HIF in promoting mitophagy, suppressing mitochondrial respiration and modulating redox homeostasis. Second, we will describe the current understanding of ferroptosis and its role in AKI, particularly from the perspective of mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, we will discuss the possibility that mitochondria link PHD inhibition/HIF signaling and ferroptosis in AKI. In conclusion, we propose that HIF may protect renal cells against ferroptosis in AKI by reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress and damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferroptosis plays an important role in the development of AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of HIF signaling provides protection against AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitochondrial ROS facilitate ferroptosis in many cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HIF signaling regulates multiple mitochondrial activities, including mitochondrial oxidative capacity, redox homeostasis and autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can HIF signaling alleviate ferroptosis in AKI with different etiologies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is mitochondrial pathway decisive for HIF-offered protection in situations like AKI, given that HIF signaling has extensive downstream effects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would PHD inhibitors be effective in AKI prevention and treatment clinically?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Sorafenib-loaded silica-containing redox nanoparticles for oral anti-liver fibrosis therapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35395328/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver fibrosis is a chronic disease resulting from repetitive or prolonged liver injury with limited treatment options. Sorafenib has been reported to be a potential antifibrotic agent; however, its therapeutic effect is restricted because of its low bioavailability and severe adverse effects in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this study, we developed sorafenib-loaded silica-containing redox nanoparticles (sora@siRNP) as an oral nanomedicine to treat liver fibrosis. The designed siRNP were prepared by self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers, which possess antioxidant nitroxide radicals as a side chain of the hydrophobic segment and porous silica particles in the nanoparticle core. The silica moieties in the core formed a crosslink between the self-assembling block copolymers to afford stable drug absorption, which could be useful in harsh GI conditions after oral drug administration. Based on in vitro evaluation, sora@siRNP exerted antiproliferative and antifibrotic effects against hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and low toxicity against normal endothelial cells. A pharmacokinetic study showed that siRNP significantly improved the bioavailability and distribution of sorafenib in the liver. In an in vivo study using a mouse model of CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-induced liver fibrosis, oral administration of sora@siRNP significantly suppressed the fibrotic area in comparison to free sorafenib administration. In mice with CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-induced fibrosis, free sorafenib administration did not suppress the expression of α-smooth muscle actin; however, mice treated with sora@siRNP showed significantly suppressed expression of α-smooth muscle actin, indicating the inhibition of HSC activation, which was confirmed by in vitro experiments. Moreover, oral administration of free sorafenib induced severe intestinal damage and increased leakage into the gut, which can be attributed to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our antioxidant nanocarriers, siRNP, reduced the adverse effects of local ROS scavenging in the GI tract. Our results suggest that sora@siRNP could serve as a promising oral nanomedicine for liver fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meldonium Ameliorates Hypoxia-Induced Lung Injury and Oxidative Stress by Regulating Platelet-Type Phosphofructokinase-Mediated Glycolysis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35450040/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic environments at high altitudes influence the long-term non-altitude health of residents, by inducing changes in metabolism and the mitochondria, severe lung injury, and endangering life. This study was aimed to determine whether meldonium can ameliorate hypoxia-induced lung injury and investigate its possible molecular mechanisms. We used Swiss mice and exposed type Ⅱ alveolar epithelial cell to hypobaric hypoxic conditions to induce lung injury and found that meldonium has significant preventive effect, which was associated with the regulation of glycolysis. We found using human proteome microarrays assay, molecular docking, immunofluorescence and pull-down assay that the target protein of meldonium is a platelet-type phosphofructokinase (PFKP), which is a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. Also, meldonium promotes the transfer of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, which mitigates oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage under hypoxic condition. Mechanistically, meldonium ameliorates lung injury by targeting PFKP to regulate glycolysis, which promotes Nrf2 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to alleviate oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage under hypoxic condition. Our study provides a novel potential prevention and treatment strategy against hypoxia-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pulmonary delivery of resveratrol- β-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes for the prevention of zinc chloride smoke-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35380089/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoke bombs are often used in military/fire training, which can produce a large amount of zinc chloride (ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) smoke. Inhalation of ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; smoke usually causes acute lung injury (ALI) that would likely develop to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there is no effective prevention or treatment strategy for the smoke-induced ALI. Resveratrol (RES) is a natural polyphenol with good anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, but its low solubility, stability, and bioavailability restrict its clinical application. In this study, an inhalable RES formulation composed of RES-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes (RES-β-CD) was prepared for the prevention of ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; smoke-induced ALI. RES-β-CD powders had a small mass median aerodynamic diameter of 3.61 μm and a high fine particle fraction of 38.84%, suitable for pulmonary inhalation. RES-β-CD exhibited low BEAS-2B cytotoxicity. Pulmonary delivery of RES-β-CD to mice remarkably prevented the smoke-induced ALI with downregulation of TNF-α, IL-1β, STAT3, and GATA3, and upregulation of T-bet and Foxp3. RES-β-CD protected the respiratory function, percutaneous oxygen saturation, physical activity, lung capillary integrity, and lung liquid balance, alleviating inflammation and apoptosis. Pulmonary delivery of the positive drug, budesonide (BUD), also alleviated the smoke-induced ALI by reduction of inflammation and cell apoptosis. RES-β-CD exhibited the regulation of the Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 balances, while BUD did not show any effect on immune balances. In conclusion, pulmonary delivery of RES-β-CD is a promising anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis strategy for the prevention of ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; smoke-induced ALI by direct lung drug distribution and regulation of immune balance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; With the widespread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, in spite of the newly emerging vaccines, mutated strains remain a great obstacle to supportive and preventive measures. Coronavirus 19 survivors continue to face great danger of contacting the disease again. As long as no specific treatment has yet to be approved, a great percentage of patients experience real complications, including among others, lung fibrosis. High oxygen inhalation especially for prolonged periods is per se destructive to the lungs. Nevertheless, oxygen remains the first line support for such patients. In the present study we aimed at investigating the role of amniotic fluid-mesenchymal stem cells in preventing versus treating the hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis in rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The study was conducted on adult albino rats; 5 pregnant female rats were used as amniotic fluid donors, and 64 male rats were randomly divided into two groups: Control group; where 10 rats were kept in normal atmospheric air then sacrificed after 2 months, and hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis group, where 54 rats were exposed to hyperoxia (100% oxygen for 6 h/day) in air-tight glass chambers for 1 month, then randomly divided into the following 5 subgroups: Hyperoxia group, cell-free media-treated group, stem cells-prophylactic group, stem cells-treated group and untreated group. Isolation, culture and proliferation of stem cells were done till passage 3. Pulmonary function tests, histological examination of lung tissue under light and electron microscopes, biochemical assessment of oxidative stress, IL-6 and Rho-A levels, and statistical analysis of data were performed. F-test (ANOVA) was used for normally distributed quantitative variables, to compare between more than two groups, and Post Hoc test (Tukey) for pairwise comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Labelled amniotic fluid-mesenchymal stem cells homed to lung tissue. Stem cells administration in the stem cells-prophylactic group succeeded to maintain pulmonary functions near the normal values with no significant difference between their values and those of the control group. Moreover, histological examination of lung tissues showed that stem cells-prophylactic group were completely protected while stem cells-treated group still showed various degrees of tissue injury, namely; thickened interalveolar septa, atelectasis and interstitial pneumonia. Biochemical studies after stem cells injection also showed decreased levels of RhoA and IL-6 in the prophylactic group and to a lesser extent in the treated group, in addition to increased total antioxidant capacity and decreased malondialdehyde in the stem cells-injected groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Amniotic fluid-mesenchymal stem cells showed promising protective and therapeutic results against hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis as evaluated physiologically, histologically and biochemically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ivermectin-loaded nanoparticles were delivered to lungs through adsorption on RBCs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RBC-hitchhiking strategy improved ivermectin pharmacokinetics and bioavailability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nanoparticle properties affected the characteristics of RBC-nanoparticles &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have demonstrated that ivermectin (IVM) exhibits antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the repurposing of IVM for the treatment of COVID-19 has presented challenges primarily due to the low IVM plasma concentration after oral administration, which was well below IC50. Here, a red blood cell (RBC)-hitchhiking strategy was used for the targeted delivery of IVM-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) to the lung. IVM-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs (IVM-PNPs) and chitosan-coating IVM-PNPs (IVM-CSPNPs) were prepared and adsorbed onto RBCs. Both RBC-hitchhiked IVM-PNPs and IVM-CSPNPs could significantly enhance IVM delivery to lungs, improve IVM accumulation in lung tissue, inhibit the inflammatory responses and finally significantly alleviate the progression of acute lung injury. Specifically, the redistribution and circulation effects were related to the properties of NPs. RBC-hitchhiked cationic IVM-CSPNPs showed a longer circulation time, slower accumulation and elimination rates, and higher anti-inflammatory activities than RBC-hitchhiked anionic IVM-PNPs. Therefore, RBC-hitchhiking provides an alternative strategy to improve IVM pharmacokinetics and bioavailability for repurposing of IVM to treat COVID-19. Furthermore, according to different redistribution effects of different NPs, RBC-hitchhiked NPs may achieve various accumulation rates and circulation times for different requirements of drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silencing of long non-coding RNA ZFAS1 alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury by mediating the miR-96-5p/OXSR1 axis in sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35385711/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Extensive studies have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). This study focused on the function and potential mechanisms of lncRNA zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1) in a cell model of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To induce sepsis-induced ALI in vitro and in vivo, mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation, and human small airway epithelial cells (HSAECs) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 μg/mL). Relative expression of oxidative stress-responsive 1 (OXSR1), lncRNA ZFAS1, and microRNA (miR)-96-5p was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Relative protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and OXSR1 was determined by western blotting. Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to test the targeting interplay between ZFAS1/OXSR1 and miR-96-5p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Up-regulation of lncRNA ZFAS1 and OXSR1 and down-regulation of miR-96-5p was observed in lung tissues of CLP-induced mice and LPS-treated HSAECs. Decreased ZFAS1 expression or increased miR-96-5p expression repressed inflammation and apoptosis and promoted cell viability in LPS-treated HSAECs. The lncRNA ZFAS1 competitively binds to miR-96-5p and inversely modulates miR-96-5p expression. MiR-96-5p directly targets OXSR1 and inversely regulates OXSR1 expression. In addition, the protective effects of ZFAS1 knockdown on LPS-induced HSAECs were reversed by miR-96-5p inhibition or OXSR1 overexpression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Down-regulation of lncRNA ZFAS1 attenuated LPS-induced ALI in HSAECs by regulating the miR-96-5p/OXSR1 axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Early IL-17A production helps establish Mycobacterium intracellulare infection in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35363832/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection is common in patients with structural lung damage. To address how NTM infection is established and causes lung damage, we established an NTM mouse model by intranasal inoculation of clinical isolates of &lt;em&gt;M. intracellulare&lt;/em&gt;. During the 39-week course of infection, the bacteria persistently grew in the lung and caused progressive granulomatous and fibrotic lung damage with mortality exceeding 50%. Lung neutrophils were significantly increased at 1 week postinfection, reduced at 2 weeks postinfection and increased again at 39 weeks postinfection. IL-17A was increased in the lungs at 1-2 weeks of infection and reduced at 3 weeks postinfection. Depletion of neutrophils during early (0-2 weeks) and late (32-34 weeks) infection had no effect on mortality or lung damage in chronically infected mice. However, neutralization of IL-17A during early infection significantly reduced bacterial burden, fibrotic lung damage, and mortality in chronically infected mice. Since it is known that IL-17A regulates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and that MMPs contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, we determined the levels of MMPs in the lungs of &lt;em&gt;M. intracellulare&lt;/em&gt;-infected mice. Interestingly, MMP-3 was significantly reduced by anti-IL-17A neutralizing antibody. Moreover, in vitro data showed that exogenous IL-17A exaggerated the production of MMP-3 by lung epithelial cells upon &lt;em&gt;M. intracellulare&lt;/em&gt; infection. Collectively, our findings suggest that early IL-17A production precedes and promotes organized pulmonary &lt;em&gt;M. intracellulare&lt;/em&gt; infection in mice, at least in part through MMP-3 production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>lincRNA-Cox2 Functions to Regulate Inflammation in Alveolar Macrophages during Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35365562/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our respiratory system is vital to protect us from the surrounding nonsterile environment; therefore, it is critical for a state of homeostasis to be maintained through a balance of inflammatory cues. Recent studies have shown that actively transcribed noncoding regions of the genome are emerging as key regulators of biological processes, including inflammation. &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt; is one such example of an inflammatory inducible long intergenic noncoding RNA functioning to fine-tune immune gene expression. Using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, in addition to FACS, we find that &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt; is most highly expressed in the lung and is most upregulated after LPS-induced lung injury (acute lung injury [ALI]) within alveolar macrophages, where it functions to regulate inflammation. We previously reported that &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt; functions to regulate its neighboring protein Ptgs2 in cis, and in this study, we use genetic mouse models to confirm its role in regulating gene expression more broadly in trans during ALI. Il6, Ccl3, and Ccl5 are dysregulated in the &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice and can be rescued to wild type levels by crossing the deficient mice with our newly generated &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt; transgenic mice, confirming that this gene functions in trans. Many genes are specifically regulated by &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt; within alveolar macrophages originating from the bone marrow because the phenotype can be reversed by transplantation of wild type bone marrow into the &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice. In conclusion, we show that &lt;em&gt;lincRNA-Cox2&lt;/em&gt; is a trans-acting long noncoding RNA that functions to regulate immune responses and maintain homeostasis within the lung at baseline and on LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LPS Response Is Impaired by Urban Fine Particulate Matter</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35409273/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) is a complex mixture of components with diverse chemical and physical characteristics associated with increased respiratory and cardiovascular diseases mortality. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of exposure to concentrated PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; on LPS-induced lung injury onset. BALB/c male mice were exposed to either filtered air or ambient fine PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; in an ambient particle concentrator for 5 weeks. Then, an acute lung injury was induced with nebulized LPS. The animals were euthanized 24 h after the nebulization to either LPS or saline. Inflammatory cells and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF) were assessed in the blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung tissue. In addition, lung morphology was assessed by stereological methods. Our results showed that the PM+LPS group showed histological evidence of injury, leukocytosis with increased neutrophils and macrophages, and a mixed inflammatory response profile, with increased KC, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-4, and IL-17. Our analysis shows that there is an interaction between the LPS nebulization and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, differently modulating the inflammatory response, with a distinct response pattern as compared to LPS or PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure alone. Further studies are required to explain the mechanism of immune modulation caused by PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung Imaging Reveals Stroke-Induced Impairment in Pulmonary Intravascular Neutrophil Function, a Response Exacerbated with Aging</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35365565/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stroke patients, infection is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. Moreover, older stroke patients show an increased risk of developing stroke-associated infection, although the mechanisms underlying this increased susceptibility to infection are unknown. In this study, using an experimental mouse model of ischemic stroke, we showed that older (12-15 mo of age) mice had elevated lung bacterial infection and inflammatory damage after stroke when compared with young (8-10 wk of age) counterparts, despite undergoing the same degree of brain injury. Intravital microscopy of the lung microvasculature revealed that in younger mice, stroke promoted neutrophil arrest in pulmonary microvessels, but this response was not seen in older poststroke mice. In addition, bacterial phagocytosis by neutrophils in the lung microvasculature was reduced by both aging and stroke, such that neutrophils in aged poststroke mice showed the greatest impairment in this function. Analysis of neutrophil migration in vitro and in the cremaster muscle demonstrated that stroke alone did not negatively impact neutrophil migration, but that the combination of increased age and stroke led to reduced effectiveness of neutrophil chemotaxis. Transcriptomic analysis of pulmonary neutrophils using RNA sequencing identified 79 genes that were selectively altered in the context of combined aging and stroke, and they were associated with pathways that control neutrophil chemotaxis. Taken together, the findings of this study show that stroke in older animals results in worsening of neutrophil antibacterial responses and changes in neutrophil gene expression that have the potential to underpin elevated risk of stroke-associated infection in the context of increased age.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neurologic Prognostication After Cardiac Arrest Using Brain Biomarkers: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35226054/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Importance:&lt;/em&gt; Brain injury biomarkers released into circulation from the injured neurovascular unit are important prognostic tools in patients with cardiac arrest who develop hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HIBI) after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To assess the neuroprognostic utility of bloodborne brain injury biomarkers in patients with cardiac arrest with HIBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data sources:&lt;/em&gt; Studies in electronic databases from inception to September 15, 2021. These databases included MEDLINE, Embase, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the World Health Organization Global Health Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study selection:&lt;/em&gt; Articles included in this systmatic review and meta-analysis were independently assessed by 2 reviewers. We included studies that investigated neuron-specific enolase, S100 calcium-binding protein β, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light, tau, or ubiquitin carboxyl hydrolase L1 in patients with cardiac arrest aged 18 years and older for neurologic prognostication. We excluded studies that did not (1) dichotomize neurologic outcome as favorable vs unfavorable, (2) specify the timing of blood sampling or outcome determination, or (3) report diagnostic test accuracy or biomarker concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data extraction and synthesis:&lt;/em&gt; Data on the study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, brain biomarkers levels, diagnostic test accuracy, and neurologic outcome were recorded. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main outcomes and measures:&lt;/em&gt; Summary receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to calculate the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and optimal thresholds for each biomarker. Risk of bias and concerns of applicability were assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We identified 2953 studies, of which 86 studies with 10 567 patients (7777 men [73.6] and 2790 women [26.4]; pooled mean [SD] age, 62.8 [10.2] years) were included. Biomarker analysis at 48 hours after ROSC demonstrated that neurofilament light had the highest predictive value for unfavorable neurologic outcome, with an area under the curve of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.84-0.97). Subgroup analyses of patients treated with targeted temperature management and those who specifically had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest showed similar results (targeted temperature management, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.86-0.95] and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86-0.97]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions and relevance:&lt;/em&gt; Neurofilament light, which reflects white matter damage and axonal injury, yielded the highest accuracy in predicting neurologic outcome in patients with HIBI at 48 hours after ROSC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pro-Resolving Mediator Resolvin E1 Restores Alveolar Fluid Clearance in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35271545/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier and impaired alveolar fluid clearance. Resolvin E1 (RvE1) is a specialized pro-resolving mediator derived endogenously from omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids. RvE1 (10 μg/kg i.v.) was injected to rats 6 h post-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (14 mg/kg) induction. After another 3 h, alveolar fluid clearance was measured in live rats (n = 8-9). The primary Type II alveolar epithelial cell was isolated and treated by LPS (1 μg/mL) with or without RvE1 (250 nM). The expression of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase (NKA), AKT, serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1), and Nedd4-2 were detected. RvE1 improved survival rate (30% vs. 70%, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.048), increased the clearance of alveolar fluid (13.34% vs. 18.73%, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), reduced lung wet-dry weight ratio (5.01 vs. 4.63, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), mitigated lung injury scores (13.38 vs. 7.0, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and inflammation in LPS-induced ARDS in rats. RvE1 upregulated alveolar ENaC and NKA expression &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, RvE1 significantly increased the expression of phosphorylated AKT, SGK1, and phosphorylated Nedd4-2 in LPS-stimulated primary alveolar type II cells. The effects of RvE1 were abrogated by blocking phosphatidylinositide3&amp;rsquo;-kinase (PI3K) and SGK1 with LY294002 and GSK650394, respectively. In summary, RvE1 upregulated ENaC and NKA expression by activating PI3K/AKT/SGK1 pathway to promote alveolar fluid clearance, suggesting that RvE1 may be a potentially effective drug for ARDS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A strategy for attenuation of acute radiation-induced lung injury using crocetin from gardenia fruit</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35366531/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crocetin effectively alleviates acute radiation-induced lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tnfrsf10b&lt;/em&gt; gene-mediated necroptosis is involved in radiation-induced lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crocetin inhibits necroptosis through &lt;em&gt;Tnfrsf10b&lt;/em&gt; gene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced lung injury limits the implementation of radiotherapy plans and severely impairs the quality of life. Crocetin has the capability to protect against radiation. This study is aimed at estimate the preventive effect and mechanism of crocetin on acute radiation induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and materials:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we offer a strategy for radiation-induced lung injury by using crocetin, an extract of gardenia fruit. Histopathology, transcriptomics, flow cytometry, and other methods have served to examine the effect and mechanism of crocetin on acute radiation-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Crocetin effectively alleviates radiation-induced alveolar wall thickening and alveolar destruction. The number of normal alveoli and lung structure of mice is well protected by the prevention of crocetin. It is found that crocetin inhibits necroptosis to achieve effective radioprotection by down regulating the &lt;em&gt;Tnfrsf10b&lt;/em&gt; gene in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Crocetin inhibits necroptosis through transcriptional regulation of the &lt;em&gt;Tnfrsf10b&lt;/em&gt; gene, thereby preventing radiation-induced lung injury. This work may provide a new strategy for the prevention of lung radiation injury by the extract from Chinese herbal medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lung injury and inflammation occurred after SD rats were treated with 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/200 μL 100 nm PS-MPs for 14 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gene sequencing detected a series of altered lncRNA and circRNA after treatment of 100 nm PS-MPs in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LncRNA XLOC_031479, lncRNA XLOC_014188, circRNA 014924, circRNA 006,603 and circ 003,982 may be potential targets for lung damage caused by PS-MPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microplastics (MPs) pollution has become a global concern due to its close relation to the environment and human health. Recently, more and more studies have pointed out the existence of MPs in the air, but its potential inhalation toxicity is unclear. Polystyrene Microplastics (PS-MPs) is one of the representative MPs. Besides, non-coding RNA plays crucial roles in regulating gene expression. Therefore, this study aims to provide new insights into the molecular exploration of PS-MPs inhalation. In this study, Sprague Dawley（SD）rats were treated with 100 nm, 500 nm, 1 μm and 2.5 μm PS-MPs for three days. And then intra-tracheal instillation of saline or 100 nm PS-MPs with 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/200 μL were performed in SD rats every two days for two consecutive weeks. The deposition of PS-MPs was observed through immunofluorescence. Lung histological alternations were observed in haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining sections. The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines were quantified by ELISA and qPCR. Genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs) in rats lung were done by ribosomal RNA depleted RNA sequencing and verified by qRT-PCR. We observed that 100 nm and 1 μm PS-MPs could deposite in the lungs. In addition, pathological examination shows alveolar destruction and bronchial epithelium arranged in a mess in PS-MPs groups. Furthermore, the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β were upregulated in PS-MPs exposed rats. Sequencing results showed that 269 circRNAs and 109 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in lung tissue of the saline and PS-MPs exposed rats. The upregulated expressions of lncRNA XLOC_031479, circRNA 014924 and circRNA 006603 and the downregulated expressions of lncRNA XLOC_014188 and circ003982 were identified by qRT-PCR in MPs group. The identified novel circRNAs and lncRNAs may paly important role in the development of lung inflammation caused by PS-MPs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NEDD4 attenuates phosgene-induced acute lung injury through the inhibition of Notch1 activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35355403/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosgene gas leakage can cause life-threatening acute lung injury (ALI), which is characterized by inflammation, increased vascular permeability, pulmonary oedema and oxidative stress. Although the downregulation of neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (NEDD4) is known to be associated with inflammation and oxidative damage, its functions in phosgene-induced ALI remain unclear. In this study, rats with phosgene-induced ALI were intravenously injected with NEDD4-overexpressing lentiviruses to determine the functions of NEDD4 in this inflammatory condition. NEDD4 expression was decreased in the lung parenchyma of phosgene-exposed control rats, whereas its expression level was high in the NEDD4-overexpressing rats. Phosgene exposure increased the wet-to-dry lung weight ratio, but NEDD4 abrogated this effect. NEDD4 overexpression attenuated phosgene-induced lung inflammation, lowering the high lung injury score (based on total protein, inflammatory cells and inflammatory factors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) and also reduced phosgene-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. Finally, NEDD4 was found to interact with Notch1, enhancing its ubiquitination and thereby its degradation, thus attenuating the inflammatory responses to ALI. Therefore, we demonstrated that NEDD4 plays a protective role in alleviating phosgene-induced ALI, suggesting that enhancing the effect of NEDD4 may be a new approach for treating phosgene-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inflammatory blockade prevents injury to the developing pulmonary gas exchange surface in preterm primates</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35353543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perinatal inflammatory stress is associated with early life morbidity and lifelong consequences for pulmonary health. Chorioamnionitis, an inflammatory condition affecting the placenta and fluid surrounding the developing fetus, affects 25 to 40% of preterm births. Severe chorioamnionitis with preterm birth is associated with significantly increased risk of pulmonary disease and secondary infections in childhood, suggesting that fetal inflammation may markedly alter the development of the lung. Here, we used intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge to induce experimental chorioamnionitis in a prenatal rhesus macaque (&lt;em&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/em&gt;) model that mirrors structural and temporal aspects of human lung development. Inflammatory injury directly disrupted the developing gas exchange surface of the primate lung, with extensive damage to alveolar structure, particularly the close association and coordinated differentiation of alveolar type 1 pneumocytes and specialized alveolar capillary endothelium. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis defined a multicellular alveolar signaling niche driving alveologenesis that was extensively disrupted by perinatal inflammation, leading to a loss of gas exchange surface and alveolar simplification, with notable resemblance to chronic lung disease in newborns. Blockade of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α ameliorated LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury by blunting stromal responses to inflammation and modulating innate immune activation in myeloid cells, restoring structural integrity and key signaling networks in the developing alveolus. These data provide new insight into the pathophysiology of developmental lung injury and suggest that modulating inflammation is a promising therapeutic approach to prevent fetal consequences of chorioamnionitis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acute Kidney Injury Interacts With Coma, Acidosis, and Impaired Perfusion to Significantly Increase Risk of Death in Children With Severe Malaria</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35349633/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Mortality in severe malaria remains high in children treated with intravenous artesunate. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of severe malaria, but the interactions between AKI and other complications on the risk of mortality in severe malaria are not well characterized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Between 2014 and 2017, 600 children aged 6-48 months to 4 years hospitalized with severe malaria were enrolled in a prospective clinical cohort study evaluating clinical predictors of mortality in children with severe malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The mean age of children in this cohort was 2.1 years (standard deviation, 0.9 years) and 338 children (56.3%) were male. Mortality was 7.3%, and 52.3% of deaths occurred within 12 hours of admission. Coma, acidosis, impaired perfusion, AKI, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and hyperkalemia were associated with increased mortality (all &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001). AKI interacted with each risk factor to increase mortality (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001 for interaction). Children with clinical indications for dialysis (14.4% of all children) had an increased risk of death compared with those with no indications for dialysis (odds ratio, 6.56; 95% confidence interval, 3.41-12.59).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; AKI interacts with coma, acidosis, or impaired perfusion to significantly increase the risk of death in severe malaria. Among children with AKI, those who have hyperkalemia or elevated BUN have a higher risk of death. A better understanding of the causes of these complications of severe malaria, and development and implementation of measures to prevent and treat them, such as dialysis, are needed to reduce mortality in severe malaria.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chromatin-associated orphan snoRNA regulates DNA damage-mediated differentiation via a non-canonical complex</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35354054/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A subset of orphan chromatin-associated snoRNAs (casnoRNAs) is identified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SNORA73 deregulation impacts genome stability and maintains differentiation block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 5′ non-canonical structure is critical for SNORA73 function and PARP1 binding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SNORA73 assembles a non-canonical snoRNP to inhibit PARP1 PARylation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are commonly acknowledged as a class of homogeneous non-coding RNAs that guide ribosomal RNA modifications. However, snoRNAs referred to as orphans have largely unknown functions. Here, we systematically profile chromatin-associated snoRNAs (casnoRNAs) in mammalian cells and identify a subgroup of orphan casnoRNAs responding to DNA damage stress, among which SNORA73 shows the most marked reduction in chromatin enrichment. Downregulated SNORA73 maintains cancer genome stability and differentiation block in hematopoietic malignancy. Mechanistically, casnoRNA the 5&amp;rsquo; end non-canonical structure of SNORA73 is critical for its function and binding to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). SNORA73 inhibits PARP1 auto-PARylation to affect cancer genome stability by forming a small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) with PARP1 and canonical H/ACA proteins DKC1/NHP2. Our findings reveal the role of an orphan snoRNA serving as casnoRNA and highlights a link between non-canonical structure of snoRNA and their functional diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of bromodomain extraterminal histone readers alleviates skin fibrosis in experimental models of scleroderma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35349485/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binding of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain proteins (BETs) to acetylated histone residues is critical for gene transcription. We sought to determine the antifibrotic efficacy and potential mechanisms of BET inhibition in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Blockade of BETs was done using a pan-BET inhibitor, JQ1; BRD2 inhibitor, BIC1; or BRD4 inhibitors AZD5153 or ARV825. BET inhibition, specifically BRD4 blockade, showed antifibrotic effects in an animal model of SSc and in patient-derived diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) fibroblasts. Transcriptome analysis of JQ1-treated dcSSc fibroblasts revealed differentially expressed genes related to extracellular matrix, cell cycle, and calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) signaling. The antifibrotic effect of BRD4 inhibition was mediated at least in part by downregulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α and reduction of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations. On the basis of these results, we propose targeting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; pathways or BRD4 as potentially novel therapeutic approaches for progressive tissue fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A nitric oxide-eluting and REDV peptide-conjugated coating promotes vascular healing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35366606/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug-eluting stents (DESs) placement remarkably reduces the over-proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and thus neointimal hyperplasia. However, the pharmacological agent also slows down the re-endothelization, delays injury vascular healing and increases the risk of in-stent restenosis (ISR). Here, inspired by mussel foot proteins (Mfps), a mimicking endothelium functional stent coating was efficiently fabricated by thiol-ene &amp;ldquo;click&amp;rdquo; reaction, consisting of catechol grafted chitosan (CS-C), zinc sulfate, and Arg-Glu-Asp-Val (REDV) peptide. The mimicking endothelium coating could continuously catalyze endogenous nitric oxide (NO) gas and maintain the bioactivity of REDV peptide. Compared with bare stents, the mimicking coatings significantly inhibited the acute thrombosis for the first 1-week, accelerated re-endothelization and decreased in-stent restenosis for 1- and 3-month after implantation. In addition, the synergistic effect of NO and REDV peptide also regulated inflammation response and promoted the expression of muscle fiber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TnBP and TBOEP caused pulmonary damages by inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fkbp5&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Nos3&lt;/em&gt;/MAPK/NF-κB signal pathway was upregulated when exposing to TnBP and TBOEP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TnBP aggravated OVA induced asthmatic inflammatory response with overexpression of IgE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TnBP facilitated OVA-induced asthma by upregulating PI3K/Akt/NF-кB signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkyl organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), are ubiquitously detected in indoor and outdoor environments and their inhalation may result in lung damage. This study examined pulmonary toxicity after exposure to TnBP or TBOEP and investigated aggravation of inflammation and immunoreaction by TnBP in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mice model. Transcriptomics were used to further reveal the underlying mechanism. Exposure to TnBP or TBOEP resulted in pathological damage, including edema and thickened alveolar septum. In comparison with the control, enhanced levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01 in TnBP (High) group and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 in TBOEP (High) group), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), malondialdehyde (MDA) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), and cytokines under a dose-dependent relationship were noted, and the expression of the Fkbp5/Nos3/MAPK/NF-кB signaling pathway (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) was upregulated in the TnBP and TBOEP groups. Moreover, the combined exposure of TnBP and OVA exacerbated the allergic inflammatory response, including airway hyperresponsiveness, leukocytosis, cellular exudation and infiltration, secretion of inflammatory mediators, and higher expression of IgE (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Transcriptomics results demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt/NF-кB signal pathway was involved in TnBP-aggravated asthmatic mice. Exposure to TnBP or TBOEP resulted in oxidative damage and leukocyte-induced lung injury. TnBP can further facilitate OVA-induced asthma through an inflammatory response. This study is the first to reveal the pulmonary toxicity and potential mechanism induced by OPFRs through an in-vivo model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beneficial effects of aloperine on inflammation and oxidative stress by suppressing necroptosis in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury mouse model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35397283/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Alveolar epithelial cell death, inflammation, and oxidative stress are typical features of acute lung injury (ALI). Aloperine (Alo), an alkaloid isolated from Sophora alopecuroides, has been reported to display various biological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and anti-oxidant properties. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of Alo in treating a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in a murine model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The effects of Alo in LPS-induced ALI were investigated in C57BL/6 mice. The RIPK1 inhibitor (Nec-1) and the RIPK3 inhibitor (GSK&#39;872) were used to evaluate the relationship of necroptosis, NF-κB activation, and PDC subunits in LPS-treated mouse alveolar epithelial cells (MLE-12). Then the effects of Alo on necroptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress of LPS-stimulated MLE-12 cells were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Alo significantly attenuated histopathological lung injuries and reduced lung wet/dry ratio in LPS-induced ALI mice. Alo also remarkedly reduced total protein and neutrophils recruitment in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of ALI mice. Meanwhile, Alo ameliorated the LPS-induced necroptosis in the lungs of ALI mice. The RIPK3 inhibitor GSK&#39;872, but not the RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1, reversed LPS-induced p65 phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus in MLE-12 cells. GSK&#39;872 also reversed the LPS-induced increase in ROS and binding of RIPK3 and PDC subunits in MLE-12 cells. Moreover, Alo down-regulated the levels of p-RIPK1, p-RIPK3, p-MLKL, p-p65, the translocation of p65 to the nucleus, and reduced the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in LPS-stimulated MLE-12 cells. Alo also inhibited the binding of RIPK3 and PDC-E1α, PDC-E1β, PDC-E2, and PDC-E3 and the ROS production in LPS-treated MLE-12 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The present study validated the beneficial effects of Alo on LPS-induced ALI , suggesting Alo may be a new drug candidate against ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modeling chronic Cd induced nephrotoxicity in normal and diabetic conditions in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanisms underlying Cd induced renal injury revealed via transcriptome profiling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gene signature predictive of the susceptibility to Cd nephrotoxicity by deep learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiology studies have indicated that environmental cadmium exposure, even at low levels, will result in chronic cadmium accumulation in the kidney with profound adverse consequences and that the diabetic population is more susceptible. However, the underlying mechanisms are yet not fully understood. In the present study, we applied an animal model to study chronic cadmium exposure-induced renal injury and performed whole transcriptome profiling studies. Repetitive CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposure resulted in cadmium accumulation and remarkable renal injuries in the animals. The diabetic ob/ob mice manifested increased severity of renal injury compared with the wild type C57BL/6 J littermate controls. RNA-Seq data showed that cadmium treatment induced dramatic gene expression changes in a dose-dependent manner. Among the differentially expressed genes include the apoptosis hallmark genes which significantly demarcated the treatment effects. Pathway enrichment and network analyses revealed biological oxidation (mainly glucuronidation) as one of the major stress responses induced by cadmium treatment. We next implemented a deep learning algorithm in conjunction with cloud computing and discovered a gene signature that can predict the degree of renal injury induced by cadmium treatment. The present study provided, for the first time, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of chronic cadmium-induced nephrotoxicity in normal and diabetic populations at the whole genome level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>lncRNA MEG3 restrained the M1 polarization of microglia in acute spinal cord injury through the HuR/A20/NF-κB axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35338543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammation restrict the treatment of acute spinal cord injury (ASCI), and long non-coding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) expression is lessened in ASCI. However, the function and mechanism of lncRNA MEG3 in the M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammation in ASCI are unclear. The expressions of lncRNA MEG3 in ASCI mouse spinal cord tissues and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated primary microglia and BV2 cells were quantified through a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. In-vitro assays were conducted to explore the function of lncRNA MEG3 in the M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammation in ASCI. RNA degradation, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, cycloheximide-chase, and ubiquitination analyses were carried out to probe into the mechanism of lncRNA MEG3 in the M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammation in ASCI. The lncRNA MEG3 expression was lessened in the ASCI mouse spinal cord tissues and LPS-treated primary microglia and BV2 cells, and the overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 restrained the M1 polarization of microglia and the neuroinflammation by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. For the investigation of the potential mechanism of such, the overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 restrained the M1 polarization of microglia through the HuR/A20/NF-κB axis and boosted the motor function recovery and neuroinflammation relief in the mice with SCI. The overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 restrained the M1 polarization of microglia through the HuR/A20/NF-κB axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanisms and clinical implications of endothelium-dependent vasomotor dysfunction in coronary microvasculature</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35333122/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronary microvascular disease (CMD), which affects the arterioles and capillary endothelium that regulate myocardial perfusion, is an increasingly recognized source of morbidity and mortality, particularly in the setting of metabolic syndrome. The coronary endothelium plays a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis, though factors such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity can contribute to endothelial injury and consequently arteriolar vasomotor dysfunction. These disturbances in the coronary microvasculature clinically manifest as diminished coronary flow reserve, which is a known independent risk factor for cardiac death, even in the absence of macrovascular atherosclerotic disease. Therefore, a growing body of literature has examined the molecular mechanisms by which coronary microvascular injury occurs at the level of the endothelium and the consequences on arteriolar vasomotor responses. This review will begin with an overview of normal coronary microvascular physiology, modalities of measuring coronary microvascular function, and clinical implications of CMD. These introductory topics will be followed by a discussion of recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms by which inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, shear stress, endothelial cell senescence, and tissue ischemia dysregulate coronary endothelial homeostasis and arteriolar vasomotor function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STING agonist diABZI induces PANoptosis and DNA mediated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35338116/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) contributes to immune responses against tumors and may control viral infection including SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, activation of the STING pathway by airway silica or smoke exposure leads to cell death, self-dsDNA release, and STING/type I IFN dependent acute lung inflammation/ARDS. The inflammatory response induced by a synthetic non-nucleotide-based diABZI STING agonist, in comparison to the natural cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, is unknown. A low dose of diABZI (1 µg by endotracheal route for 3 consecutive days) triggered an acute neutrophilic inflammation, disruption of the respiratory barrier, DNA release with NET formation, PANoptosis cell death, and inflammatory cytokines with type I IFN dependent acute lung inflammation. Downstream upregulation of DNA sensors including cGAS, DDX41, IFI204, as well as NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, suggested a secondary inflammatory response to dsDNA as a danger signal. DNase I treatment, inhibition of NET formation together with an investigation in gene-deficient mice highlighted extracellular DNA and TLR9, but not cGAS, as central to diABZI-induced neutrophilic response. Therefore, activation of acute cell death with DNA release may lead to ARDS which may be modeled by diABZI. These results show that airway targeting by STING activator as a therapeutic strategy for infection may enhance lung inflammation with severe ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TAK1 is essential for endothelial barrier maintenance and repair after lung vascular injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35324316/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) plays crucial roles in innate and adaptive immune responses and is required for embryonic vascular development. However, TAK1&amp;rsquo;s role in regulating vascular barrier integrity is not well defined. Here we show that endothelial TAK1 kinase function is required to maintain and repair the injured lung endothelial barrier. We observed that inhibition of TAK1 with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol markedly reduced expression of β-catenin (β-cat) and VE-cadherin at endothelial adherens junctions and augmented protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1)- or toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)-induced increases in lung vascular permeability. In inducible endothelial cell (EC)-restricted TAK1 knockout (&lt;em&gt;TAK1&lt;sup&gt;i∆EC&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice, we observed that the lung endothelial barrier was compromised and in addition, &lt;em&gt;TAK1&lt;sup&gt;i∆EC&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice exhibited heightened sensitivity to septic shock. Consistent with these findings, we observed dramatically reduced β-cat expression in lung ECs of &lt;em&gt;TAK1&lt;sup&gt;i∆EC&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Further, either inhibition or knockdown of TAK1 blocked PAR-1- or TLR-4-induced inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which in turn increased phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and degradation of β-cat in ECs to destabilize the endothelial barrier. Importantly, we showed that TAK1 inactivates GSK3β through AKT activation in ECs. Thus our findings in this study point to the potential of targeting the TAK1-AKT-GSK3β axis as a therapeutic approach to treat uncontrolled lung vascular leak during sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TNF-α stimulation enhances the neuroprotective effects of gingival MSCs derived exosomes in retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury via the MEG3/miR-21a-5p axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35378413/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the main pathogenic mechanisms of glaucoma, which are largely unknown, including neuroinflammation and neuronal death in the pathological process. In our previous studies, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to play anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective roles. Additionally, conditioned culture medium (CM) of MSCs stimulated by TNF-α have achieved better antiallergic effects in an experimental allergic conjunctivitis mouse model. However, there is an urgent need for cell-free therapy approaches, like exosomes, to reduce the side effects of autoimmunity. The present study aimed to elucidate the pathways involving TNF-α-stimulated gingival MSC (GMSC)-exosomes (TG-exos), in modulating inflammatory microglia and alleviating apoptosis. In this study, exosomes from the CM of GMSCs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and were injected into the vitreous of mice. The results showed that intraocular injection of TG-exos into mice with IRI notably reduced inflammation and cell loss than that with G-exos (GMSC-exosomes). Similar results were observed in vitro. Additionally, with the microRNA (miR) arrays, it was found that miR-21-5p acted as a crucial factor in TG-exos for neuroprotection and anti-inflammation. Following target prediction and dual-luciferase assay suggested that miR-21-5p played a role by combining with programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), which was regulated by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). This study demonstrates a new therapeutic pathway for neuroprotection against IRI by delivering miR-21-5p-enriched exosomes through MEG3/miR-21-5p/PDCD4 axis and paves the way for the establishment of a cell-free therapeutic approach for glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Avian influenza viruses suppress innate immunity by inducing trans-transcriptional readthrough via SSU72</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35332300/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate immunity plays critical antiviral roles. The highly virulent avian influenza viruses (AIVs) H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6 can better escape host innate immune responses than the less virulent seasonal H1N1 virus. Here, we report a mechanism by which transcriptional readthrough (TRT)-mediated suppression of innate immunity occurs post AIV infection. By using cell lines, mouse lungs, and patient PBMCs, we showed that genes on the complementary strand (&amp;ldquo;trans&amp;rdquo; genes) influenced by TRT were involved in the disruption of host antiviral responses during AIV infection. The trans-TRT enhanced viral lethality, and TRT abolishment increased cell viability and STAT1/2 expression. The viral NS1 protein directly bound to SSU72, and degradation of SSU72 induced TRT. SSU72 overexpression reduced TRT and alleviated mouse lung injury. Our results suggest that AIVs infection induce TRT by reducing SSU72 expression, thereby impairing host immune responses, a molecular mechanism acting through the NS1-SSU72-trans-TRT-STAT1/2 axis. Thus, restoration of SSU72 expression might be a potential strategy for preventing AIV pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) not only increases the risk of metabolic syndrome but also initiates kidney injury. Lipid accumulation-induced systemic low-grade inflammation is an upstream mechanism of kidney injury associated with prediabetes. Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) provides potent anti-obesity effects through several mechanisms including fecal lipid excretion. In this study, we investigated the effects of COS on the prevention of obesity-related complications and its ability to confer renoprotection in a prediabetic model. Rats fed on a HFD developed obesity, glucose intolerance and kidney dysfunction. COS intervention successfully ameliorated these conditions (p &amp;lt; 0.05) by attenuating intestinal lipid absorption and the renal inflammation-autophagy-apoptosis axis. A novel anti-inflammatory effect of COS had been demonstrated by the strengthening of intestinal barrier integrity via calcium-sensing receptor (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The use of COS as a supplement may be useful in reducing prediabetic complications especially renal injury and the risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GL attenuated inflammatory lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GL reduced the NETs formation in lung tissues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GL inhibited the HMGB1 / TLR9 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GL improved lung function in mice with sepsis-induced ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are involved in the development of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Glycyrrhizin (GL), the main active ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicine Glycyrrhiza glabra, has anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and immunomodulatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; The study aims to explore the efficacy and potential mechanism of GL on sepsis-induced ARDS in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mice were randomly divided into 3 groups: Control, CLP, and GL + CLP. Mice sepsis ARDS model was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) followed by intraperitoneal GL treatment. Then, the 7-day survival rate of mice was recorded. The lung function of mice was determined by whole-body plethysmography. Lung pathology and scores were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The wet/dry ratio (W/D) of the lung was measured by weighing method. The protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was measured by the BCA method. NETs formation in lung tissue was detected by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, HMGB1、TLR9、MyD88 and IL6 expression in lung tissue were detected by western blot and by quantitative real-time PCR, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that GL improved the survival rate, attenuated lung tissue injury and reduced the expression of inflammatory factors in mice with CLP-induced sepsis. Meanwhile, we confirmed that GL could inhibit TLR9 / MyD88 activation from reducing NETs formation by decreasing HMGB1 expression. The formation of NETs is regulated by HMGB1/TLR9/MyD88. In addition, GL improved lung function in mice with sepsis-induced ARDS. Lung function suggested that GL increased alveolar ventilation, alleviated ventilator fatigue and reduced airway resistance in mice with ARDS induced by sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; GL ameliorated sepsis-induced ARDS and reduced the NETs formation in lung tissues, which may be associated with the inhibition of the HMGB1/TLR9 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loss of CLDN5 in podocytes deregulates WIF1 to activate WNT signaling and contributes to kidney disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35332151/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although mature podocytes lack tight junctions, tight junction integral membrane protein claudin-5 (CLDN5) is predominantly expressed on plasma membranes of podocytes under normal conditions. Using podocyte-specific Cldn5 knockout mice, we identify CLDN5 as a crucial regulator of podocyte function and reveal that Cldn5 deletion exacerbates podocyte injury and proteinuria in a diabetic nephropathy mouse model. Mechanistically, CLDN5 deletion reduces ZO1 expression and induces nuclear translocation of ZONAB, followed by transcriptional downregulation of WNT inhibitory factor-1 (WIF1) expression, which leads to activation of WNT signaling pathway. Podocyte-derived WIF1 also plays paracrine roles in tubular epithelial cells, as evidenced by the finding that animals with podocyte-specific deletion of Cldn5 or Wif1 have worse kidney fibrosis after unilateral ureteral obstruction than littermate controls. Systemic delivery of WIF1 suppresses the progression of diabetic nephropathy and ureteral obstruction-induced renal fibrosis. These findings establish a function for podocyte CLDN5 in restricting WNT signaling in kidney.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Association of SGLT2 inhibitors with cardiovascular, kidney, and safety outcomes among patients with diabetic kidney disease: a meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35321742/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the cardiovascular, kidney, and safety outcomes of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) among patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We searched electronic databases for major randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials published up to September 30, 2021 and reporting on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes of SGLT2i in patients with DKD. DKD was defined as chronic kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to estimate pooled hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for clinical outcomes including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, and cardiovascular death), kidney composite outcomes (a combination of worsening kidney function, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes), hospitalizations for heart failure (HHF), deaths and safety events (mycotic infections, diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA], volume depletion, amputations, fractures, urinary tract infections [UTI], acute kidney injury [AKI], and hyperkalemia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 26,106 participants with DKD from 8 large-scale trials were included (median age: 65.2 years, 29.7-41.8% women, 53.2-93.2% White, median follow-up: 2.5 years). SGLT2i were associated with reduced risks of MACE (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.93), kidney composite outcomes (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.58-0.75), HHF (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.55-0.71), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96), MI (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.92), stroke (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.97), and all-cause death (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.96), with no significant heterogeneity detected. Similar results were observed among participants with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR: &amp;lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The relative risks (95% CI) for adverse events were 3.89 (1.42-10.62) and 2.50 (1.32-4.72) for mycotic infections in men and women respectively, 3.54 (0.82-15.39) for DKA, and 1.29 (1.13-1.48) for volume depletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Among adults with DKD, SGLT2i were associated with reduced risks of MACE, kidney outcomes, HHF, and death. With a few exceptions of more clear safety signals, we found overall limited data on the associations between SGLT2i and safety outcomes. More research is needed on the safety profile of SGLT2i in this population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Growth differentiation factor-15 preserves Klotho expression in acute kidney injury and kidney fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35337892/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35337892/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF15) is a member of the GDF subfamily with potential kidney protective functions. Here, we explored the impact of GDF15 on the expression of the kidney protective factor Klotho in models of acute kidney injury and kidney fibrosis in mice. GDF15 was the most upregulated GDF family gene in experimental toxic acute kidney injury and in kidney fibrosis transcriptomics. GDF15 function was explored in toxic acute kidney injury in genetically modified mice and following treatment with GDF15. &lt;em&gt;Gdf15&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice developed more severe toxic acute kidney injury (folic acid or cisplatin) while GDF15 overexpression or GDF15 administration were protective. Kidney expression of Klotho was more severely depressed in &lt;em&gt;Gdf15&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice and was preserved by GDF15 overexpression or GDF15 treatment. Moreover, increased plasma calcitriol levels inversely correlated with kidney Klotho across models with diverse levels of GDF15 availability. Kidney fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction was more severe in &lt;em&gt;Gdf15&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice while GDF15 overexpression decreased kidney injury and preserved Klotho expression. GDF15 increased Klotho expression in vivo in healthy mice, in cultured tubular cells, and prevented Klotho downregulation by inflammatory factors in tubular cells by preventing transcription factor NF-ĸB activation. Thus, spontaneous increased kidney expression of endogenous GDF15 is not enough to prevent kidney injury, but further increments in GDF15 are kidney protecting and preserve expression of the kidney protective factor Klotho within the kidney in acute and chronic settings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of lung microbiota-derived proapoptotic peptides ameliorates acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an incurable disease of unknown etiology. Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is associated with high mortality. Excessive apoptosis of lung epithelial cells occurs in pulmonary fibrosis acute exacerbation. We recently identified corisin, a proapoptotic peptide that triggers acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we provide insights into the mechanism underlying the processing and release of corisin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an anticorisin monoclonal antibody ameliorates lung fibrosis by significantly inhibiting acute exacerbation in the human transforming growth factorβ1 model and acute lung injury in the bleomycin model. By investigating the impact of the anticorisin monoclonal antibody in a general model of acute lung injury, we further unravel the potential of corisin to impact such diseases. These results underscore the role of corisin in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis and acute lung injury and provide a novel approach to treating this incurable disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Adult progenitor cells presumably demonstrate clonogenicity, self-renewal, and multipotentiality, and can regenerate cells under various conditions. Definitive evidence demonstrating the existence of such progenitor cells in adult mammalian kidneys is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Method:&lt;/em&gt; We performed in vivo lineage tracing and thymidine analogue labeling using adult tamoxifen-inducible (&lt;em&gt;Aqp2&lt;sup&gt;ECE/+&lt;/sup&gt;RFP/+&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Aqp2&lt;sup&gt;ECE/+&lt;/sup&gt;Brainbow/+&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Aqp2&lt;sup&gt;ECE/+&lt;/sup&gt;Brainbow/Brainbow&lt;/em&gt;) and WT mice. The tamoxifen-inducible mice were analyzed between 1 and 300 days postinduction. Alternatively, WT and tamoxifen-induced mice were subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction and thymidine analogue labeling and analyzed 2-14 days post-surgery. Multiple cell-specific markers were used for high-resolution immunofluorescence confocal microscopy to identify the cell types derived from Aqp2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Like their embryonic counterparts, adult cells expressing Aqp2 and V-ATPase subunits B1 and B2 (Aqp2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;B1B2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are the potential Aqp2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; progenitor cells (APs). Adult APs rarely divide to generate daughter cells, either maintaining the property of the AP (self-renewal) or differentiating into DCT2/CNT/CD cells (multipotentiality), forming single cell-derived, multiple-cell clones (clonogenicity) during tissue maintenance. APs selectively and continuously regenerate DCT2/CNT/CD cells in response to injury resulting from ureteral ligation. AP proliferation demonstrated direct correlation with Notch activation and was inversely correlated with development of kidney fibrosis. Derivation of both intercalated and DCT2 cells was found to be cell division-dependent and -independent, most likely through AP differentiation which requires cell division and through direct conversion of APs and/or regular principal cells without cell division, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study demonstrates that Aqp2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;B1B2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells behave as adult APs to maintain and repair DCT2/CNT1/CNT2/CD segments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common clinical problem, leading to significant morbidity and mortality, and no effective pharmacotherapy exists. The problem of ARDS causing mortality became more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Biotherapeutic products containing multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell (MMSC) secretome may provide a new therapeutic paradigm for human healthcare due to their immunomodulating and regenerative abilities. The content and regenerative capacity of the secretome depends on cell origin and type of cultivation (two- or three-dimensional (2D/3D)). In this study, we investigated the proteomic profile of the secretome from 2D- and 3D-cultured placental MMSC and lung fibroblasts (LFBs) and the effect of inhalation of freeze-dried secretome on survival, lung inflammation, lung tissue regeneration, fibrin deposition in a lethal ALI model in mice. We found that three inhaled administrations of freeze-dried secretome from 2D- and 3D-cultured placental MMSC and LFB protected mice from death, restored the histological structure of damaged lungs, and decreased fibrin deposition. At the same time, 3D MMSC secretome exhibited a more pronounced trend in lung recovery than 2D MMSC and LFB-derived secretome in some measures. Taking together, these studies show that inhalation of cell secretome may also be considered as a potential therapy for the management of ARDS in patients suffering from severe pneumonia, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), however, their effectiveness requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metabolomic Profiling of Respiratory Muscles and Lung in Response to Long-Term Controlled Mechanical Ventilation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical illness myopathy (CIM) and ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD) are characterized by severe muscle wasting, muscle paresis, and extubation failure with subsequent increased medical costs and mortality/morbidity rates in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. These negative effects in response to modern critical care have received increasing attention, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based on experimental and clinical studies from our group, it has been hypothesized that the ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and the release of factors systemically play a significant role in the pathogenesis of CIM and VIDD. Our previous experimental/clinical studies have focused on gene/protein expression and the effects on muscle structure and regulation of muscle contraction at the cell and motor protein levels. In the present study, we have extended our interest to alterations at the metabolomic level. An untargeted metabolomics approach was undertaken to study two respiratory muscles (diaphragm and intercostal muscle) and lung tissue in rats exposed to five days controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV). Metabolomic profiles in diaphragm, intercostal muscles and lung tissue were dramatically altered in response to CMV, most metabolites of which belongs to lipids and amino acids. Some metabolites may possess important biofunctions and play essential roles in the metabolic alterations, such as pyruvate, citrate, S-adenosylhomocysteine, alpha-ketoglutarate, glycerol, and cysteine. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis identified pathway signatures of each tissue, such as decreased metabolites of dipeptides in diaphragm, increased metabolites of branch-chain amino acid metabolism and purine metabolism in intercostals, and increased metabolites of fatty acid metabolism in lung tissue. These metabolite alterations may be associated with an accelerated myofibrillar protein degradation in the two respiratory muscles, an active inflammatory response in all tissues, an attenuated energy production in two respiratory muscles, and enhanced energy production in lung. These results will lay the basis for future clinical studies in ICU patients and hopefully the discovery of biomarkers in early diagnosis and monitoring, as well as the identification of future therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AdMSC-derived exosomes alleviate acute lung injury via transferring mitochondrial component to improve homeostasis of alveolar macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35401830/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Aberrant activation of macrophages with mitochondria dismiss was proved to be associated with pathogenesis of ALI (acute lung injury). Exosomes from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC-Exos) have been distinguished by their low immunogenicity, lack of tumorigenicity, and high clinical safety, but their role in treating ALI and the mechanism involved need to be defined. In this study, we sought to investigate whether the mitochondrial donation from AdMSC-Exos provides profound protection against LPS-induced ALI in mice, accompanied by improvement of macrophage mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice were orotracheally instilled with LPS (1 mg/kg). AdMSC-Exos were administered via the tail vein 4 h after LPS inhalation. Flow cytometry, H&amp;amp;E, Quantitative Real-Time PCR, immunofluorescence (IF), confocal microscopy imaging was conducted to investigate lung tissue inflammation and macrophage mitochondrial function. And further observe the transfer of exosomes and the effect on mitochondrial function of MH-S cells through &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; AdMSC-Exos can transfer the stem cell-derived mitochondria components to alveolar macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Likely through complementing the damaged mitochondria, AdMSC-Exos exhibited the ability to elevate the level of mtDNA, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), OXPHOS activity and ATP generation, while reliving mROS stress in LPS-challenged macrophages. Restoring mitochondrial integrity via AdMSC-Exos treatment enabled macrophages shifting to anti-inflammatory phenotype, as featured with the down-regulation of IL-1β, TNF-α and iNOS secretion and increase in production of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and Arg-1. As we depleted alveolar macrophages using clodronate liposomes, the protective role for AdMSC-Exos was largely abrogated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; AdMSC-Exos can effectively donate mitochondria component improved macrophages mitochondrial integrity and oxidative phosphorylation level, leading to the resumption of metabolic and immune homeostasis of airway macrophages and mitigating lung inflammatory pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epithelial LIF signaling limits apoptosis and lung injury during bacterial pneumonia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35137631/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During bacterial pneumonia, alveolar epithelial cells are critical for maintaining gas exchange and providing antimicrobial as well as pro-immune properties. We previously demonstrated that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an IL-6 family cytokine, is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATII) and is critical for tissue protection during bacterial pneumonia. However, the target cells and mechanisms of LIF-mediated protection remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that antibody-induced LIF blockade remodels the lung epithelial transcriptome in association with increased apoptosis. Based on these data, we performed pneumonia studies using a novel mouse model in which LIFR (the unique receptor for LIF) is absent in lung epithelium. Although LIFR is expressed on the surface of epithelial cells, its absence only minimally contributed to tissue protection during pneumonia. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) was conducted to identify adult murine lung cell types most prominently expressing &lt;em&gt;Lifr&lt;/em&gt;, revealing endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and ATIIs as major sources of &lt;em&gt;Lifr&lt;/em&gt;. Sequencing data indicated that ATII cells were significantly impacted by pneumonia, with additional differences observed in response to LIF neutralization, including but not limited to gene programs related to cell death, injury, and inflammation. Overall, our data suggest that LIF signaling on epithelial cells alters responses in this cell type during pneumonia. However, our results also suggest separate and perhaps more prominent roles of LIFR in other cell types, such as endothelial cells or mesenchymal cells, which provide grounds for future investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Green tea peptides ameliorate diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35234233/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most important cause of middle and late-stage chronic kidney disease. Green tea polypeptides are extracted from tea pomace, and exhibit various pharmacological effects. In this study, we analyzed the reno-protective effects of green tea peptides in diabetic db/db mice, and explored the underlying mechanisms. Peptide treatment for 5 weeks significantly reduced the blood glucose levels and other indices of diabetes, and alleviated renal injury measured in terms of blood creatinine, urea nitrogen and urinary albumin/urinary creatinine levels. Mechanistically, the green tea peptides downregulated p-Smad2/3, α-SMA, ZO-1 and vimentin proteins in the kidney tissues, and elevated Smad7. Thus, green tea peptides inhibited the deposition of ECM proteins by suppressing excessive activation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway and reducing fibronectin levels. On the other hand, tea peptides ameliorated renal injury by inhibiting the production of inflammatory factors (iNOS and TNF-α) by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, we confirmed the inhibitory effect of green tea peptides on the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway in TGF-β1-stimulated HK-2 cells. Therefore, tea peptides can be considered as an effective candidate for alleviating DN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prkg2 regulates alveolar type 2-mediated re-alveolarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35313961/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The cGMP-dependent type 2 protein kinase, encoded by the &lt;em&gt;prkg2&lt;/em&gt; gene, is highly expressed in alveolar type 2 epithelial (AT2) cells. It is unclear whether &lt;em&gt;prkg2&lt;/em&gt; regulates AT2 cell homeostasis and re-alveolarization of injured lungs. This study aimed to investigate the role of &lt;em&gt;prkg2&lt;/em&gt; in the regulation of the fate of AT2 in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Primary AT2 cells of wild-type (wt) and &lt;em&gt;prkg2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice were co-cultured with fibroblasts as three-dimensional organoids. The colony formation was analyzed between days 4 and 12 post-seeding. EdU assay was used to detect cells with active DNA synthesis. AT1 and AT2 cells in organoids were visualized with anti-podoplanin and anti-surfactant protein C antibodies, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;prkg2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; AT2 cells developed a greater number of organoids than wt controls. However, compared to wt organoids, a lower number of AT2 but a greater number of AT1 cells were visualized. In addition, a lower number of proliferated cells (EdU+) were observed in &lt;em&gt;prkg2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; organoids compared to wt controls. The numbers of organoids and EdU+ cells were significantly reduced in protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89-treated wt and &lt;em&gt;prkg2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; cultures. Organoids and EdU+ cells were increased by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in both wt and &lt;em&gt;prkg2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; groups. The increase in the proportion of AT1 and AT2 cells in organoids was only seen in wt controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Prkg2&lt;/em&gt; may regulate the lineage of AT2 cells, which is affected by endotoxins and the interactive PKA signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Renoprotective effect of vinpocetine against ischemia/reperfusion injury: Modulation of NADPH oxidase/Nrf2, IKKβ/NF-κB p65, and cleaved caspase-3 expressions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) during kidney transplantation is a serious clinical problem with a high mortality rate and a lack of therapy. Therefore, there is a need to improve the ability of the kidney to tolerate IRI during transplantation. This study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of vinpocetine; a derivative of vincamine alkaloid; against renal IRI in rats with the elucidation of the involved mechanisms. Vinpocetine (25 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered for 10 successive days before the induction of ischemia by bilateral clamping of both renal pedicles for 45 min followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Blood and renal tissue samples were then collected for biochemical, molecular, and histopathological investigations. Vinpocetine significantly reduced serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels in rats subjected to IRI. It also reduced mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase and renal content of malondialdehyde, while enhanced Nrf2 protein expression and renal content of reduced glutathione. The suppression of the provoked inflammatory response was evident by the downregulation of IKKβ and NF-κB p65 protein expressions, as well as their downstream inflammatory markers; tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and myeloperoxidase. In addition, vinpocetine reduced protein expression of the apoptotic executioner cleaved caspase-3. These nephroprotective effects were confirmed by the improvement in histopathological features. Collectively, the protective effect of vinpocetine against IRI could be attributed to modulation of NADPH oxidase/Nrf2, IKKβ/NF-κB p65, and cleaved caspase-3 expressions. Thus, vinpocetine could improve oxidant/antioxidant balance, suppress triggered inflammatory response, and promote renal cell survival after IRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bidirectional regulation of structural damage on autophagy in the C. elegans epidermis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35311461/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of disturbances such as starvation, organelle damage, heat stress, hypoxia and pathogen infection can influence the autophagic process. However, how the macroautophagy/autophagy machinery is regulated intrinsically by structural damage of the cell remains largely unknown. In this work, we utilized the &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; epidermis as the model to address this question. Our results showed that structural damage by mechanical wounding exerted proximal inhibitory effect and distant promotional effect on autophagy within the same epidermal cell. By disrupting individual mechanical supporting structures, we found that only damage of the basal extracellular matrix or the underlying muscle cells activated a distinct autophagic response in the epidermis. On the contrary, structural disruption of the epidermal cells at the apical side inhibited autophagy activation caused by different stress factors. Mechanistic studies showed that the basal promotional effect of structural damage on epidermal autophagy was mediated by a mechanotransduction pathway going through the basal hemidesmosome receptor and LET-363/MTOR, while the apical inhibitory effect was mostly carried out by activation of calcium signaling. Elevated autophagy in the epidermis played a detrimental rather than a beneficial role on cell survival against structural damage. The results obtained from these studies will not only help us better understand the pathogenesis of structural damage- and autophagy-related diseases, but also provide insight into more generic rules of autophagy regulation by the structural and mechanical properties of cells across species.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GSPE Protects against Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in Mice via Ameliorating Epithelial Apoptosis through Inhibition of Oxidative Stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35355866/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown cause which leads to alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis followed by basement membrane disruption and accumulation of extracellular matrix, destroying the lung architecture. Oxidative stress is involved in the development of alveolar injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Oxidative stress-mediated alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis is suggested to be a key process in the pathogenesis of IPF. Therefore, the present study investigated whether grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) could inhibit the development of pulmonary fibrosis via ameliorating epithelial apoptosis through the inhibition of oxidative stress. We found that GSPE significantly ameliorated the histological changes and the level of collagen deposition in bleomycin (BLM)-induced lungs. Moreover, GSPE attenuated lung inflammation by reducing the total number of cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and decreasing the expression of IL-6. We observed that the levels of H2O2 leading to oxidative stress were increased following BLM instillation, which significantly decreased with GSPE treatment both in vivo and in vitro. These findings showed that GSPE attenuated BLM-induced epithelial apoptosis in the mouse lung and A549 alveolar epithelial cell through the inhibition of oxidative stress. Furthermore, GSPE could attenuate mitochondrial-associated cell apoptosis via decreasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The present study demonstrates that GSPE could ameliorate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice via inhibition of epithelial apoptosis through the inhibition of oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histone Extraction from Human Articular Cartilage for the Study of Epigenetic Regulation in Osteoarthritis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease that affects articular cartilage, causing its degeneration. Although OA is one of the most prevalent pathologies globally, there are no definitive treatments available. Recently, research has focused on elucidating the complex interplay that takes place between inflammatory processes and epigenetic regulation, showing that histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) can exert a pronounced effect on the expression of OA-related genes. OA chondrocytes enhance the production of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), which are epigenetically regulated. These cytokines upregulate the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases, which promote the extracellular matrix (ECM) destruction. This motivates the study of histone PTMs to investigate the epigenetic regulation of proinflammatory molecules, but the absence of specific protocols to extract histones from human articular cartilage has complicated this task. The lack of effective methods can be explained by the structural complexity and low cellularity of this tissue, which are responsible for the biomechanical properties that allow the movement of the joint but also complicate histone isolation. Here, we provide a histone extraction procedure specifically adapted for cryopreserved human articular cartilage that can be useful to understand epigenetic regulation in OA and accelerate the search for novel strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Combined Transcriptomic and Proteomic Approach to Reveal the Effect of Mogroside V on OVA-Induced Pulmonary Inflammation in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35371026/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mogroside V is a bioactive ingredient extracted from the natural food Siraitia grosvenorii which possesses functions that stimulate lung humidification and cough relief activities, but its underlying mechanisms were rarely studied. To estimate its potential protective effect on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced pulmonary inflammation and understand its system-wide mechanism, integrated omics was applied in this study. Mogroside V effectively reduced the levels of IgE, TNF-α, and IL-5 in OVA-induced mice. The results of RNA-seq and data-independent acquisition proteomics approach revealed that 944 genes and 341 proteins were differentially expressed in the normal control group (NC) and ovalbumin-induced control group (OC) and 449 genes and 259 proteins were differentially expressed between the OC and the group treated with 50 mg/kg mogroside V (MV). After a combined analysis of the transcriptome and the proteome, 93 major pathways were screened, and we discovered that mogroside V exerts an anti-inflammation effect in the lung via NF-κB and JAK-STAT, both of which are among the signaling pathways mentioned above. In addition, we found that the key regulatory molecules (Igha, Ighg1, NF-κB, Jak1, and Stat1) in the two pathways were activated in inflammation and inhibited by mogroside V. Thus, mogroside V may be the main bioactivity component in S. grosvenorii that exerts lung humidification and cough relief effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-22 Plays a Dual Role in the Amniotic Cavity: Tissue Injury and Host Defense against Microbes in Preterm Labor</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35304419/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IL-22 is a multifaceted cytokine with both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions that is implicated in multiple pathologies. However, the role of IL-22 in maternal-fetal immunity in late gestation is poorly understood. In this study, we first showed that IL-22&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells coexpressing retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (ROR-γt) are enriched at the human maternal-fetal interface of women with preterm labor and birth, which was confirmed by in silico analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. T cell activation leading to preterm birth in mice was preceded by a surge in IL-22 in the maternal circulation and amniotic cavity; however, systemic administration of IL-22 in mice did not induce adverse perinatal outcomes. Next, using an ex vivo human system, we showed that IL-22 can cross from the choriodecidua to the intra-amniotic space, where its receptors (&lt;em&gt;Il22ra1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il10rb&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Il22ra2&lt;/em&gt;) are highly expressed by murine gestational and fetal tissues in late pregnancy. Importantly, amniotic fluid concentrations of IL-22 were elevated in women with sterile or microbial intra-amniotic inflammation, suggesting a dual role for this cytokine. The intra-amniotic administration of IL-22 alone shortened gestation and caused neonatal death in mice, with the latter outcome involving lung maturation and inflammation. IL-22 plays a role in host response by participating in the intra-amniotic inflammatory milieu preceding &lt;em&gt;Ureaplasma parvum&lt;/em&gt;-induced preterm birth in mice, which was rescued by the deficiency of IL-22. Collectively, these data show that IL-22 alone is capable of causing fetal injury leading to neonatal death and can participate in host defense against microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity leading to preterm labor and birth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freshwater environmental antibiotic pollution is becoming more severe because of the irregular use of sulfonamide antibiotics. Sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) is a kind of antibiotic that can cause harm to the urinary systems of organisms. However, the toxic impacts of environment-related concentrations of antibiotics in fish have not been thoroughly studied. Lycopene (LYC) has the property of alleviating antibiotic toxicity by diminishing oxidative stress and inflammation. This investigation is intended to examine the instrument of the mitigative part of LYC on SMZ-caused renal inflammatory injury in grass carp. Grass carp were born with SMZ (0. 3 μg L-1) and LYC (10 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days. Serum was used to measure creatinine (CREA) and urea nitrogen (BUN) contents; what is more, kidneys were used to measure histological structure, oxidative stress indicators, relative expressions of cytokines, and inflammatory factors. We found that SMZ exposure significantly increased oxidative stress, characterized by decreased catalase activity (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). In addition, inflammation-related factors: interleukin (IL-18, IL-6, and IL-1β), an apoptotic speck-containing protein with a card (ASC), NOD-like receptor protein3 (NLRP3), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-1 (caspase-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and nuclear factor-activated B cells (NF-κB) expression increased significantly contrasted with those control group. Inflammatory reactions and ultrastructural changes accompany. LYC administration alleviated the changes mentioned above. In conclusion, In conclusion, these results suggest a protective effect of LYC dietary supplements against kidney damage caused by SMZ. LYC is expected to prevent and treat oxidative stress and chronic inflammation caused by antibiotics as a critical component in the fish breeding diet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has incited a global health crisis. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We evaluated the antiviral activity of sulforaphane (SFN), the principal biologically active phytochemical derived from glucoraphanin, the naturally occurring precursor present in high concentrations in cruciferous vegetables. SFN inhibited in vitro replication of six strains of SARS-CoV-2, including Delta and Omicron, as well as that of the seasonal coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Further, SFN and remdesivir interacted synergistically to inhibit coronavirus infection in vitro. Prophylactic administration of SFN to K18-hACE2 mice prior to intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly decreased the viral load in the lungs and upper respiratory tract and reduced lung injury and pulmonary pathology compared to untreated infected mice. SFN treatment diminished immune cell activation in the lungs, including significantly lower recruitment of myeloid cells and a reduction in T cell activation and cytokine production. Our results suggest that SFN should be explored as a potential agent for the prevention or treatment of coronavirus infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Activation of AMPK/NRF2 Pathway in Lung Epithelial Cells Is Involved in the Protective Effects of Kinsenoside on Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35340214/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disorder of mitochondrial dynamic equilibrium of lung epithelial cell is one of the critical causes of acute lung injury (ALI). Kinsenoside (Kin) serves as an active small-molecule component derived from traditional medicinal herb displaying multiple pharmacological actions in cancers, hyperglycemia, and liver disease. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Kin on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ALI and further explore possible molecular mechanisms. Kin was administered orally (100 mg/kg/day) for 7 consecutive days before LPS instillation (5 mg/kg). After 12 hours, pathological injury, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress were detected. The results demonstrated that Kin significantly alleviated lung pathological injury and decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the release of inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), apart from inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Meanwhile, Kin also promoted mitochondrial fusion and restrained mitochondrial fission in mice with ALI. In terms of mechanism, Kin pretreatment increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the protein level of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). In &lt;em&gt;Ampk-α&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice challenged with LPS, Kin lost its pulmonary protective effects, accompanied by lower NRF2 level. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments further unveiled that either AMPK inhibition by Compound C or NRF2 knockdown by siRNA abolished the protective roles of Kin in LPS-treated A549 lung epithelial cells. And NRF2 activator TAT-14 could reverse the effects of &lt;em&gt;Ampk-α&lt;/em&gt; deficiency. In conclusion, Kin possesses the ability to prevent LPS-induced ALI by modulating mitochondrial dynamic equilibrium in lung epithelial cell in an AMPK/NRF2-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emodin Protects Against Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Lung Injury via the JNK/Nur77/c-Jun Signaling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35370650/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious inflammatory disease with clinical manifestations of hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Presently, there is no effective treatment of ALI. Although emodin from Rheum palmatum L. exerts anti-ALI properties, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanism of emodin on LPS-induced ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; RAW264.7 cells and zebrafish larvae were stimulated by LPS to establish inflammatory models. The anti-inflammatory effect of emodin was assessed by ELISA, flow cytometric analysis, and survival analysis. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; mechanisms were explored by using Western blotting, luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach. The acute lung injury model in mice was established by the intratracheal administration of LPS, and the underlying mechanisms were assessed by detecting changes in histopathological and inflammatory markers and Western blotting in lung tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Emodin inhibited the inflammatory factor production and oxidative stress in RAW264.7 cells, and prolonged the survival of zebrafish larvae after LPS stimulation. Emodin suppressed the expression levels of phosphorylated JNK at Thr183/tyr182 and phosphorylated Nur77 at Ser351 and c-Jun, and increased the expression level of Nur77 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, while these regulatory effects of emodin on Nur77/c-Jun were counteracted by JNK activators. The overexpression of JNK dampened the emodin-mediated increase in Nur77 luciferase activity and Nur77 expression. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of emodin on c-Jun can be attenuated by Nur77 siRNA. Furthermore, emodin alleviated LPS-induced ALI in mice through the regulation of the JNK/Nur77/c-Jun pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Emodin protects against LPS-induced ALI through regulation on JNK/Nur77/c-Jun signaling. Our results indicate the potential of emodin in the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-6 Prevents Lung Macrophage Death and Lung Inflammation Injury by Inhibiting GSDME- and GSDMD-Mediated Pyroptosis during Pneumococcal Pneumosepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35297653/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumococcal pneumonia has been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout human history. Failing to control pneumococcal pneumonia and resolve ongoing inflammation in a host can cause sepsis, namely pneumococcal pneumosepsis, and death ensues. Few theories have suggested an optimally therapeutic option for this infectious disease. The interleukin-6 (IL-6, a cytokine featuring pleiotropic activity) theory, proposed here, implies that IL-6 acts as a protector against pneumococcal pneumosepsis. IL-6 prevents lung macrophage death and lung inflammation injury by inhibiting a caspase-3-GSDME-mediated switch from apoptosis to pyroptosis and inhibiting caspase-1-GSDMD-mediated classic pyroptosis during pneumococcal pneumosepsis. Thus, IL-6 is an important determinant for controlling bacterial invasion and a homeostatic coordinator of pneumococcal pneumosepsis. This study clarifies a novel mechanism of occurrence and development of pneumonia and secondary sepsis following a Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. It is important for the early identification and treatment of pneumococcal pneumosepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acute Kidney Injury Associates with Long-Term Increases in Plasma TNFR1, TNFR2, and KIM-1: Findings from the CRIC Study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35296554/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Some markers of inflammation-TNF receptors 1 and 2 (TNFR1 and TNFR2)-are independently associated with progressive CKD, as is a marker of proximal tubule injury, kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1). However, whether an episode of hospitalized AKI may cause long-term changes in these biomarkers is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Among adult participants in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study, we identified 198 episodes of hospitalized AKI (defined as peak/nadir inpatient serum creatinine values ≥1.5). For each AKI hospitalization, we found the best matched non-AKI hospitalization (unique patients), using prehospitalization characteristics, including eGFR and urine protein/creatinine ratio. We measured TNFR1, TNFR2, and KIM-1 in banked plasma samples collected at annual CRIC study visits before and after the hospitalization (a median of 7 months before and 5 months after hospitalization).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In the AKI and non-AKI groups, we found similar prehospitalization median levels of TNFR1 (1373 pg/ml versus 1371 pg/ml, for AKI and non-AKI, respectively), TNFR2 (47,141 pg/ml versus 46,135 pg/ml, respectively), and KIM-1 (857 pg/ml versus 719 pg/ml, respectively). Compared with matched study participants who did not experience AKI, study participants who did experience AKI had greater increases in TNFR1 (23% versus 10%, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), TNFR2 (10% versus 3%, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and KIM-1 (13% versus -2%, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Among patients with CKD, AKI during hospitalization was associated with increases in plasma TNFR1, TNFR2, and KIM-1 several months after their hospitalization. These results highlight a potential mechanism by which AKI may contribute to more rapid loss of kidney function months to years after the acute insult.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanoformulation of a carbon monoxide releasing molecule protects against cyclosporin A-induced nephrotoxicity and renal fibrosis via the suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated TGF-β/Smad pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclosporin A (CsA) induced nephrotoxicity i.e., renal fibrosis is a critical clinical problem in renal transplant patients, in which chronic inflammatory response is the major cause. Previously, we developed a nano-drug delivery system for carbon monoxide (CO), a multi-functional gaseous molecule with a potent anti-inflammatory effect, i.e., SMA/CORM2, which showed therapeutic potential in several inflammatory disease models. Accordingly, in this study, we explored the potential and usefulness of SMA/CORM2 on CsA induced renal fibrosis. When mice were exposed to CsA for 4 weeks, severe injuries in the kidney as revealed by decreased kidney function and histological examination, and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as renal fibrosis along with the upregulation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)/Smad signaling molecule were observed, whereas SMA/CORM2 (1 mg/kg) treatment remarkably ameliorated the inflammatory injury and fibrosis in the kidney. CO is the major effector molecule of SMA/CORM2 which significantly suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, and induced the downregulation of TGFβ/Smad signaling. Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome by its inhibitor MCC950 also similarly decreased TGFβ/Smad expression and subsequently improved kidney injury and renal fibrosis, suggesting SMA/CORM2 induced suppression of TGFβ/Smad signaling and renal signaling via an NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pathway. Compared to native CORM2, SMA/CORM2 exhibited better therapeutic/preventive effects owing to its superior water-solubility and bioavailability. These findings strongly indicated the applicability of SMA/CORM2 as an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect-based nanomedicine for CsA induced renal fibrosis as well as other inflammatory diseases. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important gaseous signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in the maintenance of homeostasis. Because of its versatile functions, it exhibits the potential as the target molecule for many diseases, including inflammatory diseases and cancer. The development of stable and disease-targeted delivery systems of CO is thus of interest and importance. Previously we developed a nano micellar CO donor SMA/CORM2 which shows superior bioavailability and therapeutic potential in many inflammatory disease models. We reported here, SMA/CORM2, through controlled release of CO, greatly ameliorated CsA-induced renal fibrosis via suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated TGF-β/Smad pathway. These findings suggest a new anti-inflammatory mechanism of CO, which also provides a new approach for controlling CsA-induced nephrotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DNA-PKcs interacts with and phosphorylates Fis1 to induce mitochondrial fragmentation in tubular cells during acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35290083/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) regulates cell death. We sought to determine whether DNA-PKcs played a role in the tubular damage that occurs during acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by LPS injection (to mimic sepsis), cisplatin administration, or renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Although DNA-PKcs normally localizes to the nucleus, we detected cytoplasmic DNA-PKcs in mouse kidney tissues and urinary sediments of human patients with septic AKI. Increased cytoplasmic amounts of DNA-PKcs correlated with renal dysfunction. Tubule cell-specific &lt;em&gt;DNA-PKcs&lt;/em&gt; deletion attenuated AKI-mediated tubular cell death and changes in the abundance of various proteins with mitochondrial functions or roles in apoptotic pathways. DNA-PKcs interacted with Fis1 and phosphorylated it at Thr&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; in its TQ motif, which increased the affinity of Fis1 for Drp1 and induced mitochondrial fragmentation. Knockin mice expressing a nonphosphorylatable T34A mutant exhibited improved renal function and histological features and reduced mitochondrial fragmentation upon induction of AKI. Phosphorylation of Thr&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; in Fis1 was detectable in urinary sediments of human patients with septic AKI and correlated with renal dysfunction. Our findings provide insight into the role of cytoplasmic DNA-PKcs and phosphorylated Fis1 in AKI development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>L-plastin enhances NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35294888/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macrophages require L-plastin for optimal NLRP3 inflammasome activation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPL stabilizes Pyk2 kinase interaction with ASC in NLRP3 assembly to link podosomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podosome-mediated mechanotransduction in inflammasome signaling requires L-plastin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L-plastin supports bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis via NLRP3 pathway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophage adhesion and stretching have been shown to induce interleukin (IL)-1β production, but the mechanism of this mechanotransduction remains unclear. Here we specify the molecular link between mechanical tension on tissue-resident macrophages and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which governs IL-1β production. NLRP3 activation enhances antimicrobial defense, but excessive NLRP3 activity causes inflammatory tissue damage in conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. We find that the actin-bundling protein L-plastin (LPL) significantly enhances NLRP3 assembly. Specifically, LPL enables apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC) oligomerization during NLRP3 assembly by stabilizing ASC interactions with the kinase Pyk2, a component of cell-surface adhesive structures called podosomes. Upon treatment with exogenous NLRP3 activators, lung-resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) lacking LPL exhibit reduced caspase-1 activity, IL-1β cleavage, and gasdermin-D processing. &lt;em&gt;LPL&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice display resistance to bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis. These findings identify the LPL-Pyk2-ASC pathway as a target for modulation in NLRP3-mediated inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy is activated to protect against AFB1-induced kidney damage in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35304092/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aflatoxin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (AFB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a toxic food pollutant that has extensive deleterious impacts on the kidney. Oxidative stress represents the primary mechanism of AFB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; nephrotoxicity and can also cause mitochondrial damage. Damaged mitochondria can trigger apoptosis leading to kidney injury. PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy can alleviate mitochondrial injury to maintain cellular homeostasis, however, its role in AFB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-induced kidney damage is unknown. To investigate the effect of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy on kidney impairment triggered by AFB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 40 male wild-type (WT) C57BL/6N mice were first assigned to 4 groups and orally exposed to AFB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mg/kg body weight (BW) for 28 days. The results revealed that AFB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; induced kidney damage, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, apoptosis and activated PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy with a dose-dependent effect. Then, 20 male WT C57BL/6N mice and 20 male Parkin knockout (Parkin&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) C57BL/6N mice were assigned to 4 groups and orally exposed to AFB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at 0, 1, 0, and 1 mg/kg BW for 28 days. The results revealed that Parkin&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; suppressed mitophagy and exacerbated kidney damage, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis under AFB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. The aforementioned evidences demonstrate that PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy is activated by AFB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and protects against kidney damage in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Airway secretory cell fate conversion via YAP-mTORC1-dependent essential amino acid metabolism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35285539/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue homeostasis requires lineage fidelity of stem cells. Dysregulation of cell fate specification and differentiation leads to various diseases, yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing these processes remain elusive. We demonstrate that YAP/TAZ activation reprograms airway secretory cells, which subsequently lose their cellular identity and acquire squamous alveolar type 1 (AT1) fate in the lung. This cell fate conversion is mediated via distinctive transitional cell states of damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs), recently shown to emerge during injury repair in mouse and human lungs. We further describe a YAP/TAZ signaling cascade to be integral for the fate conversion of secretory cells into AT1 fate, by modulating mTORC1/ATF4-mediated amino acid metabolism &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Importantly, we observed aberrant activation of the YAP/TAZ-mTORC1-ATF4 axis in the altered airway epithelium of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, including substantial emergence of DATPs and AT1 cells with severe pulmonary fibrosis. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of mTORC1 activity suppresses lineage alteration and subepithelial fibrosis driven by YAP/TAZ activation, proposing a potential therapeutic target for human fibrotic lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synopsis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The molecular programs underlying injury-induced plasticity in the lung epithelium remain unclear. Here, combined genetic and expression analysis uncovers YAP/TAZ as a driver of cell fate-converting metabolic signaling in the airways, offering new potential targets for human lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustained YAP/TAZ activation in airway secretory cells induces differentiation into squamous alveolar type 1 (AT1) fate, perturbed tissue architecture, and fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single-cell profiling shows transient cell states of damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs) during secretory-to-AT1 cell transition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YAP/TAZ-dependent uptake of essential amino acids via the Slc7a5/LAT1 is required for the acquisition of DATP-AT1 cell fates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mTORC1 and ATF4 mediate YAP/TAZ-dependent amino acid metabolism and cell fate conversion in ex vivo organoids and in vivo mouse lungs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients with pulmonary fibrosis show aberrant activation of YAP/TAZ and mTORC1-ATF4 signaling in the airways.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Fengreqing Oral Liquid Exerts Anti-Inflammatory Effects by Promoting Apoptosis and Inhibiting PI3K/AKT and NF-κB Signaling Pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35370749/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fengreqing oral liquid (FOL), a Chinese patent drug frequently used in clinical practice in China, is effective in treating inflammatory diseases of the upper respiratory tract such as colds and flu. However, its anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of FOL and its mechanisms on PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells were explored, as well as the regulatory effect of FOL on apoptosis. In addition, the potential of FOL for the treatment of acute lung injury was explored in LPS-induced ALI mice. The results showed that treatment with FOL significantly reduced the levels of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in the supernatant of LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, and also significantly reduced the phosphorylated protein levels of PI3K and AKT in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and also protein levels of NF-κB p50, phosphorylated NF-κB p65, and IκBα in the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, the results showed that FOL induced apoptosis in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells at the level of 80%-90%, and significantly increased the protein expression levels of the pro-apoptotic Bax and cleaved-caspase-3. In LPS-induced ALI mice, FOL administration showed inhibition of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and decreased protein expression levels of PI3K, AKT, NF-κB p50, and NF-κB p65, and elevated protein expression levels of Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 significantly. These results suggest that FOL may exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote apoptosis and leading to attenuated activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Injury-induced inflammatory signaling and hematopoiesis in Drosophila</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35286208/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explore mechanisms by which stress caused by acute injury affects blood cell development and inflammatory response in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;. Similar to their mammalian myeloid counterparts, these cells are predisposed to sense and react to sterile injury at distant sites. Upon sterile injury, a breach of epidermis sets up a reactive oxygen species-based signal that bypasses the pathogen-sensing apparatus of septic immune challenge, but merges downstream to activate Toll. A number of autonomous and nonautonomous signaling pathways follow in a sequence and are mapped temporally by the appearance of their corresponding molecular phenotypes. A cell-type that fights deposited parasitic wasp eggs appears with sterile injury without the immune challenge, perhaps in anticipation, because in nature injury is usually followed by infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory response in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; to sterile (axenic) injury in embryos and adults has received some attention in recent years, and most concentrate on the events at the injury site. Here we focus on the effect sterile injury has on the hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, and the circulating blood cells in the larva, the developmental stage at which major events of hematopoiesis are evident. In mammals, injury activates Toll-like receptor/NF-κB signaling in macrophages, which then express and secrete secondary, proinflammatory cytokines. In &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; larvae, distal puncture injury of the body wall epidermis causes a rapid activation of Toll and Jun kinase (JNK) signaling throughout the hematopoietic system and the differentiation of a unique blood cell type, the lamellocyte. Furthermore, we find that Toll and JNK signaling are coupled in their activation. Secondary to this Toll/JNK response, a cytokine, Upd3, is induced as a Toll pathway transcriptional target, which then promotes JAK/STAT signaling within the blood cells. Toll and JAK/STAT signaling are required for the emergence of the injury-induced lamellocytes. This is akin to the derivation of specialized macrophages in mammalian systems. Upstream, at the injury site, a Duox- and peroxide-dependent signal causes the activation of the proteases Grass and SPE, needed for the activation of the Toll-ligand Spz, but microbial sensors or the proteases most closely associated with them during septic injury are not involved in the axenic inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial Protein Akap 1 Deletion Exacerbates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Mice Exposed to Hyperoxia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35370705/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe manifestation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are treated with high concentrations of supplementary oxygen. However, prolonged exposure to high oxygen concentrations stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damages the mitochondria and accumulates misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mitochondrial protein A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (&lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;/em&gt;) is critical for mitochondrial homeostasis. It is known that &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency results in heart damage, neuronal development impairment, and mitochondrial malfunction in preclinical studies. Our laboratory recently revealed that deleting &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;/em&gt; increases the severity of hyperoxia-induced ALI in mice. To assess the role of &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;/em&gt; deletion in ER stress in lung injury, wild-type and &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice were exposed to hyperoxia for 48 h. This study indicates that &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice exposed to hyperoxia undergo ER stress, which is associated with an increased expression of BiP, JNK phosphorylation, eIF2α phosphorylation, ER stress-induced cell death, and autophagy. This work demonstrates that deleting &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;/em&gt; results in increased ER stress in the lungs of mice and that hyperoxia exacerbates ER stress-related consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The arginine methyltransferase PRMT7 promotes extravasation of monocytes resulting in tissue injury in COPD</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35288557/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extravasation of monocytes into tissue and to the site of injury is a fundamental immunological process, which requires rapid responses via post translational modifications (PTM) of proteins. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) is an epigenetic factor that has the capacity to mono-methylate histones on arginine residues. Here we show that in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, PRMT7 expression is elevated in the lung tissue and localized to the macrophages. In mouse models of COPD, lung fibrosis and skin injury, reduced expression of PRMT7 associates with decreased recruitment of monocytes to the site of injury and hence less severe symptoms. Mechanistically, activation of NF-κB/RelA in monocytes induces PRMT7 transcription and consequential mono-methylation of histones at the regulatory elements of RAP1A, which leads to increased transcription of this gene that is responsible for adhesion and migration of monocytes. Persistent monocyte-derived macrophage accumulation leads to ALOX5 over-expression and accumulation of its metabolite LTB4, which triggers expression of ACSL4 a ferroptosis promoting gene in lung epithelial cells. Conclusively, inhibition of arginine mono-methylation might offer targeted intervention in monocyte-driven inflammatory conditions that lead to extensive tissue damage if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bmi1 signaling maintains the plasticity of airway epithelial progenitors in response to persistent silica exposures</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicosis is caused by the continuous inhalation of environmental silica dust. The repetitive exposure of silica induces airway epithelial cell injury, leads proliferative exhaustion of epithelial stem cells, ultimately results in the lung remodeling and the development of silicosis. The B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi1) is a pivotal transcription factor in stem cell self-renewal and proliferation of many tissues including the lung, but its role in the airway basal cell proliferation and differentiation during the pathogenesis of silicosis in lung has yet been investigated. In this study, the function of Bmi1 in airway basal cell proliferation and differentiation in response to silica challenge was investigated in lungs of silicosis mice and primary human bronchial epithelia cells (HBECs) exposed to silica dioxide (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Results showed a decreased expression of Bmi1 protein, epithelial basal cell markers Krt14 and Krt5, club cell marker Clara cell secretory protein, and ciliated cell marker acetyl-α-tubulin in silicosis lungs, compared to healthy mice. In consistence, a persistent exposure of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduced the capacity of cell proliferation and differentiation in HBECs, as ascertained by the reduction of differentiated epithelial cell markers and BMI1 expression, while an increased P21-positive senescent cell fraction. Moreover, an overexpression of BMI1 in HBECs reduced the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-senescent cells, enhanced the potency of cell proliferation and differentiation, and increased capacity of airway epithelial regeneration in response to the persistent exposure of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These data suggest that Bmi1 is a key transcription factor engaging in maintaining the self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation of epithelial stem cells in lung during the development of silicosis disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Near-infrared fluorescence imaging during ex vivo lung perfusion: Noninvasive real-time evaluation of regional lung perfusion and edema</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35382935/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; lung perfusion (EVLP) is an excellent platform to evaluate donor lung function before transplantation, but novel methods are needed to accurately confirm transplant quality. Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) has been used in various clinical perioperative applications to evaluate tissue perfusion. We used NIRF imaging during pig and human EVLP to evaluate donor lung perfusion and edema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Pig lungs with various degrees of lung injury (n = 10) and human lungs rejected from clinical transplantation (n = 3) were imaged during EVLP using intravascular ICG and a SPY Elite (Stryker) NIRF imaging unit. Optimal ICG and imaging conditions, and perfusion and edema quantification methods, were established. Pig lung transplants with extended graft preservation (n = 5) and control native lungs (n = 6) were also imaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A single ICG dose resulted in sustained donor lung NIRF throughout the EVLP. Even and homogenous ICG signal was demonstrated in areas of normal lung. Low NIRF was present in regions with poor tissue perfusion, and rapid, intense ICG accumulation occurred in damaged and edematous areas. Segmental perfusion defects were common in the peripheral and elevated regions of the lungs, and serial imaging showed gradual perfusion recovery during EVLP. Impaired microvascular reperfusion, indicated by a decreased NIRF ingress rate, was detected in transplanted pig lungs early after reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; NIRF imaging enables noninvasive real-time evaluation of lung perfusion and edema during EVLP. Prospective clinical studies are needed to determine the role of NIRF imaging in donor lung assessment and selection, and prediction of posttransplant outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Role of Long Noncoding RNA MALAT1 in Diabetic Polyneuropathy and the Impact of Its Silencing in the Dorsal Root Ganglion by a DNA/RNA Heteroduplex Oligonucleotide</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35276003/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is the most common complication of diabetes, yet its pathophysiology has not been established. Accumulating evidence suggests that long noncoding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) plays pivotal roles in the regulation of cell growth and survival during diabetic complications. This study aimed to investigate the impact of MALAT1 silencing in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, using an α-tocopherol-conjugated DNA/RNA heteroduplex oligonucleotide (Toc-HDO), on the peripheral nervous system of diabetic mice. We identified MALAT1 upregulation in the DRG of chronic diabetic mice that suggested either a pathological change or one that might be protective, and systemic intravenous injection of Toc-HDO effectively inhibited its gene expression. However, we unexpectedly noted that this intervention paradoxically exacerbated disease with increased thermal and mechanical nociceptive thresholds, indicating further sensory loss, greater sciatic-tibial nerve conduction slowing, and additional declines of intraepidermal nerve fiber density in the hind paw footpads. Serine/arginine-rich splicing factors, which are involved in pre-mRNA splicing by interacting with MALAT1, reside in nuclear speckles in wild-type and diabetic DRG neurons; MALAT1 silencing was associated with their disruption. The findings provide evidence for an important role that MALAT1 plays in DPN, suggesting neuroprotection and regulation of pre-mRNA splicing in nuclear speckles. This is also the first example in which a systemically delivered nucleotide therapy had a direct impact on DRG diabetic neurons and their axons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Actin-related protein 2/3 complex regulates neutrophil extracellular trap expulsion and lung damage in abdominal sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35272488/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is a key feature in sepsis. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of the actin cytoskeleton in regulating the expulsion of NETs. Actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp 2/3) complex is an important regulator of F-actin polymerization. Coincubation with CK666, a specific Arp 2/3 inhibitor, decreased 12-phorbol 13-myristate acetate-induced NET formation in vitro. CK666 not only abolished F-actin polymerization but also caused intracellular retention of NETs. Inhibition of Arp 2/3 reduced NET formation on circulating neutrophils and in the bronchoalveolar space in mice undergoing cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Notably, treatment with CK666 attenuated CLP-induced neutrophil recruitment, edema formation, and tissue damage in the lungs. Moreover, Arp 2/3 inhibition decreased levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL-1) and interleukin-6 in the lung and plasma of septic animals. Taken together, this study shows that expulsion of NETs is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton and that inhibition of Arp 2/3-dependent F-actin polymerization not only decreases NET formation but also protects against pathological inflammation and tissue damage in septic lung injury. Thus, we suggest that targeting NET release is a novel and useful way to ameliorate lung damage in abdominal sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microarray Analysis Reveals the Changes in Circular RNA Expression and Molecular Mechanisms in Mice With Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35360228/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular RNA (circRNA) expression profiles in lung tissues from mice with and without ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to clarify their potential role in VILI pathogenesis and provide valuable molecular markers for VILI diagnosis and treatment. A VILI mouse model was established using high-tidal volume ventilation, and lung tissue was stained with HE and TUNEL. The present study used high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze the expression profile of circRNAs in the lung tissue of mice with and without VILI. Bioinformatics was used to analyze the enrichment of differentially expressed circRNAs using Gene Ontology and KEGG to predict function. Among the top 10 circRNAs with significant differential expression, we used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction technology (qRT-PCR) to verify the accuracy of the high-throughput sequencing results and constructed the corresponding circRNA-miRNA-mRNA-specific binding network map using software prediction. The most upregulated circRNAs were novel_circ_0000899 and novel_circ_0014815, and the most downregulated circRNAs were novel_circ_0015069. A total of 14,347 circRNAs were detected using high-throughput sequencing. Compared to the control group, 285 circRNAs were abnormally and significantly expressed in the lung tissues of VILI mice (|log2(FC)| &amp;gt; 1, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). A total of 171 circRNAs were significantly upregulated, and 114 circRNAs were significantly downregulated. Gene ontology analyses indicated that the differentially expressed circRNAs were involved in multiple biological functions, such as regulation of metabolic processes, protein phosphorylation, and chromatin organization. KEGG pathway analyses revealed that the Ras signaling pathway, rap1 signaling pathway, PI3K - Akt signaling pathway, and ECM receiver interaction were related to the differentially expressed circRNAs. The qRT-PCR verification results were generally consistent with the circRNA expression trends of the high-throughput sequencing data. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network suggested that miRNAs and mRNAs related to circRNAs played a key role in VILI. Differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in the tissues of VILI mice using high-throughput sequencing combined with bioinformatics analysis, and the results lay a foundation for further study of the mechanism of circRNAs in the occurrence and development of VILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scanning laser-induced endothelial injury: a standardized and reproducible thrombosis model for intravital microscopy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35273275/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular injury models are indispensable for studying thrombotic processes in vivo. Amongst the available methods for inducing thrombosis, laser-induced endothelial injury (LIEI) has several unique advantages. However, a lack of methodological standardization and expensive instrumentation remain significant problems decreasing reproducibility and impeding the adoption of LIEI in the wider scientific community. In this, study, we developed a standardized protocol for scanning laser-induced endothelial injury (scanning-LIEI) of murine mesenteric veins using the intrinsic 405 nm laser of a conventional laser scanning confocal microscope. We show that our model produces thrombi with prominent core-shell architectures and minimal radiation-related fluorescence artefacts. In comparison with previous methods, the scanning-LIEI model exhibits reduced experimental variability, enabling the demonstration of dose-response effects for anti-thrombotic drugs using small animal cohorts. Scanning-LIEI using the intrinsic 405 nm laser of a confocal laser scanning microscope represents a new method to induce standardized vascular injury with improved reproducibility of thrombus formation. The reduced need for instrument customisation and user experience means that this model could be more readily adopted in the research community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL10 trains macrophage profibrotic function after lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cx3cr1+ monocyte-derived macrophages (moMacs) are recruited to tissues after injury and are known to have profibrotic effects, but the cell-cell interactions and specific pathways that regulate this polarization and function are incompletely understood. Here we investigate the role of moMac-derived &lt;em&gt;Pdgfa&lt;/em&gt; in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Deletion of Pdgfa with &lt;em&gt;Cx3cr1-CreERT2&lt;/em&gt; decreased bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Among a panel of in vitro macrophage polarizing stimuli, robust induction of Pdgfa was noted with IL10 in both mouse and human moMacs. Likewise, analysis of single-cell data revealed high expression of the receptor &lt;em&gt;IL10RA&lt;/em&gt; in moMacs from human fibrotic lungs. Studies with &lt;em&gt;IL10-GFP&lt;/em&gt; mice revealed that IL10-expressing cells were increased after injury in mice and colocalized with moMacs. Notably, deletion of &lt;em&gt;IL10ra&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Csf1r-Cre:IL10ra&lt;/em&gt; fl/fl mice decreased both &lt;em&gt;Pdgfa&lt;/em&gt; expression in moMacs and lung fibrosis. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel, IL10-dependent mechanism of macrophage polarization leading to fibroblast activation after injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Optimized Two-Herb Chinese Food as Medicine Formula Reduces Cisplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity in the Treatment of Lung Cancer in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35355712/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy is considered a most effective way to treat cancer. However, it is very common that chemotherapy causes unbearable mental and physical side effects to cancer patients, which ultimately reduces the patients&amp;rsquo; confidence of overcoming diseases and compromises the treatment of chemotherapy. Cisplatin (DDP), a widely used anticancer agent for various types of cancers, also damages nontumor cells and tissues, which are mostly related to the activation of the inflammation pathway. Previously, we have discovered a few rational formulas of food as medicine materials that reduced systemic inflammation in &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; models. Hence, this study reports the ability of an optimized traditional Chinese anti-inflammatory formulation capable of synergizing the antitumor effect of DDP &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. More significantly, by formulation of two anti-inflammatory herbal medicine, the &lt;em&gt;Chrysanthemum&lt;/em&gt; × &lt;em&gt;morifolium&lt;/em&gt; (Ramat.) Hemsl [Asteraceae] and &lt;em&gt;Lonicera japonica&lt;/em&gt; Thunb [Caprifoliaceae] with a mediator &lt;em&gt;Glycyrrhiza uralensis&lt;/em&gt; Fisch. ex DC [Fabaceae], a best formula relieved the kidney damage imposed by DDP. Treatments of various combinations of major chemical components of the three herbs also exhibited a similar trend for lowering the DDP-induced nephrotoxicity; however, contrary to that of the formula of herbal extracts, all chemical formulas could not recover the body weight and food intake of the tumor-bearing mice treated by DDP. Our findings suggested that the therapeutic index of DDP-based chemotherapy was able to be improved by minimizing toxicities from the two-herb formula to inhibit the inflammation in mouse tumor models and DDP-induced acute kidney injury mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predictive Accuracy of a Perioperative Laboratory Test-Based Prediction Model for Moderate to Severe Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35258532/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Importance:&lt;/em&gt; Effective treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) is predicated on timely diagnosis; however, the lag in the increase in serum creatinine levels after kidney injury may delay therapy initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To determine the derivation and validation of predictive models for AKI after cardiac surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design, setting, and participants:&lt;/em&gt; Multivariable prediction models were derived based on a retrospective observational cohort of adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery between January 2000 and December 2019 from a US academic medical center (n = 58 526) and subsequently validated on an external cohort from 3 US community hospitals (n = 4734). The date of final follow-up was January 15, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exposures:&lt;/em&gt; Perioperative change in serum creatinine and postoperative blood urea nitrogen, serum sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and albumin from the first metabolic panel after cardiac surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main outcomes and measures:&lt;/em&gt; Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration measures for moderate to severe AKI, per Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and AKI requiring dialysis prediction models within 72 hours and 14 days following surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In a derivation cohort of 58 526 patients (median [IQR] age, 66 [56-74] years; 39 173 [67%] men; 51 503 [91%] White participants), the rates of moderate to severe AKI and AKIrequiring dialysis were 2674 (4.6%) and 868 (1.48%) within 72 hours and 3156 (5.4%) and 1018 (1.74%) within 14 days after surgery. The median (IQR) interval to first metabolic panel from conclusion of the surgical procedure was 10 (7-12) hours. In the derivation cohort, the metabolic panel-based models had excellent predictive discrimination for moderate to severe AKI within 72 hours (AUC, 0.876 [95% CI, 0.869-0.883]) and 14 days (AUC, 0.854 [95% CI, 0.850-0.861]) after the surgical procedure and for AKI requiring dialysis within 72 hours (AUC, 0.916 [95% CI, 0.907-0.926]) and 14 days (AUC, 0.900 [95% CI, 0.889-0.909]) after the surgical procedure. In the validation cohort of 4734 patients (median [IQR] age, 67 (60-74) years; 3361 [71%] men; 3977 [87%] White participants), the models for moderate to severe AKI after the surgical procedure showed AUCs of 0.860 (95% CI, 0.838-0.882) within 72 hours and 0.842 (95% CI, 0.820-0.865) within 14 days and the models for AKI requiring dialysis and 14 days had an AUC of 0.879 (95% CI, 0.840-0.918) within 72 hours and 0.873 (95% CI, 0.836-0.910) within 14 days after the surgical procedure. Calibration assessed by Spiegelhalter z test showed P &amp;gt;.05 indicating adequate calibration for both validation and derivation models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions and relevance:&lt;/em&gt; Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, a prediction model based on perioperative basic metabolic panel laboratory values demonstrated good predictive accuracy for moderate to severe acute kidney injury within 72 hours and 14 days after the surgical procedure. Further research is needed to determine whether use of the risk prediction tool improves clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The suppressive effects of Mer inhibition on inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis of LPS-induced ALI/ARDS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35258998/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathogenesis of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has not yet been fully elucidated. Growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) has marked effects on hemostasis and reduces inflammation through its interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases of the TAM family: Tyro3, Axl, and Mer. Here, we found that plasma concentrations of Gas6 and soluble Mer were greater in patients with severe sepsis or septic ALI/ARDS compared with those in normal healthy donors. To determine whether the Gas6-Mer axis was critical in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS, we investigated the effects of intravenous administration of the selective Mer inhibitor UNC2250 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mouse models subjected to inhalation of LPS. UNC2250 markedly inhibited the infiltration into the lungs of neutrophils and monocytes with increased amounts of Gas6 and Mer proteins, severe lung damage, and increased amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in LPS-induced ALI in mice. In human pulmonary aortic endothelial cells, LPS induced decreases in the amounts of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, thrombomodulin, and vascular endothelial-cadherin, which was blocked by treatment with UNC2250. UNC2250 also inhibited the LPS-dependent increases in cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, a human neutrophil-like cell line, and RAW264.7 cells, a mouse monocyte/macrophage cell line. These data provide insights into the potential multiple beneficial effects of the Mer inhibitor UNC2250 as a therapeutic reagent to treat inflammatory responses in ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ubiquitin ligase E3 HUWE1/MULE targets transferrin receptor for degradation and suppresses ferroptosis in acute liver injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35260822/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatic ischemia followed by reperfusion (I/R), a major clinical problem during liver surgical procedures, can induce liver injury with severe cell death including ferroptosis which is characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxidation. The HECT domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase HUWE1 (also known as MULE) was initially shown to promote apoptosis. However, our preliminary study demonstrates that high expression of HUWE1 in the liver donors corelates with less injury and better hepatic function after liver transplantation in patients. Thus, we investigate the role of HUWE1 in acute liver injury, and identify HUWE1 as a negative ferroptosis modulator through transferrin receptor 1(TfR1). Deficiency of Huwe1 in mice hepatocytes (HKO) exacerbated I/R and CCl4-induced liver injury with more ferroptosis occurrence. Moreover, Suppression of Huwe1 remarkably enhances cellular sensitivity to ferroptosis in primary hepatocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Mechanistically, HUWE1 specifically targets TfR1 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby regulates iron metabolism. Importantly, chemical and genetic inhibition of TfR1 dramatically diminishes the ferroptotic cell death in Huwe1 KO cells and Huwe1 HKO mice. Therefore, HUWE1 is a potential protective factor to antagonize both aberrant iron accumulation and ferroptosis thereby mitigating acute liver injury. These findings may provide clinical implications for patients with the high-expression Huwe1 alleles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Itaconate inhibits TET DNA dioxygenases to dampen inflammatory responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35256775/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the most induced genes in activated macrophages, immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) encodes a mitochondrial metabolic enzyme catalysing the production of itaconic acid (ITA). Although ITA has an anti-inflammatory property, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we show that ITA is a potent inhibitor of the TET-family DNA dioxygenases. ITA binds to the same site on TET2 as the co-substrate α-ketoglutarate, inhibiting TET2 catalytic activity. Lipopolysaccharide treatment, which induces Irg1 expression and ITA accumulation, inhibits Tet activity in macrophages. Transcriptome analysis reveals that TET2 is a major target of ITA in suppressing lipopolysaccharide-induced genes, including those regulated by the NF-κB and STAT signalling pathways. In vivo, ITA decreases the levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced acute pulmonary oedema as well as lung and liver injury, and protects mice against lethal endotoxaemia, depending on the catalytic activity of Tet2. Our study thus identifies ITA as an immune modulatory metabolite that selectively inhibits TET enzymes to dampen the inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interstitial pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage in domestic animals</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35253541/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classification of pneumonia in animals has been controversial, and the most problematic pattern is interstitial pneumonia. This is true from the gross and histologic perspectives, and also from a mechanistic point of view. Multiple infectious and noninfectious diseases are associated with interstitial pneumonia, all of them converging in the release of inflammatory mediators that generate local damage and attract inflammatory cells that inevitably trigger a second wave of damage. Diffuse alveolar damage is one of the more frequently identified histologic types of interstitial pneumonia and involves injury to alveolar epithelial and/or endothelial cells, with 3 distinct stages. The first is the &amp;ldquo;exudative&amp;rdquo; stage, with alveolar edema and hyaline membranes. The second is the &amp;ldquo;proliferative&amp;rdquo; stage, with hyperplasia and reactive atypia of type II pneumocytes, infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages in the interstitium and early proliferation of fibroblasts. These stages are reversible and often nonfatal. If damage persists, there is a third &amp;ldquo;fibrosing&amp;rdquo; stage, characterized by fibrosis of the interstitium due to proliferation of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, persistence of type II pneumocytes, segments of squamous metaplasia of alveolar epithelium, plus inflammation. Understanding the lesion patterns associated with interstitial pneumonias, their causes, and the underlying mechanisms aid in accurate diagnosis that involves an interdisciplinary collaborative approach involving pathologists, clinicians, and radiologists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comparative Effects of Bone Marrow-derived Versus Umbilical Cord Tissue Mesenchymal Stem Cells in an Experimental Model of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35298658/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a life-threatening condition in preterm infants with few effective therapies. Mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising therapeutic strategy for BPD. The ideal MSC source for BPD prevention is however unknown. The objective of this study was to compare the regenerative effects of MSC obtained from bone marrow (BM) and umbilical cord tissue (UCT) in an experimental BPD model. In vitro, UCT-MSC demonstrated greater proliferation and expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines as compared to BM-MSC. Lung epithelial cells incubated with UCT-MSC conditioned media (CM) had better-wound healing following scratch injury. UCT-MSC CM and BM-MSC CM had similar pro-angiogenic effects on hyperoxia-exposed pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. In vivo, newborn rats exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (85% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from postnatal day (P) 1 to 21 were given intra-tracheal (IT) BM or UCT-MSC (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6，、 cells/50 μL), or placebo (PL) on P3. Hyperoxia PL-treated rats had marked alveolar simplification, reduced lung vascular density, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and lung inflammation. In contrast, administration of both BM-MSC and UCT-MSC significantly improved alveolar structure, lung angiogenesis, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and lung inflammation. UCT-MSC hyperoxia-exposed rats however had greater improvement in some morphometric measures of alveolarization and less lung macrophage infiltration as compared to the BM-MSC-treated group. Together, these findings suggest that BM-MSC and UCT-MSC have significant lung regenerative effects in experimental BPD but UCT-MSC suppresses lung macrophage infiltration and promotes lung epithelial cell healing to a greater degree.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pulmonary and Critical Care Considerations for e-Cigarette, or Vaping, Product Use-Associated Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35257738/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In 2019, the United States experienced a nationwide outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). More than one-half of these patients required admission to an ICU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Research question:&lt;/em&gt; What are the recent literature and expert opinions which inform the diagnosis and management of patients with critical illness with EVALI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design and methods:&lt;/em&gt; To synthesize information critical to pulmonary/critical care specialists in the care of patients with EVALI, this study examined data available from patients hospitalized with EVALI between August 2019 and January 2020; reviewed the clinical course and critical care experience with those patients admitted to the ICU; and compiled opinion of national experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Of the 2,708 patients with confirmed or probable EVALI requiring hospitalization as of January 21, 2020, a total of 1,604 (59.2%) had data available on ICU admission; of these, 705 (44.0%) were admitted to the ICU and are included in this analysis. The majority of ICU patients required respiratory support (88.5%) and in severe cases required intubation (36.1%) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (6.7%). The majority (93.0%) of these ICU patients survived to discharge. Review of the clinical course and expert opinion provided insight into: imaging; considerations for bronchoscopy; medical treatment, including use of empiric antibiotics, antiviral agents, and corticosteroids; respiratory support, including considerations for intubation, positioning maneuvers, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; and patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/em&gt; Review of the clinical course of patients with EVALI requiring ICU admission and compilation of expert opinion provided critical insight into pulmonary/critical care-specific considerations for this patient population. Because a large proportion of patients hospitalized with EVALI required ICU admission, it is important to remain prepared to care for patients with EVALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular system that routes distinct cytoplasmic cargo to lysosomes for degradation and recycling. Accumulating evidence highlight the mechanisms of autophagy, such as clearance of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and damaged organelles. The critical role of autophagy in selective degradation of the transcriptome is still emerging and could shape the total proteome of the cell, and thus can regulate the homeostasis under stressful conditions. Unregulated autophagy that potentiates secondary brain damage is a key pathological features of acute CNS injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. This review discussed the mutual modulation of autophagy and RNA and its significance in mediating the functional consequences of acute CNS injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insight into urban PM2.5 chemical composition and environmentally persistent free radicals attributed human lung epithelial cytotoxicity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; pollution in typical urban area is accompanied by the associated EPFRs exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overall exposure risk of bulk PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is related to both aerosol level and compositions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; loaded EPFRs were significantly positively correlated with metallic elements and carbon fractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airborne EPFRs, organic carbon, and heavy metals may be pivotal cytotoxic components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cytotoxicity and pollution of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and EPFRs are higher in cold than warm season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) is detrimental to the human respiratory system. However, the toxicity of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and its associated potentially harmful species, notably novel pollutants like environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), remains unclear. Therefore, one-year site monitoring and ambient air PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; sampling in the Nanjing urban area was designed to investigate the relationships between chemical compositions (carbon fractions, metallic elements, and water-soluble ions) and EPFRs, and change in cytotoxicity with varying PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; components. Oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species, ROS), inflammatory injury (IL-6 and TNF-α), and membrane injury (LDH) of human lung epithelial cells (A549) induced by PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; were analyzed using in vitro cytotoxicity test. Both the composition and toxicity of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; from different seasons were compared. The average daily exposure of urban PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; associated EPFRs load in Nanjing were 2.29 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; spin m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. Their exposure concentration and cytotoxic damage ability were stronger in the cold season than warm. The particle compositions of metals and carbon fractions were significantly positively correlated with EPFRs. The airborne EPFRs, organic carbon (OC), and heavy metal Cu, As, and Pb may pose principal cell damage ability, which is worthy of further study interlinking aerosol pollution and health risks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Osteopontin aggravates acute lung injury in influenza virus infection by promoting macrophages necroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35246529/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) can trigger pulmonary inflammation and lung damage. Osteopontin (OPN) is an essential regulator of cell death and immunity. However, the role and underlying mechanism of OPN in cell death in IAV-induced pulmonary injury remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that OPN-deficient (OPN-/-) mice were insensitive to IAV, exhibiting decreased viral loads and attenuated lung injury after IAV infection compared to those in wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, macrophage necroptosis was significantly reduced in OPN-/- mice infected with IAV compared to that in infected WT mice. OPN increased the expression of necroptosis-related genes and exacerbated macrophage necroptosis in IAV-infected THP1 cells. Notably, adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or OPN-/- BMDMs into mice restored resistance to influenza infection, and the rescue effect of OPN-/- BMDMs was better than that of WT BMDMs. Collectively, these results suggest that OPN deficiency in macrophages reduces necroptosis, which leads to a decrease in viral titers and protects against IAV infection. Therefore, OPN is a potential target for the treatment of IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The inhibition effects and mechanisms of sulfated chitooligosaccharides on influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfated chitooligosaccharide was reported to possess inhibition effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry into host cells. Herein, we prepared chitooligosaccharide COS and its sulfate derivative SCOS and explored whether the sulfation modification can enhance the anti-influenza A virus (IAV) activity of COS. Interestingly, we discovered that SCOS possessed broad-spectrum anti-IAV effects with low toxicity, while the non-sulfated chitooligosaccharide COS had very low inhibition on IAV, verifying that the sulfation modification is essential for the anti-IAV actions of chitooligosaccharide. SCOS may target virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein to block both virus adsorption and membrane fusion processes. Oral administration of SCOS significantly decreased pulmonary viral titers and improved survival rate in IAV infected mice, comparable to the effects of Oseltamivir. Therefore, our findings support further studies on the use of SCOS as a novel entry inhibitor for IAV and as a supplement to current therapeutics for influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acute lung inflammation induced by zinc oxide nanoparticles: Evolution and intervention via NRF2 activator</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35247504/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) are widely used worldwide. Human inhalation exposure to ZnONPs induces acute lung inflammation (ALI); however, the characteristics and therapeutic targets of ALI are unclear. In this study, female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a single intratracheal instillation of 20 μg of ZnONPs. Increased lung malondialdehyde levels and decreased total antioxidant capacity at 6 h, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at 1 day (d) post treatment were observed. A significant inflammatory response was observed at 3 d and 7 d, as evidenced by increased leukocyte numbers and total protein concentration in BALF, and histological abnormalities. Pulmonary NRF2 signaling was significantly activated at 3 d post treatment. To investigate a protective role of NRF2 activator against ZnONP-induced ALI, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-imidazolide (CDDO-Im) (2 mg/kg) 1 d before and 1 d after ZnONPs treatment. CDDO-Im significantly decreased leukocyte numbers and total protein concentration in BALF and pulmonary inflammatory gene expression, and ameliorated histopathological abnormalities induced by ZnONPs. Collectively, the present study indicates that ZnONPs exposure leads to oxidative stress, cell injury and inflammation in the lung successively. Moreover, the NRF2 activator protects against ZnONPs-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modeling injury and repair in kidney organoids reveals that homologous recombination governs tubular intrinsic repair</title>

&lt;p&gt;Erratum for the Research Article, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.add0524&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modeling injury and repair in kidney organoids reveals that homologous recombination governs tubular intrinsic repair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by N. Gupta et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidneys have the capacity for intrinsic repair, preserving kidney architecture with return to a basal state after tubular injury. When injury is overwhelming or repetitive, however, that capacity is exceeded and incomplete repair results in fibrotic tissue replacing normal kidney parenchyma. Loss of nephrons correlates with reduced kidney function, which defines chronic kidney disease (CKD) and confers substantial morbidity and mortality to the worldwide population. Despite the identification of pathways involved in intrinsic repair, limited treatments for CKD exist, partly because of the limited throughput and predictivity of animal studies. Here, we showed that kidney organoids can model the transition from intrinsic to incomplete repair. Single-nuclear RNA sequencing of kidney organoids after cisplatin exposure identified 159 differentially expressed genes and 29 signal pathways in tubular cells undergoing intrinsic repair. Homology-directed repair (HDR) genes including Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (&lt;em&gt;FANCD2&lt;/em&gt;) and RAD51 recombinase (&lt;em&gt;RAD51&lt;/em&gt;) were transiently up-regulated during intrinsic repair but were down-regulated in incomplete repair. Single cellular transcriptomics in mouse models of obstructive and hemodynamic kidney injury and human kidney samples of immune-mediated injury validated HDR gene up-regulation during tubular repair. Kidney biopsy samples with tubular injury and varying degrees of fibrosis confirmed loss of FANCD2 during incomplete repair. Last, we performed targeted drug screening that identified the DNA ligase IV inhibitor, SCR7, as a therapeutic candidate that rescued FANCD2/RAD51-mediated repair to prevent the progression of CKD in the cisplatin-induced organoid injury model. Our findings demonstrate the translational utility of kidney organoids to identify pathologic pathways and potential therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interferon-γ promotes monocyte-mediated lung injury during influenza infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35235782/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are primary contributors to pathologic IFN-γ response during IAV infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-γ regulates the pathologic phenotype of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes during IAV infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-γ deficiency mitigates IAV-mediated lung injury and improves barrier integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-γ is dispensable to IAV clearance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infection triggers an exuberant host response that promotes acute lung injury. However, the host response factors that promote the development of a pathologic inflammatory response to IAV remain incompletely understood. In this study, we identify an interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-regulated subset of monocytes, CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes, as a driver of lung damage during IAV infection. IFN-γ regulates the recruitment and inflammatory phenotype of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes, and mice deficient in CCR2 (CCR2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) or IFN-γ (IFN-γ&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) exhibit reduced lung inflammation, pathology, and disease severity. Adoptive transfer of wild-type (WT) (IFN-γR1&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;) but not IFN-γR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes restore the WT-like pathological phenotype of lung damage in IAV-infected CCR2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are the main source of IFN-γ in IAV-infected lungs. Collectively, our data highlight the requirement of IFN-γ signaling in the regulation of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocyte-mediated lung pathology during IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Candidate Biomarkers for Sepsis-Associated Acute Kidney Injury Mechanistic Studies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35234208/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a frequent complication of sepsis, yet the pathophysiologic mechanisms of SA-AKI are incompletely understood. PERSEVERE is a clinically validated serum biomarker panel with high sensitivity in predicting mortality from sepsis, and recent evidence suggests it can also predict severe, persistent SA-AKI at day 3 of hospitalization among septic children. We developed a murine model of PERSEVERE (mPERSEVERE) to further interrogate the sepsis-related biological underpinnings of SA-AKI using candidate biomarkers within mPERSEVERE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Eight-week-old C57BL/6 male mice underwent induction of sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). mPERSEVERE biomarkers were collected at 8-hours and kidneys were harvested at 24-hours post-CLP Classification and regression tree analysis (CART) was used to generate a SA-AKI predictive model. Kidney gene expression levels of candidate biomarkers were quantified using real time polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Thirty- five mice underwent CLP Among mice identified by mPERSEVERE as high-risk for mortality, 70% developed SA-AKI at 24-hours compared to 22% of low-risk mice. CART analysis identified two mPERSEVERE biomarkers-C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC)-as most predictive for SA-AKI with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.90. In mice that developed SA-AKI, renal expression of KC was significantly increased compared to mice without SA-AKI (p = 0.013), whereas no difference was seen in renal expression of CCL3 in mice with SA-AKI vs. no SA-AKI. KC and CCL3 localized to renal tubule epithelial cells as opposed to infiltrating immune cells by immunohistochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The combination of plasma CCL3+KC can predict SA-AKI development in mice at 24-hours following CLP Of these two biomarkers, only renal expression of KC is increased in mice with SA-AKI. Further studies are required to determine if KC directly contributes to the underlying pathobiology of SA-AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a public health emergency of international concerns. Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is a critical clinical symptom of severe COVID-19 patients, and the macrophage is recognized as the direct host cell of SARS-CoV-2 and potential drivers of CSS. In the present study, peramivir was identified to reduce TNF-α by partly intervention of NF-κB activity in LPS-induced macrophage model. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, peramivir reduced the multi-cytokines in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), alleviated the acute lung injury and prolonged the survival time in mice. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs), peramivir could also inhibit the release of TNF-α. Collectively, we proposed that peramivir might be a candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 and other infections related CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predictors of mortality in subjects with progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35224814/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and objective:&lt;/em&gt; Demographic and clinical variables, measured at baseline or over time, have been associated with mortality in subjects with progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). We used data from the INPULSIS trials in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and the INBUILD trial in subjects with other progressive fibrosing ILDs to assess relationships between demographic/clinical variables and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The relationships between baseline variables and time-varying covariates and time to death over 52 weeks were analysed using pooled data from the INPULSIS trials and, separately, the INBUILD trial using a Cox proportional hazards model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Over 52 weeks, 68/1061 (6.4%) and 33/663 (5.0%) subjects died in the INPULSIS and INBUILD trials, respectively. In the INPULSIS trials, a relative decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) &amp;gt;10% predicted within 12 months (hazard ratio [HR] 3.77) and age (HR 1.03 per 1-year increase) were associated with increased risk of mortality, while baseline FVC % predicted (HR 0.97 per 1-unit increase) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) % predicted (HR 0.77 per 1-unit increase) were associated with lower risk. In the INBUILD trial, a relative decline in FVC &amp;gt;10% predicted within 12 months (HR 2.60) and a usual interstitial pneumonia-like fibrotic pattern on HRCT (HR 2.98) were associated with increased risk of mortality, while baseline DLCO % predicted (HR 0.95 per 1-unit increase) was associated with lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These data support similarity in the course of lung injury between IPF and other progressive fibrosing ILDs and the value of FVC decline as a predictor of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amelioration of Endotoxin-Induced Acute Lung Injury and Alveolar Epithelial Cells Apoptosis by Simvastatin Is Associated with Up-Regulation of Survivin/NF-kB/p65 Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35269738/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disruption of the alveolar-endothelial barrier caused by inflammation leads to the progression of septic acute lung injury (ALI). In the present study, we investigated the beneficial effects of simvastatin on the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and its related mechanisms. A model of ALI was induced within experimental sepsis developed by intraperitoneal injection of a single non-lethal LPS dose after short-term simvastatin pretreatment (10-40 mg/kg orally). The severity of the lung tissue inflammatory injury was expressed as pulmonary damage scores (PDS). Alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL assay (DNA fragmentation) and expressed as an apoptotic index (AI), and immunohistochemically for cleaved caspase-3, cytochrome C, and anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, an inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin, and transcriptional factor, NF-kB/p65. Severe inflammatory injury of pulmonary parenchyma (PDS 3.33 ± 0.48) was developed after the LPS challenge, whereas simvastatin significantly and dose-dependently protected lung histology after LPS (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Simvastatin in a dose of 40 mg/kg showed the most significant effects in amelioration alveolar epithelial cells apoptosis, demonstrating this as a marked decrease of AI (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01 vs. LPS), cytochrome C, and cleaved caspase-3 expression. Furthermore, simvastatin significantly enhanced the expression of Bcl-xL and survivin. Finally, the expression of survivin and its regulator NF-kB/p65 in the alveolar epithelium was in strong positive correlation across the groups. Simvastatin could play a protective role against LPS-induced ALI and apoptosis of the alveolar-endothelial barrier. Taken together, these effects were seemingly mediated by inhibition of caspase 3 and cytochrome C, a finding that might be associated with the up-regulation of cell-survival survivin/NF-kB/p65 pathway and Bcl-xL.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Piperazine ferulate attenuates gentamicin-induced acute kidney injury via the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35286937/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Piperazine ferulate (PF) is widely used in chronic nephritis and nephrotic syndrome in clinic. PF can improve diseases related inflammation by inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signal. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is usually associated with the occurrence and development of renal inflammation. However, the nephroprotective effect and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of PF on AKI are not clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to investigate the nephroprotective effects of PF on gentamicin (GM) induced AKI in rats and its potential mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were intraperitoneally injected with GM (100 mg/kg/day) with or without PF (50 and 100 mg/kg/day) for 7 consecutive days. In vitro, the NRK-52e cells were exposed to GM (7 mg/ml) with or without PF (62.5 μg/ml) treatment. The renal injury and cell damage were assessed subsequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings showed that PF treatment can significantly improve renal function, reduce renal pathological changes, and attenuate inflammatory response in rats treated with gentamicin. Besides, PF could significantly reduce the cell damage and cellular inflammatory response. In terms of mechanisms, our study revealed that PF can evidently inhibit the activation of NF-κB and nod-like receptor family pyrin domain protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Meanwhile, it could down regulate the expressions of protein and gene of p-IKKα, p-IKKβ, p-p65, p65, p50, p105, NLRP3 and IL-1β.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings showed that PF may improve inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway, so as to attenuate AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intestinal microbiota disorders can aggravate pulmonary inflammation during acute lung injury (ALI). As a traditional Chinese herb, Rhubarb can regulated the gut microbiota. Therefore, this study was conducted to test the hypothesis that rhubarb alleviates gut microbiota dysbiosis and inflammation. Feces were collected from patients with ALI to detect the gut microbiota using 16S rDNA sequencing. Subsequently, a mouse model of ALI was established using lipopolysaccharide to investigate changes in the gut microbiota, the peripheral blood was attained for detecting the Th17/Treg cell ratio and the serum level of HDAC6 and HDAC9, and the effect of rhubarb treatment on the gut microbiota and Th17/Treg ratio were also evaluated. The results indicated that both the Firmicutes phylum decreased and the Bacteroidetes phylum increased were identified in patients with ALI, which induced the alternation of histone metabolites. The mice models also showed a similar imbalance in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio at phylum of level. Rhubarb treatment alleviated the damaged lung tissue, accelerated Alistipes, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus proliferation at the level of genus, increased the level of HDAC6 in both the mice lung tissue and serum, and markedly reduced the Treg cells and increased the Th17 cells in the spleen tissue. The study suggested that both patients and mouse models with ALI presented gut microbiota dysbiosis, and lead to a Th17/Treg cell imbalance in ALI mouse. Rhubarb promoted Alistipes, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus proliferation, increased the HDAC6 concentration, restored the Th17/Treg cell balance, and protected against ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An mTOR siRNA-Loaded Spermidine/DNA Tetrahedron Nanoplatform with a Synergistic Anti-Inflammatory Effect on Acute Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by severe inflammation and damage to the lung air-blood barrier, resulting in respiratory function damage and life-threatening outcomes. Macrophage polarization plays an essential role in the occurrence, development, and outcome of ALI. As drug carriers, self-assembled DNA nanostructures can potentially overcome the drawbacks and limitations of traditional anti-inflammatory agents owing to their nontoxicity, programmability, and excellent structural control at the nanoscale. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) and drug dual therapy nanoplatform are proposed and constructed here to combat ALI. The nanoplatform consists of a spermidine-assembled DNA tetrahedron and four mammalian target of rapamycin siRNAs. Spermidine serves as a mediator of drug delivery vehicle synthesis and a drug that alters macrophage polarization. Both spermidine and siRNA exert anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo by regulating the macrophage phenotype. More importantly, these factors exhibit a synergistic anti-inflammatory effect by promoting macrophage autophagy. For the first time, an anti-inflammatory dual therapy strategy that uses self-assembled DNA nanostructures as nontoxic, programmable delivery vehicles is proposed and demonstrated through this work. Future work on utilizing DNA nanostructures for the treatment of noncancerous diseases such as ALI is highly promising and desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue injury can drive secondary organ injury; however, mechanisms and mediators are not well understood. To identify interorgan cross-talk mediators, we used acute kidney injury (AKI)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) as a clinically important example. Using kidney and lung single-cell RNA sequencing after AKI in mice followed by ligand-receptor pairing analysis across organs, kidney ligands to lung receptors, we identify kidney-released circulating osteopontin (OPN) as a novel AKI-ALI mediator. OPN release from kidney tubule cells triggered lung endothelial leakage, inflammation, and respiratory failure. Pharmacological or genetic OPN inhibition prevented AKI-ALI. Transplantation of ischemic wt kidneys caused AKI-ALI, but not of ischemic OPN-global knockout kidneys, identifying kidney-released OPN as necessary interorgan signal to cause AKI-ALI. We show that OPN serum levels are elevated in patients with AKI and correlate with kidney injury. Our results demonstrate feasibility of using ligand-receptor analysis across organs to identify interorgan cross-talk mediators and may have important therapeutic implications in human AKI-ALI and multiorgan failure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung Injury Induces Alveolar Type 2 Cell Hypertrophy and Polyploidy with Implications for Repair and Regeneration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epithelial polyploidization after injury is a conserved phenomenon recently shown to improve barrier restoration during wound healing. Whether lung injury can induce alveolar epithelial polyploidy is not known. We show that bleomycin injury induces alveolar type 2 cell (AT2) hypertrophy and polyploidy. AT2 polyploidization is also seen in short term ex vivo cultures, where AT2-to-AT1 transdifferentiation is associated with substantial binucleation due to failed cytokinesis. Both hypertrophic and polyploid features of AT2 cells can be attenuated by inhibiting the integrated stress response using the small molecule ISRIB. These data suggest that AT2 hypertrophic growth and polyploidization may be a feature of alveolar epithelial injury. Because AT2 cells serve as facultative progenitors for the distal lung epithelium, a propensity for injury-induced binucleation has implications for AT2 self-renewal and regenerative potential upon reinjury, which may benefit from targeting the integrated stress response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MG53 attenuates nitrogen mustard-induced acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen mustard (NM) is an alkylating vesicant that causes severe pulmonary injury. Currently, there are no effective means to counteract vesicant-induced lung injury. MG53 is a vital component of cell membrane repair and lung protection. Here, we show that mice with ablation of MG53 are more susceptible to NM-induced lung injury than the wild-type mice. Treatment of wild-type mice with exogenous recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) protein ameliorates NM-induced lung injury by restoring arterial blood oxygen level, by improving dynamic lung compliance and by reducing airway resistance. Exposure of lung epithelial and endothelial cells to NM leads to intracellular oxidative stress that compromises the intrinsic cell membrane repair function of MG53. Exogenous rhMG53 protein applied to the culture medium protects lung epithelial and endothelial cells from NM-induced membrane injury and oxidative stress, and enhances survival of the cells. Additionally, we show that loss of MG53 leads to increased vulnerability of macrophages to vesicant-induced cell death. Overall, these findings support the therapeutic potential of rhMG53 to counteract vesicant-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tunicamycin Protects against LPS-Induced Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pulmonary endothelium is a dynamic semipermeable barrier that orchestrates tissue-fluid homeostasis; regulating physiological and immunological responses. Endothelial abnormalities are caused by inflammatory stimuli interacting with intracellular messengers to remodel cytoskeletal junctions and adhesion proteins. Those phenomena are associated with sepsis, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The molecular processes beyond those responses are the main interest of our group. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a highly conserved molecular pathway resolving protein-folding defects to counteract cellular threats. An emerging body of evidence suggests that UPR is a promising target against lung and cardiovascular disease. In the present study, we reveal that Tunicamycin (TM) (UPR inducer) protects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury. The barrier function of the inflamed endothelium was evaluated in vitro (transendothelial and paracellular permeability); as well as in mice exposed to TM after LPS. Our study demonstrates that TM supports vascular barrier function by modulating actomyosin remodeling. Moreover, it reduces the internalization of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), enhancing endothelial integrity. We suggest that UPR activation may deliver novel therapeutic opportunities in diseases related to endothelial dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chicoric Acid Attenuated Renal Tubular Injury in HFD-Induced Chronic Kidney Disease Mice through the Promotion of Mitophagy via the Nrf2/PINK/Parkin Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35195395/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the main factor in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the excessive apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) and its underlying mechanism of action are worth further investigation. Chicoric acid (CA), a major active constituent of the Uyghur folk medicine chicory, was recorded to possess a renal protective effect. The precise effect of CA on renal tubular injury in obesity-related CKD remains unknown. In the current study, CA was proven to ameliorate metabolic disorders including overweight, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemia in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Furthermore, the reverse effect of CA on renal histological changes and functional damage was confirmed. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, the alleviation of lipid accumulation and cell apoptosis was observed in palmitic acid (PA)-exposed HK2 cells. Treatment with CA reduced mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress in the renal tubule of HFD-fed mice and PA-treated HK2 cells. Finally, CA was observed to activate the Nrf2 pathway; increase PINK and Parkin expression; and regulate LC3, SQSTM1, Mfn2, and FIS1 expression; therefore, it would improve mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy to alleviate mitochondrial damage in RTECs of obesity-related CKD. These results may provide fresh insights into the promotion of mitophagy in the prevention and alleviation of obesity-related CKD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effect of lung pericyte-like cell ablation on the bleomycin model of injury and repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35196901/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We previously showed that pericyte-like cells derived from the FoxD1-lineage contribute to myofibroblasts following bleomycin-induced lung injury. However, their functional significance in lung fibrosis remains unknown. In this study, we used a model of lung pericyte-like cell ablation to test the hypothesis that pericyte-like cell ablation attenuates lung fibrosis in bleomycin-induced lung injury. Lung fibrosis was induced by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. To ablate pericyte-like cells in the lung, diphtheria toxin (DT) was administered to &lt;em&gt;Foxd1-Cre&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Rosa26-iDTR&lt;/em&gt; mice at two different phases of bleomycin-induced lung injury. For early ablation, we coadministered bleomycin with DT and harvested mice at days 7 and 21. To test the effect of ablation after acute injury, we delivered DT 7 days after bleomycin administration. We assessed fibrosis by lung hydroxyproline content and semiquantitative analysis of picrosirius red staining. We performed bronchoalveolar lavage to determine cell count and differential. We also interrogated mRNA expression of fibrosis-related genes in whole lung RNA. Compared with DT-insensitive littermates where pericyte-like cells were not ablated, DT-sensitive animals exhibited no difference in fibrosis at day 21 both in the early and late pericyte ablation models. However, early ablation of pericytes reduced acute lung inflammation, as indicated by decreased inflammatory cells. Our data confirm a role for pericytes in regulating pulmonary inflammation in early lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loss of legumain induces premature senescence and mediates aging-related renal fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35195326/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging is an independent risk factor for acute kidney injury and subsequent chronic kidney diseases, while the underlying mechanism is still elusive. Here, we found that renal tubules highly express a conserved lysosomal endopeptidase, legumain, which is significantly downregulated with the growing of age. Tubule-specific legumain-knockout mice exhibit spontaneous renal interstitial fibrosis from the 3rd month. In the tubule-specific legumain-knockout mice and the cultured legumain-knockdown HK-2 cells, legumain deficiency induces the activation of tubular senescence and thus increases the secretion of profibrotic senescence-associated cytokines, which in turn accelerates the activation of fibroblasts. Blockage of senescence mitigates the fibrotic lesion caused by legumain deficiency. Mechanistically, we found that silencing down of legumain leads to the elevated lysosome pH value, enlargement of lysosome size, and increase of lysosomal voltage dependent membrane channel proteins. Either legumain downregulation or aging alone induces the activation of nuclear transcription factors EB (TFEB) while it fails to further upregulate in the elderly legumain-knockdown tubules, accompanied with impaired mitophagy and increased mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) accumulation. Therapeutically, supplementation of exosomal legumain ameliorated fibronectin and collagen I production in an in vitro coculture system of tubular cells and fibroblasts. Altogether, our data demonstrate that loss of legumain in combined with aging dysregulates lysosomal homeostasis, although either aging or legumain deficiency alone induces lysosome adaptation via stimulating lysosomal biogenesis. Consequently, impaired mitophagy leads to mtROS accumulation and therefore activates tubular senescence and boosts the interstitial fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil extracellular traps in chronic lung disease: implications for pathogenesis and therapy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophilic inflammation has a key role in the pathophysiology of multiple chronic lung diseases. The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has emerged as a key mechanism of disease in neutrophilic lung diseases including asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis and, most recently, bronchiectasis. NETs are large, web-like structures composed of DNA and anti-microbial proteins that are able to bind pathogens, prevent microbial dissemination and degrade bacterial virulence factors. The release of excess concentrations of proteases, antimicrobial proteins, DNA and histones, however, also leads to tissue damage, impaired mucociliary clearance, impaired bacterial killing and increased inflammation. A number of studies have linked airway NET formation with greater disease severity, increased exacerbations and overall worse disease outcomes across the spectrum of airway diseases. Treating neutrophilic inflammation has been challenging in chronic lung disease because of the delicate balance between reducing inflammation and increasing the risk of infections through immunosuppression. Novel approaches to suppressing NET formation or the associated inflammation are in development and represent an important therapeutic target. This review will discuss the relationship between NETs and the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis, asthma, COPD and bronchiectasis, and explore the current and future development of NET-targeting therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phosphoinositide 3 Kinase γ Plays a Critical Role in Acute Kidney Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory cells contribute to the pathogenesis of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). However, the signaling mechanisms underlying the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the kidney are not well understood. In this study, we examined the effects of phosphoinositide 3 kinase γ (PI3Kγ) on inflammatory cells infiltration into the kidney in response to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Compared with wild-type mice, PI3Kγ knockout mice displayed less IRI in the kidney with fewer tubular apoptotic cell. Furthermore, PI3Kγ deficiency decreased the number of infiltrated neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells in the kidney, which was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the kidney. Moreover, wild-type mice treated with AS-605240, a selective PI3Kγ inhibitor, displayed less tubular damage, accumulated fewer inflammatory cells, and expressed less proinflammatory molecules in the kidney following IRI. These results demonstrate that PI3Kγ has a critical role in the pathogenesis of kidney damage in IRI, indicating that PI3Kγ inhibition may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of ischemia-reperfusion-induced kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein-4 promotes renal inflammatory injury in type 2 diabetes mellitus</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35218794/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35218794/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein-4 (RasGRP4) is an activator of Ras protein, which plays significant roles in both the inflammatory response and immune activation. This study determined the role of RasGRP4 in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to establish RasGRP4 knockout (KO) mice. Diabetes was induced by a high-fat diet combined with five consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) in C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice and RasGRP4 KO mice. Hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson&amp;rsquo;s trichrome staining were used to observe the histology of pathological injury. Immunohistochemical staining was used to analyze inflammatory cell infiltration. Quantitative PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of inflammatory mediators and the activation of signaling pathways in renal tissues. In vitro cell co-culture experiments were performed to explore the interactions between peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; RasGRP4 KO mice developed less severe diabetic kidney injury compared to WT mice, exhibiting lower proteinuria, reduced CD3+ T lymphocyte and F4/80+ macrophage infiltration, less inflammatory mediator expression including interleukin 6, tumor necrosis alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and lower expression levels of critical signal transduction molecules in the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 inflammasome and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways in the diabetic kidney. In vitro experiments showed that the adhesion function of PBMCs of RasGRP4 KO mice was reduced compared to that of WT mice. Moreover, the expression of adhesion molecules and critical signal transduction molecules in the NLRP3 inflammasome and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways in GEnCs was stimulated by the supernatant of PBMCs, which were derived from RasGRP4 KO mice treated with high glucose and were also significantly reduced compared to those derived from WT mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; RasGRP4 promotes the inflammatory injury mediated by PBMCs in diabetes, probably by regulating the interaction between PBMCs and GEnCs and further activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Serum Protein Exposure Activates a Core Regulatory Program Driving Human Proximal Tubule Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35197326/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The kidneys efficiently filter waste products while retaining serum proteins in the circulation. However, numerous diseases compromise this barrier function, resulting in spillage of serum proteins into the urine (proteinuria). Some studies of glomerular filtration suggest that tubules may be physiologically exposed to nephrotic-range protein levels. Therefore, whether serum components can directly injure the downstream tubular portions of the kidney, which in turn can lead to inflammation and fibrosis, remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We tested the effects of serum protein exposure in human kidney tubule microphysiologic systems and with orthogonal epigenomic approaches since animal models cannot directly assess the effect of serum components on tubules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Serum, but not its major protein component albumin, induced tubular injury and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Epigenomic comparison of serum-injured tubules and intact kidney tissue revealed canonical stress-inducible regulation of injury-induced genes. Concordant transcriptional changes in microdissected tubulointerstitium were also observed in an independent cohort of patients with proteinuric kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results demonstrate a causal role for serum proteins in tubular injury and identify regulatory mechanisms and novel pathways for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myofibroblast YAP/TAZ activation is a key step in organ fibrogenesis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35191398/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibrotic diseases account for nearly half of all deaths in the developed world. Despite its importance, the pathogenesis of fibrosis remains poorly understood. Recently, the two mechanosensitive transcription cofactors YAP and TAZ have emerged as important profibrotic regulators in multiple murine tissues. Despite this growing recognition, a number of important questions remain unanswered, including which cell types require YAP/TAZ activation for fibrosis to occur and the time course of this activation. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the role that myofibroblast YAP and TAZ play in organ fibrosis and the kinetics of their activation. Using analyses of cells, as well as multiple murine and human tissues, we demonstrated that myofibroblast YAP and TAZ were activated early after organ injury and that this activation was sustained. We further demonstrated the critical importance of myofibroblast YAP/TAZ in driving progressive scarring in the kidney, lung, and liver, using multiple transgenic models in which YAP and TAZ were either deleted or hyperactivated. Taken together, these data establish the importance of early injury-induced myofibroblast YAP and TAZ activation as a key event driving fibrosis in multiple organs. This information should help guide the development of new antifibrotic YAP/TAZ inhibition strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prompt Antiviral Action of Pulmonary CD8&#43; TRM Cells Is Mediated by Rapid IFN-γ Induction and Its Downstream ISGs in the Lung</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35296070/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35296070/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing lines of evidence supported the importance of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; lung tissue resident memory T (T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;) cells in protection against respiratory viruses, exemplified by influenza A virus. However, the underlying &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; mechanism remains largely undetermined. Here, we used mouse infection models to dissect &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; cross-protective activity of lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells. By simultaneously interrogating transcriptional dynamics in lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells and surrounding tissues during the early course of infection, we demonstrated that lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells react to antigen re-exposure within hours, manifested by IFN-γ upregulation, and a tissue-wide interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) program is subsequently elicited. Using antibody-mediated IFN-γ neutralization and IFN-γ receptor knockout mice, we could show that the induction of several important antiviral ISGs required IFN-γ signaling, so did the suppression of key inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, there were also examples of ISGs unaffected in the absence of IFN-γ activity. Collectively, focusing on &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; characterization of lung CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; cells during very early stage of infection, a critical period of host antiviral defense that has been poorly investigated, our studies highlight that these cells, once triggered by antigen re-exposure, are programmed to produce IFN-γ expeditiously to promote a lung-wide antiviral response for effective virus control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tidal Volume-Dependent Activation of the Renin-Angiotensin System in Experimental Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35191411/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35191411/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Mechanical damage to the lungs is potentially aggravated by the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This article describes RAS activation profiles in VILI and discusses the effects of angiotensin (Ang) 1-7 supplementation or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril as protective strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design:&lt;/em&gt; Animal study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting:&lt;/em&gt; University research laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjects:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interventions:&lt;/em&gt; Anesthetized mice ( n = 12-18 per group) were mechanically ventilated with low tidal volume (LV T , 6 mL/kg), high tidal volume (HV T , 15 mL/kg), or very high tidal volume (VHV T , 30 mL/kg) for 4 hours, or killed after 3 minutes (sham). Additional VHV T groups received infusions of 60 μg/kg/hr Ang 1-7 or a single dose of 100 mg/kg captopril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and main results:&lt;/em&gt; VILI was characterized by increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of interleukin (IL)-6, keratinocyte-derived cytokine, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP2). The Ang metabolites in plasma measured with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry showed a strong activation of the classical (Ang I, Ang II) and alternative RAS (Ang 1-7, Ang 1-5), with highest concentrations found in the HV T group. Although the lung-tissue ACE messenger RNA expression was unchanged, its protein expression showed a dose-dependent increase under mechanical ventilation. The ACE2 messenger RNA expression decreased in all ventilated groups, whereas ACE2 protein levels remained unchanged. Both captopril and Ang 1-7 led to markedly increased Ang 1-7 plasma levels, decreased Ang II levels, and ACE activity (Ang II/Ang I ratio), and effectively prevented VILI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; VILI is accompanied by a strong activation of the RAS. Based on circulating Ang metabolite levels and tissue expression of RAS enzymes, classical ACE-dependent and alternative RAS cascades were activated in the HV T group, whereas classical RAS activation prevailed with VHV T ventilation. Ang 1-7 or captopril protected from VILI primarily by modifying the systemic RAS profile.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BCG vaccination provides protection against IAV but not SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35235831/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BCG vaccination provides significant protection against IAV in mice and hamsters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BCG provides no protection against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and hamsters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 induces pulmonary hemorrhage and disseminates to the bone marrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monocytes from BCG-vaccinated humans induce more cytokines to IAV than SARS-CoV-2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the vast majority of species solely rely on innate immunity for host defense, it stands to reason that a critical evolutionary trait like immunological memory evolved in this primitive branch of our immune system. There is ample evidence that vaccines such as bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induce protective innate immune memory responses (trained immunity) against heterologous pathogens. Here we show that while BCG vaccination significantly reduces morbidity and mortality against influenza A virus (IAV), it fails to provide protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In contrast to IAV, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to unique pulmonary vasculature damage facilitating viral dissemination to other organs, including the bone marrow (BM), a central site for BCG-mediated trained immunity. Finally, monocytes from BCG-vaccinated individuals mount an efficient cytokine response to IAV infection, while this response is minimal following SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our data suggest that the protective capacity of BCG vaccination is contingent on viral pathogenesis and tissue tropism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Buformin alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis through an AMPK-dependent pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35132999/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated macrophage pyroptosis plays an important role in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Inhibition of pyroptosis may be a way to alleviate inflammation as well as tissue damage triggered after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The aim of the present study was to explore whether buformin (BF), a hypoglycemic agent, could alleviate sepsis-induced ALI by inhibiting pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Wildtype C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into control group, BF group, LPS group and LPS+BF group. BF group and LPS+BF group were pretreated with BF at a dose of 25 mg/kg, and the changes were observed. In addition, BF was used to interfere with THP-1 cells. The therapeutic effect of BF has been verified by intraperitoneal injection of BF in vivo after LPS stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation and injury was significantly reduced in BF pretreated mice, and the indexes related to pyroptosis were suppressed. The phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in lung tissues of mice in the BF and LPS+BF groups was significantly higher. In THP-1 cells, the AMPK inhibitor, Compound C was added to demonstrate that BF worked via AMPK to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome. It was further demonstrated that BF up-regulated autophagy, which in turn promoted NLRP3 inflammasome degradation. On the other hand, BF decreased NLRP3 mRNA level by increasing nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). And BF showed a therapeutic effect after LPS challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study confirmed that BF inhibited NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in sepsis-induced ALI by up-regulating autophagy and Nrf2 protein level through an AMPK-dependent pathway. This provides a new strategy for clinical mitigation of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are calcium-dependent enzymes that mediate citrullination, an irreversible post-translational modification (PTM). PAD enzymes have received increasing attention in (patho-)physiology since multi-omics analysis accelerated their expression profiling. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of PAD expression at the RNA and protein levels, and a list of annotated substrates per PAD isozyme. We discuss novel roles of citrullination in cellular growth, epigenetic regulation, tissue remodeling, inflammation, and cancer in mouse models and humans. Additionally, we cluster similar effects of protein deimination to offer a different perspective and improve our understanding of citrullination in health and disease. Citrullination should no longer be considered as a rare PTM, but as an important regulatory mechanism in physiology and pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening with downstream activation of mechanosensitive pathways is strongly implicated in fibrosis. We previously reported that altered collagen nanoarchitecture is a key determinant of pathogenetic ECM structure-function in human fibrosis (Jones et al., 2018). Here, through human tissue, bioinformatic and ex vivo studies we provide evidence that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway activation is a critical pathway for this process regardless of the oxygen status (pseudohypoxia). Whilst TGFβ increased the rate of fibrillar collagen synthesis, HIF pathway activation was required to dysregulate post-translational modification of fibrillar collagen, promoting pyridinoline cross-linking, altering collagen nanostructure, and increasing tissue stiffness. In vitro, knockdown of Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH), which modulates HIF activity, or oxidative stress caused pseudohypoxic HIF activation in the normal fibroblasts. By contrast, endogenous FIH activity was reduced in fibroblasts from patients with lung fibrosis in association with significantly increased normoxic HIF pathway activation. In human lung fibrosis tissue, HIF-mediated signalling was increased at sites of active fibrogenesis whilst subpopulations of human lung fibrosis mesenchymal cells had increases in both HIF and oxidative stress scores. Our data demonstrate that oxidative stress can drive pseudohypoxic HIF pathway activation which is a critical regulator of pathogenetic collagen structure-function in fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Puerarin-V prevents the progression of hypoxia- and monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in rodent models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a cardiopulmonary disease characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. One of the initial pathogenic factors of PH is pulmonary arterial remodeling under various stimuli. Current marketed drugs against PH mainly relieve symptoms without significant improvement in overall prognosis. Discovering and developing new therapeutic drugs that interfere with vascular remodeling is in urgent need. Puerarin is an isoflavone compound extracted from the root of Kudzu vine, which is widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of puerarin in the treatment of experimental PH. PH was induced in rats by a single injection of MCT (50 mg/kg, sc), and in mice by exposure to hypoxia (10% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 14 days. After MCT injection the rats were administered puerarin (10, 30, 100 mg·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;·d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.g.) for 28 days, whereas hypoxia-treated mice were pre-administered puerarin (60 mg·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;·d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.g.) for 7 days. We showed that puerarin administration exerted significant protective effects in both experimental PH rodent models, evidenced by significantly reduced right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and lung injury, improved pulmonary artery blood flow as well as pulmonary vasodilation and contraction function, inhibited inflammatory responses in lung tissues, improved resistance to apoptosis and abnormal proliferation in lung tissues, attenuated right ventricular injury and remodeling, and maintained normal function of the right ventricle. We revealed that MCT and hypoxia treatment significantly downregulated BMPR2/Smad signaling in the lung tissues and PPARγ/PI3K/Akt signaling in the lung tissues and right ventricles, which were restored by puerarin administration. In addition, we showed that a novel crystal type V (Puer-V) exerted better therapeutic effects than the crude form of puerarin (Puer). Furthermore, Puer-V was more efficient than bosentan (a positive control drug) in alleviating the abnormal structural changes and dysfunction of lung tissues and right ventricles. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence for developing Puer-V as a novel therapeutic drug to treat PH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Core fucosylation involvement in the paracrine regulation of proteinuria-induced renal interstitial fibrosis evaluated with the use of a microfluidic chip</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35189379/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteinuria is a clinical manifestation of chronic kidney disease that aggravates renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF), in which injury of peritubular microvessels is an important event. However, the changes in peritubular microvessels induced by proteinuria and their molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, we aimed to develop a co-culture microfluidic device that contains renal tubules and peritubular microvessels to create a proteinuria model. We found that protein overload in the renal tubule induced trans-differentiation and apoptosis of endothelial cells (ECs) and pericytes. Moreover, profiling of secreted proteins in this model revealed that a paracrine network between tubules and microvessels was activated in proteinuria-induced microvascular injury. Multiple cytokine receptors in this paracrine network were core-fucosylated. Inhibition of core fucosylation significantly reduced ligand-receptor binding ability and blocked downstream pathways, alleviating trans-differentiation and apoptosis of ECs and pericytes. Furthermore, the protective effect of genetic FUT8 deficiency on proteinuria overload-induced RIF and pericyte-myofibroblast trans-differentiation was validated in FUT8 knockout heterozygous mice. In conclusion, we constructed and used a multiple-unit integrated microfluidic device to uncover the mechanism of proteinuria-induced RIF. Furthermore, FUT8 may serve as a hub-like therapeutic target to alleviate peritubular microvascular injury in RIF. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we constructed a multiple-unit integrated renal tubule-vascular chip. We reproduced human proteinuria on the chip and found that multiple receptors were modified by FUT8-catalyzed core fucosylation (CF) involved in the cross-talk between renal tubules and peritubular microvessels in proteinuria-induced RIF, and inhibiting the FUT8 of receptors could block the tubule-microvessel paracrine network and reverse the damage of peritubular microvessels and renal interstitial fibrosis. This tubule-vascular chip may provide a prospective platform to facilitate future investigations into the mechanisms of kidney diseases, and target-FUT8 inhibition may be an innovative and potential therapeutic strategy for RIF induced by proteinuria.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CRISPR/Cas9-Engineered HLA-Deleted Glomerular Endothelial Cells as a Tool to Predict Pathogenic Non-HLA Antibodies in Kidney Transplant Recipients</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35167486/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; After kidney transplantation, donor-specific antibodies against human leukocyte antigen donor-specific antibodies (HLA-DSAs) drive antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) and are associated with poor transplant outcomes. However, ABMR histology (ABMRh) is increasingly reported in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) without HLA-DSAs, highlighting the emerging role of non-HLA antibodies (Abs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We designed a non-HLA Ab detection immunoassay (NHADIA) using HLA class I and II-deficient glomerular endothelial cells (CiGEnCΔHLA) that had been previously generated through CRISPR/Cas9-induced &lt;em&gt;B2M&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CIITA&lt;/em&gt; gene disruption. Flow cytometry assessed the reactivity to non-HLA antigens of pretransplantation serum samples from 389 consecutive KTRs. The intensity of the signal observed with the NHADIA was associated with post-transplant graft histology assessed in 951 adequate biopsy specimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We sequentially applied CRISPR/Cas9 to delete the &lt;em&gt;B2M&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CIITA&lt;/em&gt; genes to obtain a CiGEnCΔHLA clone. CiGEnCΔHLA cells remained indistinguishable from the parental cell line, CiGEnC, in terms of morphology and phenotype. Previous transplantation was the main determinant of the pretransplantation NHADIA result (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Stratification of 3-month allograft biopsy specimens (n=298) according to pretransplantation NHADIA tertiles demonstrated that higher levels of non-HLA Abs positively correlated with increased glomerulitis (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.002), microvascular inflammation (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.003), and ABMRh (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.03). A pretransplantation NHADIA threshold of 1.87 strongly discriminated the KTRs with the highest risk of ABMRh (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.005, log-rank test). A multivariate Cox model confirmed that NHADIA status and HLA-DSAs were independent, yet synergistic, predictors of ABMRh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The NHADIA identifies non-HLA Abs and strongly predicts graft endothelial injury independent of HLA-DSAs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Alleviate Acute Lung Injury Caused by Severe Burn via Secreting TSG-6 and Inhibiting Inflammatory Response</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate whether hUC-MSCs attenuated severe burn-induced ALI and the effects were based on TSG-6 secreted from hUC-MSCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Method:&lt;/em&gt; A rat model was established and evaluated as follows: cytokine expression was measured by ELISA, and both inflammatory cell infiltration and lung injury were assessed by immunohistochemistry assay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, TSG-6 levels in serum from the burn group were significantly increased compared with those from the sham group. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, TSG-6 levels of lung tissues and serum in the burn+hUC-MSC group were significantly increased compared with those in the burn group. Both in lung tissues and in serum, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) were remarkably decreased, but the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased after hUC-MSC administration (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). These significant positive effects after hUC-MSC transplantation did not occur in the burn+siTSG-6 group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The intratracheal implantation of hUC-MSCs has been an effective treatment for severe burn-induced ALI via promoting TSG-6 secretion and inhibiting inflammatory reaction in lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-17 Receptor C Signaling Controls CD4&#43; TH17 Immune Responses and Tissue Injury in Immune-Mediated Kidney Diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35167487/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; IL-17A-producing CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T helper (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17) cells play a critical role in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, such as crescentic GN. The proinflammatory effects of IL-17 are mediated by the activation of the IL-17RA/IL-17RC complex. Although the expression of these receptors on epithelial and endothelial cells is well characterized, the IL-17 receptor expression pattern and function on hematopoietic cells, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell subsets, remains to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Crescentic GN (nephrotoxic nephritis) was induced in IL-17A, IFNγ, and Foxp3 triple-reporter mice for sorting of renal CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell subsets and subsequent single-cell RNA sequencing. Moreover, we generated T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cell-specific IL-17RA and IL-17RC gene-deficient mice and studied the functional role of IL-17 signaling in T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells in crescentic GN, imiquimod-induced psoriasis, and in the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45RB&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; T cell transfer colitis model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We identified a specific expression of the IL-17 receptor A/C complex on CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing of T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells revealed the activation of the IL-17 receptor signaling pathway in experimental crescentic GN. Disruption of the IL-17RC signaling pathway in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and, most importantly, specifically in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells, potentiates the IL-17 cytokine response and results in an accelerated course of experimental crescentic GN. Comparable results were observed in experimental models of psoriasis and colitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings indicate that IL-17 receptor C signaling has a previously unrecognized function in the regulation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells and in the control of organ-specific autoimmunity and might provide new insights into the development of more efficient anti-T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NR4A1 Promotes LPS-Induced Acute Lung Injury through Inhibition of Opa1-Mediated Mitochondrial Fusion and Activation of PGAM5-Related Necroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35222801/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis have been perceived as the primary molecular mechanisms underscoring acute lung injury. Meanwhile, nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) is considered a regulator of inflammation-related endothelial injury in lung tissue although the downstream molecular events remain elusive. In this study, we employed NR4A1-/- mice to decipher the role of NR4A1 in the onset and progression of acute lung injury with a focus on mitochondrial damage and necroptosis. Our results demonstrated that NR4A1 was significantly upregulated in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) treated lung tissues. Knockout of NR4A1 overtly improved lung tissue morphology, inhibited inflammation, and reduced oxidative stress in LPS-treated lung tissue. A cell signaling study suggested that NR4A1 deletion repressed levels of PGAM5 and attenuated LPS-mediated necroptosis in primary murine alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells, the effects of which were mitigated by PGAM5 overexpression. Moreover, LPS-mediated mitochondrial injury including mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and mitochondrial oxidative stress was drastically improved by NR4A1 deletion. Furthermore, NR4A1 deletion preserved mitochondrial homeostasis through activation of Opa1-related mitochondrial fusion. Silencing of Opa1 triggered mitochondrial dysfunction in NR4A1-deleted ATII cells. Taken together, our data identified NR4A1 as a novel regulator of LPS-related acute lung injury through regulation of mitochondrial fusion and necroptosis, indicating therapeutic promises of targeting NR4A1 in the treatment of acute lung injury in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quercetin-3-Rutinoside alleviates radiation-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis via regulation of NF-κB/TGF-β1 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35219007/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation exposure to lungs during nuclear catastrophes or radiotherapy poses long-term side effects and can induce pulmonary injury sufficient for causing death. The strategies for preventing or reversing radiation-induced lung injuries have not been yet developed. Quercetin-3-Rutinoside (Q-3-R), a polyphenolic bioflavonoid, has shown multifaceted pharmacological applications due to its high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; In the current study, the potential of Q-3-R against radiation-induced lung pneumonitis/fibrosis and the possible underlying mechanism was investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study design: To evaluate the effect of Q-3-R against lung damage, C57Bl/6 mice were administered with Q-3-R (10 mg/kg b.wt.) and irradiated with a single dose of gamma radiation (12 Gy) at thoracic region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; 16 weeks after irradiation lung damage was seen by histopathological studies and staining for collagen deposition. Expression of Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Smad3, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), α-smooth muscle actin protein (α-SMA), Aquaporin 5 (AQP 5), Interleukins (IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and caspase-3 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry/western blot/Elisa. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)/ Nitric oxide (NO) scavenging potential of Q-3-R and inhibition of cell death in irradiated lungs were also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Mice showed signs of pneumonitis and fibrotic changes in lungs following radiation treatment. A dramatic increase in inflammatory cells and cytokines contributing to lung disease pathogenesis was observed. Furthermore, expression of NF-κB, TGF-β1, Smad3, ICAM-1, AQP5and α-SMA was found markedly up-regulated. However, pretreatment of Q-3-R significantly attenuated radiation-induced pneumonitis and fibrosis. Histological examination revealed less structural and fibrotic changes with down-regulation of AQP 5, ICAM-1, α-SMA and caspase-3 in Q-3-R pretreated irradiated groups. The formulation significantly relieved lung injury by suppressing inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines such as IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β1 via inhibition of NF-κB. Q-3-R also curtailed radiation-induced ROS/NO generation and minimized DNA damage in the irradiated lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The findings from the current study clearly demonstrate that Q-3-R provides radioprotection to the lungs by regulating NF-κB/TGF-β1 signaling, scavenging free radicals, preventing perivascular infiltration and prolonged inflammatory cascade which could otherwise lead to chronic radiation fibrosis. Q-3-R can be proved as a potential therapeutic agent for alleviating radiation-induced lung injury in case of planned or unplanned radiation exposure scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Repeated endo-tracheal tube disconnection generates pulmonary edema in a model of volume overload: an experimental study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35180891/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; An abrupt lung deflation in rodents results in lung injury through vascular mechanisms. Ventilator disconnections during endo-tracheal suctioning in humans often cause cardio-respiratory instability. Whether repeated disconnections or lung deflations cause lung injury or oedema is not known and was tested here in a porcine large animal model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Yorkshire pigs (~ 12 weeks) were studied in three series. First, we compared PEEP abruptly deflated from 26 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or from PEEP 5 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to zero. Second, pigs were randomly crossed over to receive rapid versus gradual PEEP removal from 20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Third, pigs with relative volume overload, were ventilated with PEEP 15 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and randomized to repeated ETT disconnections (15 s every 15 min) or no disconnection for 3 h. Hemodynamics, pulmonary variables were monitored, and lung histology and bronchoalveolar lavage studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; As compared to PEEP 5 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, abrupt deflation from PEEP 26 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O increased PVR, lowered oxygenation, and increased lung wet-to-dry ratio. From PEEP 20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, gradual versus abrupt deflation mitigated the changes in oxygenation and vascular resistance. From PEEP 15, repeated disconnections in presence of fluid loading led to reduced compliance, lower oxygenation, higher pulmonary artery pressure, higher lung wet-to-dry ratio, higher lung injury score and increased oedema on morphometry, compared to no disconnects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Single abrupt deflation from high PEEP, and repeated short deflations from moderate PEEP cause pulmonary oedema, impaired oxygenation, and increased PVR, in this large animal model, thus replicating our previous finding from rodents. Rapid deflation may thus be a clinically relevant cause of impaired lung function, which may be attenuated by gradual pressure release.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alveolar crystal burden in stone workers with artificial stone silicosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35176815/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and objective:&lt;/em&gt; An epidemic of silicosis has emerged due to a failure to control risks associated with exposure to high-silica content respirable dust generated while working with artificial stone products. Methods for quantification of alveolar crystal burden are needed to advance our understanding of the pathobiology of silica-related lung injury as well as assisting in the diagnosis, clinical management and prognostication of affected workers. The objective of this study was to develop and validate novel methods to quantify alveolar crystal burden in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with artificial stone silicosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; New methods to quantify and analyse alveolar crystal in BAL from patients with artificial stone silicosis were developed. Crystals were isolated and counted by microscopy and alveolar crystal burden was calculated using a standard curve generated by titration of respirable α-Quartz. The utility of the assay was then assessed in 23 patients with artificial stone silicosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Alveolar crystal burden was greater in patients with silicosis (0.44 picograms [pg]/cell [0.08-3.49]) compared to patients with other respiratory diagnoses (0.057 pg/cell [0.01-0.34]; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Alveolar crystal burden was positively correlated with years of silica exposure (&lt;em&gt;ρ&lt;/em&gt; = 0.49, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02) and with decline in diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (&lt;em&gt;ρ&lt;/em&gt; = -0.50, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Alveolar crystal burden quantification differentiates patients with silicosis from patients with other respiratory disorders. Furthermore, crystal burden is correlated with the rate of decline in lung function in patients with artificial stone silicosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pulmonary and Systemic Toxicity in a Rat Model of Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis Induced by Indium-Tin Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35210771/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; The main objective of this study was to clarify the biodistribution and in vivo toxicological effects of indium-tin oxide nanoparticles (Nano-ITO) in male rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Dose-response (three divided doses) and time-course studies (six exposure durations) were performed to examine Nano‑ITO-induced pulmonary and systemic toxicity. At the end of the experiment, hematology and serum biochemical parameters were determined, and cytokines levels and oxidative stress were analyzed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In addition, indium biodistribution following Nano‑ITO exposure was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer to measure indium concentration in the lung, spleen, brain, liver, kidney, and testis. Rat lung tissues were also harvested for staining with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid Schiff stain, Masson&amp;rsquo;s trichrome, and Sirius red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Relative lung weights were significantly increased in all Nano-ITO-exposed groups. All organs exhibited a statistically significant difference in indium levels. Rat exposure to Nano‑ITO resulted in a dose-response increase in acute systemic inflammation and injury. BALF analysis revealed significantly elevated levels of lung oxidative stress, pulmonary injury, and inflammatory markers across most groups. Serum biochemistry results showed that Nano-ITO could affect the liver and renal functions of rats when exposed for 3 days. Compared with the control group, significant inflammatory responses or pathological changes were observed in the liver, kidney, and testis of rats at different sampling times and three doses examined. Histopathologically, foci of slight-to-severe pulmonary inflammatory response along with acute inflammatory, pulmonary fibrosis and alveolar proteinosis were detected, and the severity of these lesions worsened in a dose- and time-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt; These findings provide novel evidence that enhanced progressive massive pulmonary fibrosis, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, and collagen accumulation play a role in the development of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis following Nano-ITO exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in fine particulate matter-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35182631/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution poses significant health concerns worldwide and can cause respiratory diseases. However, how it causes health problems is still poorly understood. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 is a terminal carboxypeptidase implicated in the functions of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and plays a crucial role in the control of lung inflammation. To investigate whether ACE2 functions in PM2.5-induced lung inflammation, wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice and ACE2 knock-out (KO) mice were intratracheally instilled with PBS or PM2.5 suspension for 3 consecutive days, respectively. The concentrations of cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined by ELISA. The expression of ACE2 and ACE and activation of inflammatory signaling pathways in lung tissues were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting. We found that PM2.5 exposure increased ACE2 expression. Loss of ACE2 significantly elevated the levels of total proteins, total cells, and the concentrations of MCP-1, IL-1β in BALF after PM2.5 challenge. Additionally, loss of ACE2 enhanced lung pathologies, airway resistance, and inflammatory signaling activation. Collectively, loss of ACE2 exacerbates PM2.5-induced acute lung injury in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IRE1α drives lung epithelial progenitor dysfunction to establish a niche for pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35170357/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lung injury, damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs) emerge, representing a transitional state between injured epithelial cells and newly regenerated alveoli. DATPs express profibrotic genes, suggesting that they might promote idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the molecular pathways that induce and/or maintain DATPs are incompletely understood. Here we show that the bifunctional kinase/RNase-IRE1α-a central mediator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a critical promoter of DATP abundance and function. Administration of a nanomolar-potent, monoselective kinase inhibitor of IRE1α (KIRA8)-or conditional epithelial IRE1α gene knockout-both reduce DATP cell number and fibrosis in the bleomycin model, indicating that IRE1α cell-autonomously promotes transition into the DATP state. IRE1α enhances the profibrotic phenotype of DATPs since KIRA8 decreases expression of integrin αvβ6, a key activator of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) in pulmonary fibrosis, corresponding to decreased TGF-β-induced gene expression in the epithelium and decreased collagen accumulation around DATPs. Furthermore, IRE1α regulates DNA damage response (DDR) signaling, previously shown to promote the DATP phenotype, as IRE1α loss-of-function decreases H2AX phosphorylation, Cdkn1a (p21) expression, and DDR-associated secretory gene expression. Finally, KIRA8 treatment increases the differentiation of Krt19CreERT2-lineage-traced DATPs into type 1 alveolar epithelial cells after bleomycin injury, indicating that relief from IRE1α signaling enables DATPs to exit the transitional state. Thus, IRE1α coordinates a network of stress pathways that conspire to entrap injured cells in the DATP state. Pharmacological blockade of IRE1α signaling helps resolve the DATP state, thereby ameliorating fibrosis and promoting salutary lung regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A cortactin CTTN coding SNP contributes to lung vascular permeability and inflammatory disease severity in African descent subjects</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35181549/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cortactin gene (CTTN), encoding an actin-binding protein critically involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity, contains single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with severe asthma in Black patients. As loss of lung EC integrity is a major driver of mortality in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and the acute chest syndrome (ACS), we speculated CTTN SNPs that alter EC barrier function will associate with clinical outcomes from these types of conditions in Black patients. In case-control studies, evaluation of a nonsynonymous CTTN coding SNP Ser484Asn (rs56162978, G/A) in a severe sepsis cohort (725 Black subjects) revealed significant association with increased risk of sepsis mortality. In a separate cohort of sickle cell disease (SCD) subjects with and without ACS (177 SCD Black subjects), significantly increased risk of ACS and increased ACS severity (need for mechanical ventilation) was observed in carriers of the A allele. Human lung EC expressing the cortactin S484N transgene exhibited: (i) delayed EC barrier recovery following thrombin-induced permeability; (ii) reduced levels of critical Tyr486 cortactin phosphorylation; (iii) inhibited binding to the cytoskeletal regulator, nmMLCK; and (iv) attenuated EC barrier-promoting lamellipodia dynamics and biophysical responses. ARDS-challenged Cttn+/- heterozygous mice exhibited increased lung vascular permeability (compared to wild-type mice) which was significantly attenuated by IV delivery of liposomes encargoed with CTTN WT transgene but not by CTTN S484N transgene. In summary, these studies suggest that the CTTN S484N coding SNP contributes to severity of inflammatory injury in Black patients, potentially via delayed vascular barrier restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular hydrogen exerts biological effects on nearly all organs. It has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging effects and contributes to the regulation of autophagy and cell death. As the primary organ for gas exchange, the lungs are constantly exposed to various harmful environmental irritants. Short- or long-term exposure to these harmful substances often results in lung injury, causing respiratory and lung diseases. Acute and chronic respiratory diseases have high rates of morbidity and mortality and have become a major public health concern worldwide. For example, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic. An increasing number of studies have revealed that hydrogen may protect the lungs from diverse diseases, including acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung cancer, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we highlight the multiple functions of hydrogen and the mechanisms underlying its protective effects in various lung diseases, with a focus on its roles in disease pathogenesis and clinical significance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plasma EFEMP1 Is Associated with Brain Aging and Dementia: The Framingham Heart Study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34958018/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Epidermal growth factor containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein-1 (EFEMP1) has been associated with increased white matter hyperintensities (WMH) burden and disorders of premature aging and may have a shared pathophysiological role in the development of WMH and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To determine the association between plasma EFEMP1 levels and MRI markers of vascular brain injury and incident all-cause and Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We measured plasma EFEMP1 levels in 1597 [53% women, mean age 68.7 (SD 5.7) years] dementia-free Framingham Offspring cohort participants between 1998-2001 and subsequently followed them for incident dementia. Secondary outcomes included stroke, structural MRI brain measures and neurocognitive test performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; During a median 11.8 [Q1, Q3 : 7.1, 13.3] year follow-up, 131 participants developed dementia. The highest quintile of plasma EFEMP1, compared to the bottom four quintiles, was associated with an increased risk of time to incident all-cause dementia (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.18-2.64) and AD dementia (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.11-2.81) but not with markers of vascular brain injury (WMH, covert brain infarcts or stroke). Higher circulating EFEMP1 concentrations were also cross-sectionally associated with lower total brain (β±SE, -0.28±0.11, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01) and hippocampal volumes (-0.006±0.003, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04) and impaired abstract reasoning (Similarities test, -0.18±0.08, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.018 per standard deviation increment in EFEMP1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Elevated circulating EFEMP1 is associated with an increased risk of all-cause and AD dementia, smaller hippocampal and total brain volumes, and poorer cognitive performance. EFEMP1 may play an important biological role in the development of AD dementia. Further studies to validate these findings are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of ferroptosis in acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a common disease with high morbidity and mortality, and its pathogenesis is believed to be related to oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, and hypoxia. Ferroptosis is a type of nonapoptotic cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxide accumulation and is involved in many cellular physiological processes. Recent studies have confirmed that ferroptosis may be involved in the development of ALI. This review summarizes the most recent discoveries on the role of ferroptosis in ALI to provide new strategies for its prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcriptional analysis of lung fibroblasts identifies PIM1 signaling as a driver of aging-associated persistent fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35167499/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an aging-associated disease characterized by myofibroblast accumulation and progressive lung scarring. To identify transcriptional gene programs driving persistent lung fibrosis in aging, we performed RNA-Seq on lung fibroblasts isolated from young and aged mice during the early resolution phase after bleomycin injury. We discovered that, relative to injured young fibroblasts, injured aged fibroblasts exhibited a profibrotic state characterized by elevated expression of genes implicated in inflammation, matrix remodeling, and cell survival. We identified the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) and its target nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFATc1) as putative drivers of the sustained profibrotic gene signatures in injured aged fibroblasts. PIM1 and NFATc1 transcripts were enriched in a pathogenic fibroblast population recently discovered in IPF lungs, and their protein expression was abundant in fibroblastic foci. Overexpression of PIM1 in normal human lung fibroblasts potentiated their fibrogenic activation, and this effect was attenuated by NFATc1 inhibition. Pharmacological inhibition of PIM1 attenuated IPF fibroblast activation and sensitized them to apoptotic stimuli. Interruption of PIM1 signaling in IPF lung explants ex vivo inhibited prosurvival gene expression and collagen secretion, suggesting that targeting this pathway may represent a therapeutic strategy to block IPF progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MAP2K2 Delays Recovery in Murine Models of Acute Lung Injury and Associates with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Outcome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35157553/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a significant problem in need of new pharmaceutical approaches to improve its resolution. Studies comparing gene expression signatures in rodents and humans with lung injury reveal conserved pathways, including MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular signal-related protein kinase) activation. In preclinical acute lung injury (ALI) models, inhibition of MAP2K1 (MAPK kinase 1)/MAP2K2 (MAPK kinase 2) improves measures of ALI. Myeloid cell deletion of MAP2K1 results in sustained MAP2K2 activation and nonresolving ALI, suggesting that MAP2K2 deactivation may be a key driver of ALI resolution. We used human genomic data from the iSPAAR (Identification of SNPs Predisposing to Altered Acute Lung Injury Risk) Consortium to assess genetic variants in MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 for association with mortality from ARDS. To determine the role of MAP2K2 in ALI recovery, we studied mice deficient in &lt;em&gt;Map2k2&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Mek2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) and wild-type control mice in ALI models. We identified a MAP2K2 variant that was associated with death in ARDS and MAP2K2 expression. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa ALI, &lt;em&gt;Mek2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice had similar early alveolar neutrophilic recruitment but faster resolution of alveolar neutrophilia and vascular leak. Gene expression analysis revealed a role for MAP2K2 in promoting and sustaining select proinflammatory pathway activation in ALI. Bone marrow chimera studies indicate that leukocyte MAP2K2 is the key regulator of ALI duration. These studies implicate a role for MAP2K2 in ALI duration via transcriptional regulation of inflammatory programming with potential relevance to ARDS. Targeting leukocyte MAP2K2 may be an effective strategy to promote ALI resolution.

      <title>Acute cardiovascular effects of inhaled ambient particulate matter: Chemical composition-related oxidative stress, endothelin-1, blood pressure, and ST-segment changes in Wistar rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35157883/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimental evidence of particle composition as cardiovascular potency determinant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ambient particle inhalation, ROS/RNS-related perturbations in endothelin isoforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM-related molecular-level and relevant physiological/functional level changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Particle composition-led key mechanistic events explain BP/S-T segment changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-term increases in particulate matter (PM) are associated with heightened morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes. Inhalation of PM is known to increase endothelin (ET)-1 levels. Yet, less is known about particle composition-related changes at the molecular level including the endothelinergic system and relationship with cardiovascular function changes. In this work, adult Wistar male rats were exposed for 4 h by nose-only inhalation to clean air, Ottawa urban particles (EHC-93, 48 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and water-leached (EHC-93L, 49 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) particles, to examine the effect of particle compositional changes on oxidative stress, circulating ETs, blood pressure, and heart electrophysiology. Particle deposition in the respiratory compartment was estimated at 85 μg (25 ng/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Lung cell proliferation was low in both treatment groups, indicating absence of acute injury. Inhalation of EHC-93 caused statistically significant elevations (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) of oxidative stress markers, ET-1, ET-3, blood pressure, and a decrease of ST-segment duration in the ECG at 1.5 days post-exposure. Leached particles (EHC-93L) caused rapid but transient elevation (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) of oxidative stress, ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 at earlier time points, with no changes in blood pressure or ST-segment. These results demonstrate that inhalation of urban particles at an internal dose inadequate to cause acute lung injury can induce oxidative stress, enhance vasoactive endothelins, leading to vasopressor response, affecting cardiac electrophysiology in Wistar rats, consistent with the cardiovascular impacts of ambient particles in human populations. Change in particle potency after removal of soluble species, notably cadmium, zinc and polar organics suggests that the toxicodynamics of cardiovascular effects can be modified by physicochemical properties of particles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dexamethasone-loaded ROS-responsive poly(thioketal) nanoparticles suppress inflammation and oxidative stress of acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A therapeutic nanoplatform with ROS-responsiveness was developed for the regulation of inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NPs composed of low Mw of PPADT and high Mw of PTKU were loaded with dexamethasone to obtain a self-adaptive system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dex-loaded NPs significantly decreased lung inflammation, and reduced lung injury and mortality &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with excessive inflammatory response, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) without timely treatment. A fewer effective drugs are available currently to treat the ALI/ARDS. Herein, a therapeutic nanoplatform with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsiveness was developed for the regulation of inflammation. Dexamethasone acetate (Dex) was encapsulated into poly(thioketal) polymers to form polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) (PTKNPs@Dex). The NPs were composed of poly(1,4-phenyleneacetonedimethylene thioketal) (PPADT) and polythioketal urethane (PTKU), in which the thioketal bonds could be cleaved by the high level of ROS at the ALI site. The PTKNPs@Dex could accumulate in the pulmonary inflammatory sites and release the encapsulated payloads rapidly, leading to the decreased ROS level, less generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduced lung injury and mortality of mice. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that the therapeutic efficacy of the NPs was associated with the modulation of many immune and inflammation-linked pathways. These findings provide a newly developed nanoplatform for the efficient treatment of ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung injury caused by aspiration of organophosphorus insecticide and gastric contents in pigs</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35147477/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Patients who require mechanical ventilation after self-poisoning with ingested organophosphorus (OP) insecticides often die. Aspiration of stomach contents may contribute to lung injury and lethality. This study was designed to assess the severity of direct and indirect pulmonary injury created by pulmonary instillation of mixtures of OP insecticide, solvent (Solv) and porcine gastric juice (GJ) compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Terminally anaesthetised minipigs (groups n = 5) were exposed to sham bronchoscopy or given mixtures (0.5 mL/kg) of: saline, GJ, OP insecticide and GJ (OP + GJ), or Solv and GJ (Solv + GJ), placed into the right lung, and monitored for 48 h. Lung injury was assessed through analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), computed tomography and histopathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; OP + GJ created a direct lung injury consisting of neutrophil infiltration, oedema and haemorrhage, as well as indirect injury to the other lung. OP + GJ directly-injured lung parenchyma had increased concentrations of BALF protein, albumin, IL-6, IL-8 and C-reactive protein (CRP) at 24 h (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and BALF protein, albumin and CRP at 48 h (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), when compared with controls. Aspiration of GJ produced similar direct effects to OP + GJ but less indirect lung injury. Lung injury was less severe after Solv + GJ, for combined lung histopathology scores (vs. OP + GJ, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and for the proportion of directly-injured lung that was poorly/non-aerated at 48 h.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Pulmonary instillation of OP + GJ created more lung damage than controls or Solv + GJ. In patients with severe OP insecticide poisoning and reduced consciousness, early airway protection is likely to reduce pulmonary damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Roles of Mineralocorticoid Receptors in Cardiovascular and Cardiorenal Diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35143332/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation in the heart and vessels leads to pathological effects, such as excessive extracellular matrix accumulation, oxidative stress, and sustained inflammation. In these organs, the MR is expressed in cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and inflammatory cells. We review the accumulating experimental and clinical evidence that pharmacological MR antagonism has a positive impact on a battery of cardiac and vascular pathological states, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmic diseases, atherosclerosis, vascular stiffness, and cardiac and vascular injury linked to metabolic comorbidities and chronic kidney disease. Moreover, we present perspectives on optimization of the use of MR antagonists in patients more likely to respond to such therapy and review the evidence suggesting that novel nonsteroidal MR antagonists offer an improved safety profile while retaining their cardiovascular protective effects. Finally, we highlight future therapeutic applications of MR antagonists in cardiovascular injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of S100B/RAGE-enhanced ADAM17 activation in endothelial glycocalyx shedding after traumatic brain injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35148784/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the main causes for disability and death worldwide. While the primary mechanical injury cannot be avoided, the prevention of secondary injury is the focus of TBI research. Present study aimed to elucidate the effects and mechanisms of S100B and its receptor RAGE on mediating secondary injury after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; This study established TBI animal model by fluid percussion injury in rats, cell model by stretch-injured in astrocytes, and endothelial injury model with conditioned medium stimulation. Pharmacological intervention was applied to interfere the activities of S100B/RAGE/ADAM17 signaling pathway, respectively. The expressions or contents of S100B, RAGE, syndecan-1 and ADAM17 in brain and serum, as well as in cultured cells and medium, were detected by western blot. The distribution of relative molecules was observed with immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that TBI could activate the release of S100B, mostly from astrocytes, and S100B and RAGE could mutually regulate their expression and activation. Most importantly, present study revealed an obvious increase of syndecan-1 in rat serum or in endothelial cultured medium after injury, and a significant decrease in tissue and in cultured endothelial cells, indicating TBI-induced shedding of endothelial glycocalyx. The data further proved that the activation of S100B/RAGE signaling could promote the shedding of endothelial glycocalyx by enhancing the expression, translocation and activity of ADAM17, an important sheddase, in endothelial cells. The damage of endothelial glycocalyx consequently aggravated blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and systemic vascular hyper-permeability, overall resulting in secondary brain and lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; TBI triggers the activation of S100B/RAGE signal pathway. The regulation S100B/RAGE on ADAM17 expression, translocation and activation further promotes the shedding of endothelial glycocalyx, aggravates the dysfunction of BBB, and increases the vascular permeability, leading to secondary brain and lung injury. Present study may open a new corridor for the more in-depth understanding of the molecular processes responsible for cerebral and systemic vascular barrier impairment and secondary injury after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blocking the human common beta subunit of the GM-CSF, IL-5 and IL-3 receptors markedly reduces hyperinflammation in ARDS models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35145069/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is triggered by various aetiological factors such as trauma, sepsis and respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Immune profiling of severe COVID-19 patients has identified a complex pattern of cytokines including granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-5, which are significant mediators of viral-induced hyperinflammation. This strong response has prompted the development of therapies that block GM-CSF and other cytokines individually to limit inflammation related pathology. The common cytokine binding site of the human common beta (β&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor signals for three inflammatory cytokines: GM-CSF, IL-5 and IL-3. In this study, β&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; was targeted with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) CSL311 in engineered mice devoid of mouse β&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and βIL-3 and expressing human β&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; (hβ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;Tg mice). Direct pulmonary administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused ARDS-like lung injury, and CSL311 markedly reduced lung inflammation and oedema, resulting in improved oxygen saturation levels in hβ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;Tg mice. In a separate model, influenza (HKx31) lung infection caused viral pneumonia associated with a large influx of myeloid cells into the lungs of hβ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;Tg mice. The therapeutic application of CSL311 potently decreased accumulation of monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils without altering lung viral loads. Furthermore, CSL311 treatment did not limit the viral-induced expansion of NK and NKT cells, or the tissue expression of type I/II/III interferons needed for efficient viral clearance. Simultaneously blocking GM-CSF, IL-5 and IL-3 signalling with CSL311 may represent an improved and clinically applicable strategy to reducing hyperinflammation in the ARDS setting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mucosal healing is a key treatment goal for inflammatory bowel disease, and adequate epithelial regeneration is required for an intact gut epithelium. However, the underlying mechanism for mucosal healing is unclear. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be involved in the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we report that a lncRNA named Gm31629 decreased in intestinal epithelial cells in response to inflammatory stimulation. Gm31629 deficiency led to exacerbated intestinal inflammation and delayed epithelial regeneration in dextran sulfate sodium-induced (DSS-induced) colitis model. Mechanistically, Gm31629 promoted E2F pathways and cell proliferation by stabilizing Y-box protein 1 (YB-1), thus facilitating epithelial regeneration. Genetic overexpression of Gm31629 protected against DSS-induced colitis in vivo. Theaflavin 3-gallate, a natural compound mimicking Gm31629, alleviated DSS-induced epithelial inflammation and mucosal damage. These results demonstrate an essential role of lncRNA Gm31629 in linking intestinal inflammation and epithelial cell proliferation, providing a potential therapeutic approach to inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ACSL4 deficiency confers protection against ferroptosis-mediated acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35180475/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term ferroptosis coined in 2012 causes acute kidney injury (AKI). However, its pathway mechanism in AKI is poorly understood. In this study, we conducted an RNA-sequence analysis of kidneys in AKI and normal mice to explore the pathway mechanism of ferroptosis. Consequently, differentially expressed genes highlighted Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family (ACSL4), a known promotor for ferroptosis. Besides, RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed its upregulation. HIF-1α was downregulated in I/R-AKI mice, and in vitro studies confirmed a negative regulation of HIF-1α on ACSL4. To explore the role of ACSL4 in AKI, we constructed ACSL4 knockout in kidney tubules of mice-as Cdh16Cre-ACSL4&lt;sup&gt;F/F&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Results revealed that ACSL4 knockout significantly reduced ferroptosis and inhibited the functional and pathological injury of AKI mice. Meanwhile, the kidneys of Cdh16Cre-ACSL4&lt;sup&gt;F/F&lt;/sup&gt; mice demonstrated a significantly decreased inflammation and macrophage infiltration. Further, additional explorations were explored to decipher a more thorough understanding of ferroptotic immunogenicity. As a result, neutrophils were not directly recruited by ferroptotic cells, but by ferroptotic cell-induced macrophages. Further, ACSL4 inhibitor rosiglitazone significantly inhibited AKI. Collectively, these data provide novel insights into the AKI pathogenesis, and defined ACSL4 as an effective target in AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ADAM8 signaling drives neutrophil migration and ARDS severity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) results in catastrophic lung failure and has an urgent, unmet need for improved early recognition and therapeutic development. Neutrophil influx is a hallmark of ARDS and is associated with the release of tissue-destructive immune effectors, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and membrane-anchored metalloproteinase disintegrins (ADAMs). Here, we observed using intravital microscopy that Adam8-/- mice had impaired neutrophil transmigration. In mouse pneumonia models, both genetic deletion and pharmacologic inhibition of ADAM8 attenuated neutrophil infiltration and lung injury while improving bacterial containment. Unexpectedly, the alterations of neutrophil function were not attributable to impaired proteolysis but resulted from reduced intracellular interactions of ADAM8 with the actin-based motor molecule Myosin1f that suppressed neutrophil motility. In 2 ARDS cohorts, we analyzed lung fluid proteolytic signatures and identified that ADAM8 activity was positively correlated with disease severity. We propose that in acute inflammatory lung diseases such as pneumonia and ARDS, ADAM8 inhibition might allow fine-tuning of neutrophil responses for therapeutic gain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disulfiram inhibits neutrophil extracellular trap formation and protects rodents from acute lung injury and SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35133984/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute lung injury has few treatment options and a high mortality rate. Upon injury, neutrophils infiltrate the lungs and form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), damaging the lungs and driving an exacerbated immune response. Unfortunately, no drug preventing NET formation has completed clinical development. Here, we report that disulfiram - an FDA-approved drug for alcohol use disorder - dramatically reduced NETs, increased survival, improved blood oxygenation, and reduced lung edema in a transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) mouse model. We then tested whether disulfiram could confer protection in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as NETs are elevated in patients with severe COVID-19. In SARS-CoV-2-infected golden hamsters, disulfiram reduced NETs and perivascular fibrosis in the lungs, and it downregulated innate immune and complement/coagulation pathways, suggesting that it could be beneficial for patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, an existing FDA-approved drug can block NET formation and improve disease course in 2 rodent models of lung injury for which treatment options are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung Ultrasound and Electrical Impedance Tomography During Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35132021/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35132021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; Lung damage during mechanical ventilation involves lung volume and alveolar water content, and lung ultrasound (LUS) and electrical impedance tomography changes are related to these variables. We investigated whether these techniques may detect any signal modification during the development of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design:&lt;/em&gt; Experimental animal study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting:&lt;/em&gt; Experimental Department of a University Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjects:&lt;/em&gt; Forty-two female pigs (24.2 ± 2.0 kg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interventions:&lt;/em&gt; The animals were randomized into three groups (n = 14): high tidal volume (TV) (mean TV, 803.0 ± 121.7 mL), high respiratory rate (RR) (mean RR, 40.3 ± 1.1 beats/min), and high positive-end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (mean PEEP, 24.0 ± 1.1 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). The study lasted 48 hours. At baseline and at 30 minutes, and subsequently every 6 hours, we recorded extravascular lung water, end-expiratory lung volume, lung strain, respiratory mechanics, hemodynamics, and gas exchange. At the same time-point, end-expiratory impedance was recorded relatively to the baseline. LUS was assessed every 12 hours in 12 fields, each scoring from 0 (presence of A-lines) to 3 (consolidation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and main results:&lt;/em&gt; In a multiple regression model, the ratio between extravascular lung water and end-expiratory lung volume was significantly associated with the LUS total score (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.002; adjusted &lt;em&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 0.21). The variables independently associated with the end-expiratory difference in lung impedance were lung strain (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; adjusted &lt;em&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 0.18) and extravascular lung water (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; adjusted &lt;em&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 0.11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Data suggest as follows. First, what determines the LUS score is the ratio between water and gas and not water alone. Therefore, caution is needed when an improvement of LUS score follows a variation of the lung gas content, as after a PEEP increase. Second, what determines the end-expiratory difference in lung impedance is the strain level that may disrupt the intercellular junction, therefore altering lung impedance. In addition, the increase in extravascular lung water during VILI development contributed to the observed decrease in impedance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PACS-2 Ameliorates Tubular Injury by Facilitating Endoplasmic Reticulum-Mitochondria Contact and Mitophagy in Diabetic Nephropathy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35133431/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM) may have a role in tubular injury in diabetic nephropathy (DN), but the precise mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS-2), a critical regulator of MAM formation, is significantly decreased in renal tubules of patients with DN, and PACS-2 expression is positively correlated with renal function and negatively correlated with degrees of tubulointerstitial lesions. Conditional deletion of Pacs-2 in proximal tubules (PTs) aggravates albuminuria and tubular injury in a streptozotocin-induced mouse model of diabetes. Mitochondrial fragmentation, MAM disruption, and defective mitophagy accompanied by altered expression of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagic proteins, including Drp1 and Becn1, are observed in tubules of diabetic mice; these changes are more pronounced in PT-specific Pacs-2 knockout mice. In vitro, overexpression of PACS-2 in HK-2 cells alleviates excessive mitochondrial fission induced by high glucose concentrations through blocking mitochondrial recruitment of DRP1 and subsequently restores MAM integrity and enhances mitophagy. Mechanistically, PACS-2 binds to BECN1 and mediates the relocalization of BECN1 to MAM, where it promotes the formation of mitophagosome. Together, these data highlight an important but previously unrecognized role of PACS-2 in ameliorating tubular injury in DN by facilitating MAM formation and mitophagy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ruxolitinib attenuates secondary injury after traumatic spinal cord injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35142693/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation post-traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) induces microglial activation, which leads to prolonged neurological dysfunction. However, the mechanism underlying microglial activation-induced neuroinflammation remains poorly understood. Ruxolitinib (RUX), a selective inhibitor of JAK1/2, was recently reported to inhibit inflammatory storms caused by SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. However, its role in disrupting inflammation post-SCI has not been confirmed. In this study, microglia were treated with RUX for 24 hours and then activated with interferon-γ for 6 hours. The results showed that interferon-γ-induced phosphorylation of JAK and STAT in microglia was inhibited, and the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and cell proliferation marker Ki67 were reduced. In further in vivo experiments, a mouse model of spinal cord injury was treated intragastrically with RUX for 3 successive days, and the findings suggest that RUX can inhibit microglial proliferation by inhibiting the interferon-γ/JAK/STAT pathway. Moreover, microglia treated with RUX centripetally migrated toward injured foci, remaining limited and compacted within the glial scar, which resulted in axon preservation and less demyelination. Moreover, the protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 were reduced. The neuromotor function of SCI mice also recovered. These findings suggest that RUX can inhibit neuroinflammation through inhibiting the interferon-γ/JAK/STAT pathway, thereby reducing secondary injury after SCI and producing neuroprotective effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The murine caspase-11 non-canonical inflammasome responds to various bacterial infections. Caspase-11 activation-induced pyroptosis, in response to cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is critical for endotoxic shock in mice. The mechanism underlying cytosolic LPS sensing and the responsible pattern recognition receptor are unknown. Here we show that human monocytes, epithelial cells and keratinocytes undergo necrosis upon cytoplasmic delivery of LPS. LPS-induced cytotoxicity was mediated by human caspase-4 that could functionally complement murine caspase-11. Human caspase-4 and the mouse homologue caspase-11 (hereafter referred to as caspase-4/11) and also human caspase-5, directly bound to LPS and lipid A with high specificity and affinity. LPS associated with endogenous caspase-11 in pyroptotic cells. Insect-cell purified caspase-4/11 underwent oligomerization upon LPS binding, resulting in activation of the caspases. Underacylated lipid IVa and lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (LPS-RS) could bind to caspase-4/11 but failed to induce their oligomerization and activation. LPS binding was mediated by the CARD domain of the caspase. Binding-deficient CARD-domain point mutants did not respond to LPS with oligomerization or activation and failed to induce pyroptosis upon LPS electroporation or bacterial infections. The function of caspase-4/5/11 represents a new mode of pattern recognition in immunity and also an unprecedented means of caspase activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coding and long non-coding gene expression changes in the CNS traumatic injuries</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35129669/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) are two main central nervous system (CNS) traumas, caused by external physical insults. Both injuries have devastating effects on the quality of life, and there is no effective therapy at present. Notably, gene expression profiling using bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) have revealed significant changes in many coding and non-coding genes, as well as important pathways in SCI and TBI. Particularly, recent studies have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with lengths greater than 200 nucleotides and without protein-coding potential have tissue- and cell type-specific expression pattern and play critical roles in CNS injury by gain- and loss-of-function approaches. LncRNAs have been shown to regulate protein-coding genes or microRNAs (miRNAs) directly or indirectly, participating in processes including inflammation, glial activation, cell apoptosis, and vasculature events. Therefore, lncRNAs could serve as potential targets for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of SCI and TBI. In this review, we highlight the recent progress in transcriptome studies of SCI and TBI and insights into molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GSDMD-miR-223-NLRP3 axis involved in B(a)P-induced inflammatory injury of alveolar epithelial cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35144130/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pyroptosis occurred simultaneously when B(a)P-induced inflammatory injury in alveolar epithelial A549 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NLRP3 and miRNA-223 were inhibited when knockout of GSDMD in B(a)P-induced A549 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NLRP3 were increased when inhibiting miR-223 in B(a)P-induced A549 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GSDMD may regulate NLRP3 inflammasome through miR-223 in B(a)P induced inflammatory damage in A549 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P], a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, causes lung inflammatory damage. Pyroptosis，a new inflammation-dependent programmed cell death, happened when pyroptosis-related GSDMD is activated mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome. microRNA-223 (miRNA-223) is involved in inflammatory diseases by regulating NLRP3. However, whether GSDMD regulate NLRP3 inflammasome through miR-223 in B(a)P induced lung inflammatory injury remain unknown. In this study, alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were stimulated with 0, 2, 4, 8 μM B(a)P for 12 h or 24 h. The inflammatory injury and pyroptosis were determined. And the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and the level of miRNA-223 were detected. Then, the change of inflammatory injury and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in B(a)P-induced A549 cells were detected after inhibiting of GSDMD or miR-223 using siRNA-GSDMD (siGSDMD) or miR-223 inhibitor, respectively. Our results indicated that after B(a)P exposure, TNF-α and IL-6 in the supernatant were increased. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) results showed that A549 cells were obviously swollen and the cell membrane ruptured. Hoechest33342/PI staining showed that pyroptosis occurred. NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18, GSDMD, GSDMD-N, pro caspase-1 and cleaved caspase-1 were significantly increased. Additionally, after transfecting with siGSDMD in B(a)P-induced A549 cells, the expression level of miR-223 was significantly increased. But IL-6 and TNF-α in the supernatant, the expression of NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18 and cleaved caspase-1 protein were also decreased. And after inhibiting miR-223 in B(a)P-induced A549 cells, the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in the supernatant, the protein expression of NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18 and cleaved caspase-1 were increased. In conclusion, GSDMD may regulate NLRP3 inflammasome through miR-223, which is involved in B(a)P induced inflammatory damage in A549 cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Endothelial Shp2 deficiency controls alternative activation of macrophage preventing radiation-induced lung injury through notch signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35243230/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phosphatase activity of endothelial Shp2 is elevated by irradiation &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radiation-induced Jag1 is blocked in Shp2-deficient endothelium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of Shp2 in endothelium relieves radiation-induced pulmonary injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shp2-deficient endothelium restrains macrophage activation via Notch signaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury is a common late side effect of thoracic radiotherapy. Endothelial dysfunction following leukocytes infiltration is a prominent feature in this process. Here, we established a clinical-mimicking mouse model of radiation-induced lung injury and found the activity of phosphatase Shp2 was elevated in endothelium after injury. Endothelium-specific Shp2 deletion mice showed relieved collagen deposition along with disrupted radiation-induced Jag1 expression in the endothelium. Furthermore, endothelium-derived Jag1 activated the alternative activation of macrophages &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; by paracrine Notch signaling. Consistently, the Notch pathway was significantly activated by chest irradiation in the peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with cancer. Collectively, our work demonstrates that Shp2 participates in the radiation-induced endothelial dysfunction and subsequently inflammatory microenvironment producing during radiation-induced lung injury. Our findings indicate Shp2 as a potential target for radiation-induced lung injury and provide another way for endothelium to participate in the pathological process of radiation-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has induced a worldwide pandemic since early 2020. COVID-19 causes pulmonary inflammation, secondary pulmonary fibrosis (PF); however, there are still no effective treatments for PF. The present study aimed to explore the inhibitory effect of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) on pulmonary inflammation and PF, and its molecular mechanism. Morphological changes and collagen deposition were analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson staining, and the hydroxyproline content. DHA attenuated early alveolar inflammation and later PF in a bleomycin-induced rat PF model, and inhibited the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 3 (CCL3) in model rat serum. Further molecular analysis revealed that both pulmonary inflammation and PF were associated with increased transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2), and signal transducer and activator 3(STAT3) expression in the lung tissues of model rats. DHA reduced the inflammatory response and PF in the lungs by suppressing TGF-β1, JAK2, phosphorylated (p)-JAK2, STAT3, and p-STAT3. Thus, DHA exerts therapeutic effects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and PF by inhibiting JAK2-STAT3 activation. DHA inhibits alveolar inflammation, and attenuates lung injury and fibrosis, possibly representing a therapeutic candidate to treat PF associated with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effect of α-tocopherol in alleviating the lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35112986/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leads to the acute lung injury (ALI), a form of diffused alveolars injury, accompanied by severe inflammation and oxidative damage of alveolar epithelial cells. α-Tocopherol (α-TOH), one of the eight isoforms of vitamin E, is a natural antioxidant-free radical. We aimed to understand the effect of α-TOH and mechanism involved in inducing the ALI. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is injected into the trachea of mice to generate ALI mouse models. α-TOH was used to administrate the mice intragastrically to detect the expression of inflammatory factors and antioxidant molecules by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining. Mouse alveolar epithelial cell line (MLE-12 cells) was used to determine the effect of α-TOH on alveolar epithelial cells. Inflammatory factors such as, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α shows significant increase in the lung tissues of the mice induced by LPS and reduction in the expressions of superoxide dismutase (SOD)1/2 and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). After treatment with α-TOH, the inflammation and oxidative stress levels shows substantial reduction in the lung tissues of the mice. Moreover, α-TOH also increases the proliferation ability of MLE-12 cells in vitro and reduces apoptosis level. In addition, α-TOH reduces p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in alveolar epithelial cells &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, thus, inhibiting the activity of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. α-TOH reduces the inflammation and oxidative stress of lung tissue by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby alleviating the LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knockdown of receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) alleviated lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, apoptosis and permeability in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells by regulating C-terminal binding protein 2 (CTBP2)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35113002/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main pathological feature of acute lung injury (ALI) is pulmonary edema caused by increased permeability of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). LPS was has been confirmed to lead to cell damage and barrier dysfunction in PMVECs. Furthermore, receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) was discovered to be increased in LPS-induced human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), but the mechanism of RIP140 on LPS-induced HPMECs has not been investigated. In this study, an acute lung injury model was constructed in LPS-induced HPMECs. After RIP140 was downregulated, inflammation, apoptosis and cell permeability levels were detected by RT-qPCR, TUNEL staining and FITC-Dextran, respectively. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels of related factors. The binding of RIP140 and C-terminal binding protein 2 (CTBP2) was predicted by database and verified by Co-IP. Subsequently, CTBP2 overexpression was transfected into cells and the above experiments were performed again. The results showed that inflammation, apoptosis and permeability levels of LPS-induced HPMECs were remarkably increased compared to the untreated control group. However, these levels were suppressed after RIP140 was silenced compared to the LPS-induced HPMECs group. Notably, the Co-IP study demonstrated that RIP140 and CTBP2 interacted with each other. Moreover, CTBP2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of RIP140 silencing on LPS-induced inflammation, apoptosis and permeability levels in HPMECs. Together, the study found that interference of RIP140 could alleviate LPS-induced inflammation, apoptosis and permeability in HPMECs by regulating CTBP2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long non-coding RNA growth arrest specific 5 is downregulated in sepsis-ALI and inhibits apoptosis by up-regulating miR-146a</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35112981/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) growth arrest specific 5 (GAS5) and microRNA (miR)-146a both have inhibitory effects on LPS-induced inflammation, suggesting the crosstalk between them. In this study, the expression of GAS5 and miR-146a in patients with sepsis-induced acute lung injury (sepsis-ALI), sepsis patients without obvious complications (sepsis) and healthy controls were studied by RT-qPCR. The role of GAS5 in the expression and methylation of miR-146a in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) were studied by RT-qPCR and methylation-specific PCR (MSP), respectively. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that GAS5 and miR-146a were downregulated in sepsis-ALI and the expression of these two were correlated. LPS induced the downregulation of GAS5 and miR-146a in HBEpCs. In HBEpCs, overexpression of GAS5 increased the expression levels of miR-146a and reduced the methylation of miR-146a gene. Under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, overexpression of GAS5 and miR-146a decreased the apoptotic rate of HBEpCs. Moreover, the combined overexpression of GAS5 and miR-146a showed stronger effects. Therefore, GAS5 is downregulated in sepsis-ALI and inhibits cell apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of miR-146a.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maladaptive functional changes in alveolar fibroblasts due to perinatal hyperoxia impair epithelial differentiation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35113810/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infants born prematurely worldwide have up to a 50% chance of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a clinical morbidity characterized by dysregulated lung alveolarization and microvascular development. It is known that PDGFR alpha-positive (PDGFRA+) fibroblasts are critical for alveolarization and that PDGFRA+ fibroblasts are reduced in BPD. A better understanding of fibroblast heterogeneity and functional activation status during pathogenesis is required to develop mesenchymal population-targeted therapies for BPD. In this study, we utilized a neonatal hyperoxia mouse model (90% O2 postnatal days 0-7, PN0-PN7) and performed studies on sorted PDGFRA+ cells during injury and room air recovery. After hyperoxia injury, PDGFRA+ matrix and myofibroblasts decreased and PDGFRA+ lipofibroblasts increased by transcriptional signature and population size. PDGFRA+ matrix and myofibroblasts recovered during repair (PN10). After 7 days of in vivo hyperoxia, PDGFRA+ sorted fibroblasts had reduced contractility in vitro, reflecting loss of myofibroblast commitment. Organoids made with PN7 PDGFRA+ fibroblasts from hyperoxia in mice exhibited reduced alveolar type 1 cell differentiation, suggesting reduced alveolar niche-supporting PDGFRA+ matrix fibroblast function. Pathway analysis predicted reduced WNT signaling in hyperoxia fibroblasts. In alveolar organoids from hyperoxia-exposed fibroblasts, WNT activation by CHIR increased the size and number of alveolar organoids and enhanced alveolar type 2 cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanocurcumin Potently Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Induced Cytokine Storm by Deactivation of MAPK/NF-κB Signaling in Epithelial Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35112841/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interleukin-mediated deep cytokine storm, an aggressive inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in COVID-19 patients, is correlated directly with lung injury, multi-organ failure, and poor prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients. Curcumin (CUR), a phenolic antioxidant compound obtained from turmeric (&lt;em&gt;Curcuma longa L.&lt;/em&gt;), is well-known for its strong anti-inflammatory activity. However, its &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; efficacy is constrained due to poor bioavailability. Herein, we report that CUR-encapsulated polysaccharide nanoparticles (CUR-PS-NPs) potently inhibit the release of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors associated with damage of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (CoV2-SP)-stimulated liver Huh7.5 and lung A549 epithelial cells. Treatment with CUR-PS-NPs effectively attenuated the interaction of ACE2 and CoV2-SP. The effects of CUR-PS-NPs were linked to reduced NF-κB/MAPK signaling which in turn decreased CoV2-SP-mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK, and p65/NF-κB as well as nuclear p65/NF-κB expression. The findings of the study strongly indicate that organic NPs of CUR can be used to control hyper-inflammatory responses and prevent lung and liver injuries associated with CoV2-SP-mediated cytokine storm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dipeptidase-1 governs renal inflammation during ischemia reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35108057/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms that drive leukocyte recruitment to the kidney are incompletely understood. Dipeptidase-1 (DPEP1) is a major neutrophil adhesion receptor highly expressed on proximal tubular cells and peritubular capillaries of the kidney. Renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) induces robust neutrophil and monocyte recruitment and causes acute kidney injury (AKI). Renal inflammation and the AKI phenotype were attenuated in &lt;em&gt;Dpep1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice or mice pretreated with DPEP1 antagonists, including the LSALT peptide, a nonenzymatic DPEP1 inhibitor. DPEP1 deficiency or inhibition primarily blocked neutrophil adhesion to peritubular capillaries and reduced inflammatory monocyte recruitment to the kidney after IRI. CD44 but not ICAM-1 blockade also decreased neutrophil recruitment to the kidney during IRI and was additive to DPEP1 effects. DPEP1, CD44, and ICAM-1 all contributed to the recruitment of monocyte/macrophages to the kidney following IRI. These results identify DPEP1 as a major leukocyte adhesion receptor in the kidney and potential therapeutic target for AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FGF10 protects against particulate matter (PM)-induced lung injury via regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35114441/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35114441/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Particulate matter (PM)-induced lung injury is closely related to the development of respiratory diseases, and the genotoxicity of PM involves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ERS lays the basis of PM-induced lung injury characteristic of secretion of inflammatory mediators from bronchial epithelial cells, and fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) protects against PM-induced lung injury through regulation of ERS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The regulatory mechanism of FGF10 on ERS in PM-induced lung injury involves ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure of the lungs to particulate matter (PM) leads to the development of respiratory disease and involves mechanisms such as oxydative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, there are no effective therapies to treat PM-induced lung diseases. Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) is a multifunctional growth factor mediating mesenchymal-to-epithelial signaling and displaying a significant therapeutic potential following injury. The present research aims to investigate the regulatory mechanism of FGF10 on ER stress in PM-induced lung injury. PM-induced lung injury leads to peribronchial wall thickening and marked infiltration of inflammatory cells which is associated with increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines. The results show that FGF10 treatment attenuates PM-induced lung injury in vivo and reversed ER stress protein GRP78 and CHOP levels. Moreover, comparison of human bronchial epithelial cells cultured with PM and FGF10 vs PM alone shows sustained cell proliferation and restrained secretion of inflammatory cytokines supporting FGF10&amp;rsquo;s protective role. Significantly, both ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT inhibitors largely abolished the impact of FGF10 on PM-induced ER stress. Taken together, both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that FGF10, via the activation of ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling, protects against PM-induced lung injury through the regulation of ER stress. Therefore, FGF10 represents a potential therapy for PM-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung Clearance Index May Detect Early Peripheral Lung Disease in Sickle Cell Anemia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35104199/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic lung injury is common in sickle cell anemia (SCA) and worsens outcomes. Sensitive lung function tests might predict reversible disease that might benefit from therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; To evaluate whether lung clearance index (LCI) (measuring global ventilation inhomogeneity), intraacinar ventilation inhomogeneity (S&lt;sub&gt;acin&lt;/sub&gt;), and conductive ventilation inhomogeneity (S&lt;sub&gt;cond&lt;/sub&gt;) are more frequently abnormal than lung volumes in young people with SCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Nitrogen multiple-breath washout, spirometry, and body plethysmography were cross-sectionally evaluated at steady state in subjects with SCA (hemoglobin SS) and healthy control subjects aged 8-21 years from London, United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Thirty-five patients (51% boys, mean ± SD age, 16.4 ± 3.5 yr) and 31 control subjects (48% boys; 16.2 ± 3.2 yr) were tested. There were significant differences between the study and control groups in mean LCI (mean difference, 0.42 units; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 to 0.63; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0001), S&lt;sub&gt;acin&lt;/sub&gt; (mean difference, 0.014 units; 95% CI, 0.001 to 0.026; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) (mean difference, -0.79 z-scores; 95% CI, -1.28 to -0.30; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002), forced vital capacity (FVC) (mean difference, -0.80 z-scores; 95% CI, -1.28 to -0.31, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002), and total lung capacity (mean difference, -0.76 z-scores; 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.29, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002), but not in S&lt;sub&gt;cond&lt;/sub&gt; and FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-to-FVC ratio. Whereas 29% (10 of 35) of patients had LCI &amp;gt; 95th percentile of control subjects, 23% (8 of 35) had abnormal FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;lt;5th percentile of the reference population).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; LCI detected slightly more abnormalities than lung volumes in young people with SCA. Significant differences from control subjects in LCI and S&lt;sub&gt;acin&lt;/sub&gt; but not in S&lt;sub&gt;cond&lt;/sub&gt; and FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-to-FVC ratio suggest that the lung function changes were most likely owing to patchy peripheral lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;iNO may be used in ARDS and PH of the adults and may prevent ischemia/reperfusion injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iNO may have direct antimicrobial effect and may play a viricidal effect against Sars-CoV-2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iNO can be generated by pulsed electrical discharge and is safe for humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) acts as a selective pulmonary vasodilator and it is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. iNO has been demonstrated to effectively decrease pulmonary artery pressure and improve oxygenation, while decreasing extracorporeal life support use in hypoxic newborns affected by persistent pulmonary hypertension. Also, iNO seems a safe treatment with limited side effects. Despite the promising beneficial effects of NO in the preclinical literature, there is still a lack of high quality evidence for the use of iNO in clinical settings. A variety of clinical applications have been suggested in and out of the critical care environment, aiming to use iNO in respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension of adults or as a preventative measure of hemolysis-induced vasoconstriction, ischemia/reperfusion injury and as a potential treatment of renal failure associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. In this narrative review we aim to present a comprehensive summary of the potential use of iNO in several clinical conditions with its suggested benefits, including its recent application in the scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic. Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, guidelines, observational studies and case-series were reported and the main findings summarized. Furthermore, we will describe the toxicity profile of NO and discuss an innovative proposed strategy to produce iNO. Overall, iNO exhibits a wide range of potential clinical benefits, that certainly warrants further efforts with randomized clinical trials to determine specific therapeutic roles of iNO.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Lung Regeneration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lung is the primary site of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced immunopathology whereby the virus enters the host cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Sophisticated regeneration and repair programs exist in the lungs to replenish injured cell populations. However, known resident stem/progenitor cells have been demonstrated to express ACE2, raising a substantial concern regarding the long-term consequences of impaired lung regeneration after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, clinical treatments may also affect lung repair from antiviral drug candidates to mechanical ventilation. In this review, we highlight how SARS-CoV-2 disrupts a program that governs lung homeostasis. We also summarize the current efforts of targeted therapy and supportive treatments for COVID-19 patients. In addition, we discuss the pros and cons of cell therapy with mesenchymal stem cells or resident lung epithelial stem/progenitor cells in preventing post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. We propose that, in addition to symptomatic treatments being developed and applied in the clinic, targeting lung regeneration is also essential to restore lung homeostasis in COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adverse Mechanical Ventilation and Pneumococcal Pneumonia Induce Immune and Mitochondrial Dysfunctions Mitigated by Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Rabbits</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34965287/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Mechanical ventilation for pneumonia may contribute to lung injury due to factors that include mitochondrial dysfunction, and mesenchymal stem cells may attenuate injury. This study hypothesized that mechanical ventilation induces immune and mitochondrial dysfunction, with or without pneumococcal pneumonia, that could be mitigated by mesenchymal stem cells alone or combined with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male rabbits underwent protective mechanical ventilation (8 ml/kg tidal volume, 5 cm H2O end-expiratory pressure) or adverse mechanical ventilation (20 ml/kg tidal-volume, zero end-expiratory pressure) or were allowed to breathe spontaneously. The same settings were then repeated during pneumococcal pneumonia. Finally, infected animals during adverse mechanical ventilation received human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (3 × 106/kg, intravenous) and/or ceftaroline (20 mg/kg, intramuscular) or sodium chloride, 4 h after pneumococcal challenge. Twenty-four-hour survival (primary outcome), lung injury, bacterial burden, immune and mitochondrial dysfunction, and lung transcriptomes (secondary outcomes) were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; High-pressure adverse mechanical ventilation reduced the survival of infected animals (0%; 0 of 7) compared with spontaneous breathing (100%; 7 of 7) and protective mechanical ventilation (86%; 6 of 7; both _P &amp;lt; 0.001), with higher lung pathology scores (median [interquartile ranges], 5.5 [4.5 to 7.0] vs. 12.6 [12.0 to 14.0]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.046), interleukin-8 lung concentrations (106 [54 to 316] vs. 804 [753 to 868] pg/g of lung; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012), and alveolar mitochondrial DNA release (0.33 [0.28 to 0.36] vs. 0.98 [0.76 to 1.21] ng/μl; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with infected spontaneously breathing animals. Survival (0%; 0 of 7; control group) was improved by mesenchymal stem cells (57%; 4 of 7; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001) or ceftaroline alone (57%; 4 of 7; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and improved even more with a combination treatment (86%; 6 of 7; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Mesenchymal stem cells reduced lung pathology score (8.5 [7.0 to 10.5] vs. 12.6 [12.0 to 14.0]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.043) and alveolar mitochondrial DNA release (0.39 (0.34 to 0.65) vs. 0.98 (0.76 to 1.21) ng/μl; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.025). Mesenchymal stem cells combined with ceftaroline reduced interleukin-8 lung concentrations (665 [595 to 795] vs. 804 [753 to 868] pg/g of lung; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007) compared to ceftaroline alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In this preclinical study, mesenchymal stem cells improved the outcome of rabbits with pneumonia and high-pressure mechanical ventilation by correcting immune and mitochondrial dysfunction and when combined with the antibiotic ceftaroline was synergistic in mitigating lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ferret models of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop lung and liver disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35104244/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most common genetic cause and risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the field lacks a large-animal model that allows for longitudinal assessment of pulmonary function. We hypothesized that ferrets would model human AATD-related lung and hepatic disease. AAT-knockout (AAT-KO) and PiZZ (E342K, the most common mutation in humans) ferrets were generated and compared with matched controls using custom-designed flexiVent modules to perform pulmonary function tests, quantitative computed tomography (QCT), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) proteomics, and alveolar morphometry. Complete loss of AAT (AAT-KO) led to increased pulmonary compliance and expiratory airflow limitation, consistent with obstructive lung disease. QCT and morphometry confirmed emphysema and airspace enlargement, respectively. Pathway analysis of BAL proteomics data revealed inflammatory lung disease and impaired cellular migration. The PiZ mutation resulted in altered AAT protein folding in the liver, hepatic injury, and reduced plasma concentrations of AAT, and PiZZ ferrets developed obstructive lung disease. In summary, AAT-KO and PiZZ ferrets model the progressive obstructive pulmonary disease seen in AAT-deficient patients and may serve as a platform for preclinical testing of therapeutics including gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Health Effects of Dietary Oxidized Milk Administration in Offspring Mice during Pregnancy and Lactation with Metabolomic Strategies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35104143/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milk is an important source of nutrients during pregnancy. Previous studies have consistently shown that oxidation in milk and dairy products can induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver and kidney. However, the mechanism underlying these effects remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the effects of oxidized milk on fecal metabolism and liver and kidney function of offspring mice. Oxidative modification of milk was performed using H2O2-Cu or heating, causing varying degrees of oxidative damage. Kunming female mice were fed with a H2O2-Cu, heat, or normal control diet until their offspring were 3 weeks old. Feces were collected for the metabolomics study based on mass spectrometry. Forty-two potentially significant metabolic biomarkers were screened, and each group&amp;rsquo;s relative intensity was compared. The results showed that oxidized milk mainly regulated isoleucine metabolism, proline metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition, the histopathological analysis showed accumulation of protein and lipid oxidation products in the liver and kidney tissues after intake of oxidized milk, which induced oxidative stress, increased the levels of inflammatory factors, and significantly increased the expression of genes and proteins involved in inflammatory pathways. The above results suggest that intake of oxidized milk during gestation may increase the risk of liver and kidney injury in male offspring by interfering with amino acid and energy metabolism, highlighting the potential health risks of oxidized milk in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Precision targeting of the vagal anti-inflammatory pathway attenuates the systemic inflammatory response to burn injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34789702/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34789702/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) drives late morbidity and mortality after injury. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAchR) expressed on immune cells regulates the vagal anti-inflammatory pathway that prevents an overwhelming SIRS response to injury. Nonspecific pharmacologic stimulation of the vagus nerve has been evaluated as a potential therapeutic to limit SIRS. Unfortunately, the results of clinical trials have been underwhelming. We hypothesized that directly targeting the α7nAchR would more precisely stimulate the vagal anti-inflammatory pathway on immune cells and decrease gut and lung injury after severe burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice underwent 30% total body surface area steam burn. Mice were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of a selective agonist of the α7nAchR (AR-R17779) at 30 minutes postburn. Intestinal permeability to 4 kDa FITC-dextran was measured at multiple time points postinjury. Lung vascular permeability was measured 6 hours after burn injury. Serial behavioral assessments were performed to quantify activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Intestinal permeability peaked at 6 hours postburn. AR-R17779 decreased burn-induced intestinal permeability in a dose-dependent fashion (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). There was no difference in gut permeability to 4 kDa FITC-dextran between sham and burn-injured animals treated with 5 mg/kg of AR-R17779. While burn injury increased lung permeability 10-fold, AR-R17779 prevented burn-induced lung permeability with no difference compared with sham (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Postinjury activity levels were significantly improved in burned animals treated with AR-R17779.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Directly stimulating the α7nAchR prevents burn-induced gut and lung injury. Directly targeting the α7nAChR that mediates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory response may be an improved strategy compared with nonspecific vagal agonists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The molecular chaperone GRP170 protects against ER stress and acute kidney injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35104250/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular chaperones are responsible for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and one such chaperone, GRP170, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident that oversees both protein biogenesis and quality control. We previously discovered that GRP170 regulates the degradation and assembly of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which reabsorbs sodium in the distal nephron and thereby regulates salt-water homeostasis and blood pressure. To define the role of GRP170 - and, more generally, molecular chaperones in kidney physiology - we developed an inducible, nephron-specific GRP170-KO mouse. Here, we show that GRP170 deficiency causes a dramatic phenotype: profound hypovolemia, hyperaldosteronemia, and dysregulation of ion homeostasis, all of which are associated with the loss of ENaC. Additionally, the GRP170-KO mouse exhibits hallmarks of acute kidney injury (AKI). We further demonstrate that the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in the GRP170-deficient mouse. Notably, the UPR is also activated in AKI when originating from various other etiologies, including ischemia, sepsis, glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and transplant rejection. Our work establishes the central role of GRP170 in kidney homeostasis and directly links molecular chaperone function to kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Update on the Features and Measurements of Experimental Acute Lung Injury in Animals: An Official American Thoracic Society Workshop Report</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35103557/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35103557/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advancements in methods, technology, and our understanding of the pathobiology of lung injury have created the need to update the definition of experimental acute lung injury (ALI). We queried 50 participants with expertise in ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome using a Delphi method composed of a series of electronic surveys and a virtual workshop. We propose that ALI presents as a &amp;ldquo;multidimensional entity&amp;rdquo; characterized by four &amp;ldquo;domains&amp;rdquo; that reflect the key pathophysiologic features and underlying biology of human acute respiratory distress syndrome. These domains are 1) histological evidence of tissue injury, 2) alteration of the alveolar-capillary barrier, 3) presence of an inflammatory response, and 4) physiologic dysfunction. For each domain, we present &amp;ldquo;relevant measurements,&amp;rdquo; defined as those proposed by at least 30% of respondents. We propose that experimental ALI encompasses a continuum of models ranging from those focusing on gaining specific mechanistic insights to those primarily concerned with preclinical testing of novel therapeutics or interventions. We suggest that mechanistic studies may justifiably focus on a single domain of lung injury, but models must document alterations of at least three of the four domains to qualify as &amp;ldquo;experimental ALI.&amp;rdquo; Finally, we propose that a time criterion defining &amp;ldquo;acute&amp;rdquo; in ALI remains relevant, but the actual time may vary based on the specific model and the aspect of injury being modeled. The continuum concept of ALI increases the flexibility and applicability of the definition to multiple models while increasing the likelihood of translating preclinical findings to critically ill patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Severe dysphonia or peripheral facial paralysis after TC-TAVR can be related to CNI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These injuries are likely avoidable by a meticulous surgical dissection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TAVR team must be aware of this setback to prevent it and inform the patient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; No data exist about cranial nerve injury (CNI) as a potential complication of transcarotid (TC) transcatheter valve replacement (TAVR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; This monocentric study included 318 consecutive patients undergoing TC-TAVR from May 2015 to August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CNI occurred in 7 (2.2%) TAVR-TC patients. Five out of the 7 patients (71.4%) had an injury of the laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve, and 2 patients (28.6%) had an injury of the facial nerve. The majority of patients were male (85.7%), with high body mass index (35.6 (IQR: 30.1-37.3) kg/m2). The induced disabilities were clinically important especially for patients with dysphonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; CNI is a potential complication of TC-TAVR likely avoidable by a meticulous surgical technique. Structural heart teams must be aware of this serious setback.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>m6A modifications regulate intestinal immunity and rotavirus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35098923/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant mRNA modification and affects many biological processes. However, how m6A levels are regulated during physiological or pathological processes such as virus infections, and the in vivo function of m6A in the intestinal immune defense against virus infections are largely unknown. Here, we uncover a novel antiviral function of m6A modification during rotavirus (RV) infection in small bowel intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). We found that rotavirus infection induced global m6A modifications on mRNA transcripts by down-regulating the m6a eraser ALKBH5. Mice lacking the m6A writer enzymes METTL3 in IECs (&lt;em&gt;Mettl3&lt;/em&gt;ΔIEC) were resistant to RV infection and showed increased expression of interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Using RNA-sequencing and m6A RNA immuno-precipitation (RIP)-sequencing, we identified IRF7, a master regulator of IFN responses, as one of the primary m6A targets during virus infection. In the absence of METTL3, IECs showed increased &lt;em&gt;Irf7&lt;/em&gt; mRNA stability and enhanced type I and III IFN expression. Deficiency in IRF7 attenuated the elevated expression of IFNs and ISGs and restored susceptibility to RV infection in &lt;em&gt;Mettl3&lt;/em&gt;ΔIEC mice. Moreover, the global m6A modification on mRNA transcripts declined with age in mice, with a significant drop from 2 weeks to 3 weeks post birth, which likely has broad implications for the development of intestinal immune system against enteric viruses early in life. Collectively, we demonstrated a novel host m6A-IRF7-IFN antiviral signaling cascade that restricts rotavirus infection &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rational design of stable heptamethine cyanines and development of a biomarker-activatable probe for detecting acute lung/kidney injuries via NIR-II fluorescence imaging</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing high-quality dyes to construct activatable probes for analyte sensing via NIR-II fluorescence is critical for attaining enhanced imaging depths and resolution. Heptamethine cyanines can serve this purpose; however, they usually have poor stability and a tendency to self-aggregate. Herein, we present a design strategy involving the installation of pyridinium and tert-butyl groups onto the central cyclohexenyl core to increase steric crowding, enhance water solubility, and provide a site for the incorporation of analyte-responsive elements. The resulting NP-N dyes emit NIR-II light and can outperform benchmark heptamethine cyanines such as ICG. Using HP-N1, we developed HP-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and showed that NIR-II fluorescence signals could be enhanced when treating with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. HP-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was subsequently evaluated in murine models of acute lung injury and acute kidney injury. This strategy unlocks the potential of heptamethine cyanines and is applicable to examples with extended conjugation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pharmacologic ACE-Inhibition Mitigates Radiation-Induced Pneumonitis by Suppressing ACE-Expressing Lung Myeloid Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35093482/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced lung injury is a major dose-limiting toxicity for thoracic radiation therapy patients. In experimental models, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors mitigates radiation pneumonitis; however, the mechanism of action is not well understood. Here, we evaluate the direct role of ACE inhibition on lung immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and materials:&lt;/em&gt; ACE expression and activity were determined in the lung immune cell compartment of irradiated adult rats after either high dose fractionated radiation therapy to the right lung (5 fractions × 9 Gy) or a single dose of 13.5 Gy partial body irradiation. Mitigation of radiation-induced pneumonitis with the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril was evaluated in the 13.5 Gy rat partial body irradiation model. During pneumonitis, we characterized inflammation and immune cell content in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In vitro mechanistic studies were performed using primary human monocytes and the human monocytic THP-1 cell line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In both the partial body irradiation and fractionated radiation therapy models, radiation increased ACE activity in lung immune cells. Treatment with lisinopril improved survival during radiation pneumonitis (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .0004). Lisinopril abrogated radiation-induced increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (chemokine ligand 2) and MIP-1a cytokine levels (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .0001). Treatment with lisinopril reduced both ACE expression (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .006) and frequency of CD45+ CD11b+ lung myeloid cells (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .004). In vitro, radiation injury acutely increased ACE activity (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .045) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .004) in human monocytes, whereas treatment with lisinopril blocked radiation-induced increases in both ACE and ROS. Radiation-induced ROS generation was blocked by pharmacologic inhibition of either NADPH oxidase 2 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .012) or the type 1 angiotensin receptor (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These data demonstrate radiation-induced ACE activation within the immune compartment promotes the pathogenesis of radiation pneumonitis, while ACE inhibition suppresses activation of proinflammatory immune cell subsets. Mechanistically, our in vitro data demonstrate radiation directly activates the ACE/type 1 angiotensin receptor pathway in immune cells and promotes generation of ROS via NADPH oxidase 2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human genetic and immunological determinants of critical COVID-19 pneumonia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35090163/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection is benign in most individuals but, in around 10% of cases, it triggers hypoxaemic COVID-19 pneumonia, which leads to critical illness in around 3% of cases. The ensuing risk of death (approximately 1% across age and gender) doubles every five years from childhood onwards and is around 1.5 times greater in men than in women. Here we review the molecular and cellular determinants of critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Inborn errors of type I interferons (IFNs), including autosomal TLR3 and X-chromosome-linked TLR7 deficiencies, are found in around 1-5% of patients with critical pneumonia under 60 years old, and a lower proportion in older patients. Pre-existing auto-antibodies neutralizing IFNα, IFNβ and/or IFNω, which are more common in men than in women, are found in approximately 15-20% of patients with critical pneumonia over 70 years old, and a lower proportion in younger patients. Thus, at least 15% of cases of critical COVID-19 pneumonia can be explained. The TLR3- and TLR7-dependent production of type I IFNs by respiratory epithelial cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, respectively, is essential for host defence against SARS-CoV-2. In ways that can depend on age and sex, insufficient type I IFN immunity in the respiratory tract during the first few days of infection may account for the spread of the virus, leading to pulmonary and systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aggravation of pulmonary fibrosis after knocking down the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35083738/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating disease with multiple contributing factors. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), with a reciprocal function to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), is involved in airway inflammation. The exact relationship between IGF1R and AhR in lung fibrogenesis is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the cascade pathway involving IGF1R and AhR in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental approach:&lt;/em&gt; The AhR and IGF1R expressions were determined in the lungs of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and in a rodent fibrosis model. Pulmonary fibrosis was evaluated in bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury in wild type and AhR knockout (Ahr-/- ) mice. The effects of IGF1R inhibition and AhR activation in vitro on TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Beas2B cells and in vivo on BLM-exposed mice were also examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key results:&lt;/em&gt; There were increased IGF1R levels but AhR expression decreased in the lung of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and BLM-induced mice. Knockout of AhR aggravated lung fibrosis, while the use of IGF1R inhibitor and AhR agonist significantly attenuated such effects and inhibited TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in Beas2B cells. Both TGF-β1 and BLM markedly suppressed AhR expression through endoplasmic reticulum stress and consequently, IGF1R activation. The IGF1R inhibitor and specific knockdown of IGF1R reversed the activation of the TGF-β1 signal pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion and implications:&lt;/em&gt; In the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, AhR and IGF1R play opposite roles via the TGF-β/Smad/STAT signalling cascade. The AhR/IGF1R axis is a potential target for the treatment of lung injury and fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DL0805-1, a novel Rho-kinase inhibitor, attenuates lung injury and vasculopathy in a rat model of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35092757/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a severe chronic cardiopulmonary dysfunction characterized by impaired of pulmonary circulation. Current therapeutic drugs mainly act as vasodilators, leading to an unsatisfactory prognosis. The Rho/ROCK pathway plays an important role in the cardiovascular system. DL0805-1, a novel Rho kinase inhibitor, synthesized by our institute and showed a protective effect on lung tissues and reduced right ventricular systolic pressure in a hypertensive crisis rat model in our previous study. The present study aims to explore the efficacy of DL0805-1 on PH. The classical PH rat model induced by a single subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline was used to investigate the therapeutic effect of DL0805-1 on PH and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that the high dose of DL0805-1 had a better effect on the survival rate and controlled right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) of PH rats than fasudil. DL0805-1 also exhibited a superior lung protective effect and significantly improved pulmonary vascular function compared with bosentan. Regarding molecular mechanisms, DL0805-1 inhibited the ROCK pathway in both pulmonary arteries and lung tissues. Taken together, DL0805-1 alleviated lung injury and vasculopathy in experimental PH rats. DL0805-1 has the potential to be developed as a candidate drug for the treatment of PH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects in vitro and in vivo of hesperidin administration in an experimental model of acute lung inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35092853/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a tool used in critical patient care. However, it can trigger inflammatory and oxidative processes capable of causing or aggravating lung injuries, which is known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Hesperidin is a flavonoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in various diseases. The role of hesperidin in the process triggered by MV is poorly studied. Thus, we hypothesize hesperidin could protect the lung of mice submitted to mechanical ventilation. For that, we evaluated cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in macrophages using different hesperidin concentrations. We observed hesperidin did not reduce cell viability, however; it attenuated the production of intracellular ROS in cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We further evaluated the effects of hesperidin in vivo in animals submitted to MV. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, there were higher levels of macrophage, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts in animals submitted to MV, indicating an inflammatory process. In the lung tissue, MV induced oxidative damage and increased myeloperoxidase activity, though the antioxidant enzyme activity decreased. MV also induced the production of the inflammatory mediators CCL-2, TNF-α and IL-12. Pretreatment with hesperidin resulted in less recruitment of inflammatory cells to the airways and less oxidative damage. Also, it reduced the formation of CCL-2 and IL-12. Our results show pretreatment with hesperidin can protect the lungs of mice submitted to mechanical ventilation by modulating the inflammatory response and redox imbalance and may act to prevent MV injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicle-mediated cellular crosstalk in lung repair, remodelling and regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35082125/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unperturbed lung is highly quiescent, with a remarkably low level of cell turnover. However, once damaged, the lung shows an extensive regenerative capacity, with resident progenitor cell populations re-entering the cell cycle and differentiating to promote repair. This quick and dramatic repair response requires interactions among more than 40 different cell lineages in the lung, and defects in any of these processes can lead to various lung pathologies. Understanding the mechanisms of interaction in lung injury, repair and regeneration thus has considerable practical and therapeutic implications. Moreover, therapeutic strategies for replacing lung progenitor cells and their progeny through cell therapy have gained increasing attention. In the last decade, extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, have been recognised as paracrine mediators through the transfer of biological cargo. Recent work has revealed that EVs are involved in lung homeostasis and diseases. In addition, EVs derived from specific cells or tissues have proven to be a promising cell-free modality for the treatment of lung diseases. This review highlights the EV-mediated cellular crosstalk that regulates lung homeostasis and discusses the potential of EV therapeutics for lung regenerative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genetic inactivation of Semaphorin 3C protects mice from acute kidney injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To guide the development of therapeutic interventions for acute kidney injury, elucidating the deleterious pathways of this global health problem is highly warranted. Emerging evidence has indicated a pivotal role of endothelial dysfunction in the etiology of this disease. We found that the class III semaphorin SEMA3C was ectopically upregulated with full length protein excreted into the blood and truncated protein secreted into the urine upon kidney injury and hypothesized a role for SEAM3C in acute kidney injury. Sema3c was genetically abrogated during acute kidney injury and subsequent kidney morphological and functional defects in two well-characterized models of acute kidney injury; warm ischemia/reperfusion and folic acid injection were analyzed. Employing a beta actin-dependent, inducible knockout of Sema3c, we demonstrate that in acute kidney injury SEMA3C promotes interstitial edema, leucocyte infiltration and tubular injury. Additionally, intravital microscopy combined with Evans Blue dye extravasation and primary culture of magnetically sorted peritubular endothelial cells identified a novel role for SEMA3C in promoting vascular permeability. Thus, our study points to microvascular permeability as an important driver of injury in acute kidney injury, and to SEMA3C as a novel permeability factor and potential target for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-15p-5p Mediates the Coordination of ICAM-1 and FAK to Promote Endothelial Cell Proliferation and Migration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35079920/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in endothelial cells is critical for neutrophil adhesion and transmigration across the endothelium. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which controls the turnover of focal adhesion to regulate cell adhesion and migration, plays a role in the resolution of inflammation. However, the coordinated involvement of ICAM-1 and FAK during endothelial inflammation has yet to be elucidated. This study reports that, as part of an inflammatory response, ICAM-1 controls FAK expression in endothelial cells via the microRNA miR-15b-5p. Induction of lung injury by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in higher levels of FAK expression in inflammatory tissues, while in ICAM-1 knockout mice, FAK expression was reduced in the lungs. FAK expression was also reduced in endothelial cells following ICAM-1 siRNA downregulation. Furthermore, ICAM-1 inhibited miR-15b-5p expression while increasing FAK mRNA and protein expression via binding of miR-15b-5p to the 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated region (UTR) of FAK. ICAM-1 inhibited miR-15b-5p promoter activity and hence reduced miR-15b-5p expression. FAK increased endothelial cell proliferation and migration, whereas miR-15b-5p inhibited cell proliferation and migration. These findings indicate that the inflammatory molecule ICAM-1 regulates FAK expression via miR-15b-5p levels, which in turn controls endothelial cell proliferation and migration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA regulatory molecules that play an important role in the development and function of immune cells. MicroRNA-26a (miR-26a) exhibits anti-inflammatory immune effects on immune cells. However, the exact mechanism by which miR-26a plays an anti-inflammatory role remains unclear. Here, we report that miR-26a reduces inflammatory response via inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by targeting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We found that miR-26a was downregulated in vitro and in vivo. The miR-26a mimic significantly decreased COX-2 protein levels, further inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We predicted that miR-26a could potentially target COX-2 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Computational algorithms showed that the 3&amp;rsquo;-UTR of COX-2 mRNA contains a binding site for miR-26a. This putative targeting relationship between miR-26a and COX-2 was further confirmed by a dual-reporter gene assay. The anti-inflammatory effects of the miR-26a mimic were diminished by PGE2 supplementation. Importantly, miR-26a mimics protected mice from lethal endotoxic shock and attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Collectively, these results suggest that miR-26a may function as a novel feedback negative regulator of the hyperinflammatory response and as a drug target for the progression of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel nordihydroguaiaretic acid analog, compound 3a, alleviates acute lung injury by exerting antiapoptotic and antiinflammatory effects</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a continuum of pulmonary changes caused by various lung insults. Previously, we synthesized a series of nordihydroguaiaretic acid analogs; of these, compound 3a exhibited excellent antioxidant capacity in a murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. However, it remains unclear whether compound 3a can modulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. ALI was induced via tracheal LPS administration, and the pathological changes were assessed. The level of inflammation was verified by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses. Apoptosis was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assays and Western blotting. Changes in the levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway proteins were assessed by immunofluorescence assays and Western blotting. In vitro, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with compound 3a prior to LPS challenge, and the intracellular level of inflammation was assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Relevant proteins were detected via immunofluorescence assays and Western blotting. Mice developed extensive lung inflammation by 24 h after LPS challenge. Histological examination revealed signs typical of ALI. Preadministration of compound 3a markedly ameliorated the histopathological changes and reduced fluid exudation into the alveolar space. Compound 3a also greatly reduced the levels of inflammation and apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, compound 3a markedly reduced phosphorylation of MAPK/NF-κB pathway-related proteins and p65 translocation, consistent with the in vitro observations. In summary, administration of compound 3a prior to LPS suppressed ALI via inhibition of the MAPK/NF-κB pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cell Origin and iNOS Function Are Critical to Macrophage Activation Following Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35145401/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the intratracheal bleomycin (ITB) model of acute lung injury (ALI), macrophages are recruited to the lung and participate in the inflammation and resolution that follows injury. Macrophage origin is influential in determining activation; however, the specific phenotype of recruited and resident macrophages is not known. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALI; however, the effects of its inhibition are mixed. Here we examined how macrophage origin determines the phenotypic response to ALI. Further, we hypothesize cell specific iNOS is key to determining activation and recruitment. Using a chimeric mouse approach, we have identified recruited and resident macrophage populations. We also used the chimeric mouse approach to create either pulmonary or bone marrow NOS2-/- mice and systemically inhibited iNOS via 1400 W. We evaluated macrophage populations at the peak of inflammation (8 days) and the beginning of resolution (15 days) following ITB. These studies demonstrate tissue resident macrophages adopt a M2 phenotype specifically, but monocyte originated macrophages activate along a spectrum. Additionally, we demonstrated that monocyte originating macrophage derived iNOS is responsible for recruitment to the lung during the inflammatory phase. Further, we show that macrophage activation is dependent upon cellular origin. Finally, these studies suggest pulmonary derived iNOS is detrimental to the lung following ITB. In conclusion, macrophage origin is a key determinant in response to ALI and iNOS is central to recruitment and activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Platelets Derived Transthyretin Participate in The Development of Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury by Inducing Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis of Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35081075/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathophysiology of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is not well elucidated. Platelets have been reported to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AKI, but the true mechanism remains unknown. Herein, we established a mouse model of S-AKI by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Ticagrelor was given 24 h before and after CLP by gastric gavage. Platelets were isolated and analyzed by the label-free proteome approach to identify platelet-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Our results demonstrated that, among all differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), platelet-derived transthyretin (TTR) exerted effects in S-AKI. To examine the direct effects of platelet TTR on human renal proximal tubule epithelial (HK2) cells damage, platelets were co-cultured with HK2 cells. The results indicated that platelet TTR can cause reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis in HK2 cells. Further research found that platelet TTR can also result in increased levels of mRNA and protein for protein kinase B (AKT), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), as analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting. In conclusion, platelet-derived TTR may be one kind of DAMPs that plays an important role in the development of S-AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kidney Histopathology Can Predict Kidney Function in ANCA-Associated Vasculitides with Acute Kidney Injury Treated with Plasma Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35074934/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Data from the PEXIVAS trial challenged the role of plasma exchange (PLEX) in ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV). We aimed to describe kidney biopsy from patients with AAV treated with PLEX, evaluate whether histopathologic findings could predict kidney function, and identify which patients would most benefit from PLEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We performed a multicenter, retrospective study on 188 patients with AAV and AKI treated with PLEX and 237 not treated with PLEX. The primary outcome was mortality or KRT at 12 months (M12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; No significant benefit of PLEX for the primary outcome was found. To identify patients benefitting from PLEX, we developed a model predicting the average treatment effect of PLEX for an individual depending on covariables. Using the prediction model, 223 patients had a better predicted outcome with PLEX than without PLEX, and 177 of them had &amp;gt;5% increased predicted probability with PLEX compared with without PLEX of being alive and free from KRT at M12, which defined the PLEX-recommended group. Risk difference for death or KRT at M12 was significantly lower with PLEX in the PLEX-recommended group (-15.9%; 95% CI, -29.4 to -2.5) compared with the PLEX not recommended group (-4.8%; 95% CI, 14.9 to 5.3). Microscopic polyangiitis, MPO-ANCA, higher serum creatinine, crescentic and sclerotic classes, and higher Brix score were more frequent in the PLEX-recommended group. An easy to use score identified patients who would benefit from PLEX. The average treatment effect of PLEX for those with recommended treatment corresponded to an absolute risk reduction for death or KRT at M12 of 24.6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; PLEX was not associated with a better primary outcome in the whole study population, but we identified a subset of patients who could benefit from PLEX. However, these findings must be validated before utilized in clinical decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Renal Nano-drug delivery for acute kidney Injury: Current status and future perspectives</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35085695/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) causes considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in the case of post-cardiac infarction or kidney transplantation; however, the site-specific accumulation of small molecule reno-protective agents for AKI has often proved ineffective due to dynamic fluid and solute excretion and non-selectivity, which impedes therapeutic efficacy. This article reviews the current status and future trajectories of renal nanomedicine research for AKI management from pharmacological and clinical perspectives, with a particular focus on appraising nanosized drug carrier (NDC) use for the delivery of reno-protective agents of different pharmacological classes and the effectiveness of NDCs in improving renal tissue targeting selectivity and efficacy of said agents. This review reveals the critical shift in the role of the small molecule reno-protective agents in AKI pharmacotherapy - from prophylaxis to treatment - when using NDCs for delivery to the kidney. We also highlight the need to identify the accumulation sites of NDCs carrying reno-protective agents in renal tissues during in vivo assessments and detail the less-explored pharmacological classes of reno-protective agents whose efficacies may be improved via NDC-based delivery. We conclude the paper by outlining the challenges and future perspectives of NDC-based reno-protective agent delivery for better clinical management of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-Cell RNA Sequencing-Based Characterization of Resident Lung Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35445270/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late lung development is a period of alveolar and microvascular formation, which is pivotal in ensuring sufficient and effective gas exchange. Defects in late lung development manifest in premature infants as a chronic lung disease named bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Numerous studies demonstrated the therapeutic properties of exogenous bone marrow and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in experimental BPD. However, very little is known regarding the regenerative capacity of resident lung MSCs (L-MSCs) during normal development and in BPD. In this study we aimed to characterize the L-MSC population in homeostasis and upon injury. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile in situ Ly6a+ L-MSCs in the lungs of normal and O2-exposed neonatal mice (a well-established model to mimic BPD) at 3 developmental timepoints (postnatal days 3, 7, and 14). Hyperoxia exposure increased the number and altered the expression profile of L-MSCs, particularly by increasing the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and anti-angiogenic genes. In order to identify potential changes induced in the L-MSCs transcriptome by storage and culture, we profiled 15 000 Ly6a+ L-MSCs after in vitro culture. We observed great differences in expression profiles of in situ and cultured L-MSCs, particularly those derived from healthy lungs. Additionally, we have identified the location of Ly6a+/Col14a1+ L-MSCs in the developing lung and propose Serpinf1 as a novel, culture-stable marker of L-MSCs. Finally, cell communication analysis suggests inflammatory signals from immune and endothelial cells as main drivers of hyperoxia-induced changes in L-MSCs transcriptome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>H2 Inhibits the Formation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35257042/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NETs have been implicated as therapeutic targets to address inflammation and thrombotic tissue damage in conditions such as sepsis, acute respiratory disease syndrome, COVID-19, and CVDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been clinically and experimentally proven to ameliorate inflammation; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared with control neutrophils, PMA-stimulated human neutrophils exposed to H2 exhibited reduced citrullination of histones and release of NET components; mechanistically, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated neutralization of HOCl produced during oxidative bursts suppresses DNA damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inhalation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhibited the formation and release of NET components in the blood and BAL of the LPS-induced sepsis in mice and aged mini pigs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; therapy is potentially a new therapeutic strategy for inflammatory diseases involving NETs associated with excessive neutrophil activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to inflammatory pathogenesis in numerous conditions, including infectious and cardiovascular diseases, and have attracted attention as potential therapeutic targets. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as an antioxidant and has been clinically and experimentally proven to ameliorate inflammation. This study was performed to investigate whether H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could inhibit NET formation and excessive neutrophil activation. Neutrophils isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers were stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or the calcium ionophore A23187 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed or control media. Compared with control neutrophils, PMA- or A23187-stimulated human neutrophils exposed to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited reduced neutrophil aggregation, citrullination of histones, membrane disruption by chromatin complexes, and release of NET components. CXCR4&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; neutrophils are highly prone to NETs, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; suppressed Ser-139 phosphorylation in H2AX, a marker of DNA damage, thereby suppressing the induction of CXCR4 expression. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; suppressed both myeloperoxidase chlorination activity and production of reactive oxygen species to the same degree as N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid, while showing a more potent ability to inhibit NET formation than these antioxidants do in PMA-stimulated neutrophils. Although A23187 formed NETs in a reactive oxygen species-independent manner, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhibited A23187-induced NET formation, probably via direct inhibition of peptidyl arginine deiminase 4-mediated histone citrullination. Inhalation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhibited the formation and release of NET components in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in animal models of lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis (mice and aged mini pigs). Thus, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; therapy can be a novel therapeutic strategy for NETs associated with excessive neutrophil activation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of Klotho, an anti-aging protein, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney diseases. As Klotho is a large transmembrane protein, it is challenging to harness it as a therapeutic remedy. Here we report the discovery of a Klotho-derived peptide 1 (KP1) protecting kidneys by targeting TGF-β signaling. By screening a series of peptides derived from human Klotho protein, we identified KP1 that repressed fibroblast activation by binding to TGF-β receptor 2 (TβR2) and disrupting the TGF-β/TβR2 engagement. As such, KP1 blocked TGF-β-induced activation of Smad2/3 and mitogen-activated protein kinases. In mouse models of renal fibrosis, intravenous injection of KP1 resulted in its preferential accumulation in injured kidneys. KP1 preserved kidney function, repressed TGF-β signaling, ameliorated renal fibrosis and restored endogenous Klotho expression. Together, our findings suggest that KP1 recapitulates the anti-fibrotic action of Klotho and offers a potential remedy in the fight against fibrotic kidney diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inhaled long-acting β-adrenergic agonists (LABAs) and short-acting β-adrenergic agonists are approved for the treatment of obstructive lung disease via actions mediated by β2 adrenergic receptors (β2-ARs) that increase cellular cAMP synthesis. This review discusses the potential of β2-AR agonists, in particular LABAs, for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We emphasize ARDS induced by pneumonia and focus on the pathobiology of ARDS and actions of LABAs and cAMP on pulmonary and immune cell types. β2-AR agonists/cAMP have beneficial actions that include protection of epithelial and endothelial cells from injury, restoration of alveolar fluid clearance, and reduction of fibrotic remodeling. β2-AR agonists/cAMP also exert anti-inflammatory effects on the immune system by actions on several types of immune cells. Early administration is likely critical for optimizing efficacy of LABAs or other cAMP-elevating agents, such as agonists of other Gs-coupled G protein-coupled receptors or cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Clinical studies that target lung injury early, prior to development of ARDS, are thus needed to further assess the use of inhaled LABAs, perhaps combined with inhaled corticosteroids and/or long-acting muscarinic cholinergic antagonists. Such agents may provide a multipronged, repurposing, and efficacious therapeutic approach while minimizing systemic toxicity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after pulmonary alveolar injury (e.g., certain viral infections) is associated with ∼40% mortality and in need of new therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the pathobiology of ARDS, focusing on contributions of pulmonary and immune cell types and potentially beneficial actions of β2 adrenergic receptors and cAMP. Early administration of inhaled β2 adrenergic agonists and perhaps other cAMP-elevating agents after alveolar injury may be a prophylactic approach to prevent development of ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cigarette Smoke Exposure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Sepsis: Epidemiology, Clinical Features, and Biologic Markers</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35050845/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Cigarette smoke exposure is associated with an increased risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in trauma, transfusion, and nonpulmonary sepsis. It is unknown whether this relationship exists in the general sepsis population. Furthermore, it is unknown if patients with ARDS have differences in underlying biology based on smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; To assess the relationship between cigarette smoke exposure and ARDS in sepsis and identify tobacco-related biomarkers of lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We studied a prospective cohort of 592 patients with sepsis from 2009 to 2017. Plasma cotinine and urine NNAL [urine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol] were measured to categorize smoking status. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation and lung injury were measured, including in a smaller cohort of trauma patients with ARDS to increase generalizability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/em&gt; Passive and active smoking were associated with increased odds of developing ARDS in patients with sepsis. Among patients with sepsis and ARDS, active cigarette smokers were younger and had lower severity of illness than nonsmokers. Patients with ARDS with cigarette smoke exposure had lower plasma levels of IL-8 (P = 0.01) and sTNFR-1 (soluble tumor necrosis factor 1; P = 0.01) compared with those without exposure. Similar biomarker patterns were observed in blunt trauma patients with ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Passive and active smoking are associated with an increased risk of developing ARDS in patients with pulmonary and nonpulmonary sepsis. Among patients with ARDS, those with cigarette smoke exposure have less systemic inflammation, while active smokers also have lower severity of illness compared with nonsmokers, suggesting that smoking contributes to biological heterogeneity in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coal dust exposure triggers heterogeneity of transcriptional profiles in mouse pneumoconiosis and Vitamin D remedies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35057792/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35057792/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Coal dust particles (CDP), an inevitable by-product of coal mining for the environment, mainly causes coal workers&amp;rsquo; pneumoconiosis (CWP). Long-term exposure to coal dust leads to a complex alternation of biological processes during regeneration and repair in the healing lung. However, the cellular and complete molecular changes associated with pulmonary homeostasis caused by respiratory coal dust particles remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; This study mainly investigated the pulmonary toxicity of respirable-sized CDP in mice using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing. CDP (&amp;lt; 5 μm) collected from the coal mine was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Mass Spectrometer. In addition, western blotting, Elisa, QPCR was used to detect gene expression at mRNA or protein levels. Pathological analysis including HE staining, Masson staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to characterize the structure and functional alternation in the pneumoconiosis mouse and verify the reliability of single-cell sequencing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; SEM image and Mass Spectrometer analysis showed that coal dust particles generated during coal mine production have been crushed and screened with a diameter of less than 5 µm and contained less than 10% silica. Alveolar structure and pulmonary microenvironment were destroyed, inflammatory and death (apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis) pathways were activated, leading to pneumoconiosis in post 9 months coal dust stimulation. A distinct abnormally increased alveolar type 2 epithelial cell (AT2) were classified with a highly active state but reduced the antimicrobial-related protein expression of LYZ and Chia1 after CDP exposure. Beclin1, LC3B, LAMP2, TGF-ß, and MLPH were up-regulated induced by CDP, promoting autophagy and pulmonary fibrosis. A new subset of macrophages with M2-type polarization double expressed MLPH + /CD206 + was found in mice having pneumoconiosis but markedly decreased after the Vitamin D treatment. Activated MLPH + /CD206 + M2 macrophages secreted TGF-β1 and are sensitive to Vitamin D treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This is the first study to reconstruct the pathologic progression and transcriptome pattern of coal pneumoconiosis in mice. Coal dust had obvious toxic effects on lung epithelial cells and macrophages and eventually induced pulmonary fibrosis. CDP-induced M2-type macrophages could be inhibited by VD, which may be related to the alleviation of the pulmonary fibrosis process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MICU1-dependent mitochondrial calcium uptake regulates lung alveolar type 2 cell plasticity and lung regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35050901/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells are progenitors for alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells. Although many factors regulate AT2 cell plasticity, the role of mitochondrial calcium (&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) uptake in controlling AT2 cells remains unclear. We previously identified that the miR-302 family supports lung epithelial progenitor cell proliferation and less differentiated phenotypes during development. Here, we report that a sustained elevation of miR-302 in adult AT2 cells decreases AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation during the Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced lung injury repair. We identified that miR-302 targets and represses the expression of mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake 1 (MICU1), which regulates &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake through the &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uniporter channel by acting as a gatekeeper at low cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. Our results reveal a marked increase in MICU1 protein expression and decreased &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake during AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation in the adult lung. Deletion of &lt;em&gt;Micu1&lt;/em&gt; in AT2 cells reduces AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation during steady-state tissue maintenance and alveolar epithelial regeneration after bacterial pneumonia. These studies indicate that &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake is extensively modulated during AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation and that MICU1-dependent &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uniporter channel gating is a prominent mechanism modulating AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypoxia Increases the Potential for Neutrophil-mediated Endothelial Damage in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35044899/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35044899/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and exacerbations further increase the risk of such events. COPD is associated with persistent blood and airway neutrophilia and systemic and tissue hypoxia. Hypoxia augments neutrophil elastase release, enhancing capacity for tissue injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To determine whether hypoxia-driven neutrophil protein secretion contributes to endothelial damage in COPD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The healthy human neutrophil secretome generated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions was characterized by quantitative mass spectrometry, and the capacity for neutrophil-mediated endothelial damage was assessed. Histotoxic protein concentrations were measured in normoxic versus hypoxic neutrophil supernatants and plasma from patients experiencing COPD exacerbation and healthy control subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/em&gt; Hypoxia promoted PI3Kγ-dependent neutrophil elastase secretion, with greater release seen in neutrophils from patients with COPD. Supernatants from neutrophils incubated under hypoxia caused pulmonary endothelial cell damage, and identical supernatants from COPD neutrophils increased neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells. Proteomics revealed differential neutrophil protein secretion under hypoxia and normoxia, and hypoxia augmented secretion of a subset of histotoxic granule and cytosolic proteins, with significantly greater release seen in COPD neutrophils. The plasma of patients with COPD had higher content of hypoxia-upregulated neutrophil-derived proteins and protease activity, and vascular injury markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Hypoxia drives a destructive &amp;ldquo;hypersecretory&amp;rdquo; neutrophil phenotype conferring enhanced capacity for endothelial injury, with a corresponding signature of neutrophil degranulation and vascular injury identified in plasma of patients with COPD. Thus, hypoxic enhancement of neutrophil degranulation may contribute to increased cardiovascular risk in COPD. These insights may identify new therapeutic opportunities for endothelial damage in COPD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myeloid mineralocorticoid receptors contribute to skeletal muscle repair in muscular dystrophy and acute muscle injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35044859/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppressing mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activity with MR antagonists is therapeutic for chronic skeletal muscle pathology in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mouse models. Although mechanisms underlying clinical MR antagonist efficacy for DMD cardiomyopathy and other cardiac diseases are defined, mechanisms in skeletal muscles are not fully elucidated. Myofiber MR knockout improves skeletal muscle force and a subset of dystrophic pathology. However, MR signaling in myeloid cells is known to be a major contributor to cardiac efficacy. To define contributions of myeloid MR in skeletal muscle function and disease, we performed parallel assessments of muscle pathology, cytokine levels, and myeloid cell populations resulting from myeloid MR genetic knockout in muscular dystrophy and acute muscle injury. Myeloid MR knockout led to lower levels of C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-expressing macrophages, resulting in sustained myofiber damage after acute injury of normal muscle. In acute injury, myeloid MR knockout also led to increased local muscle levels of the enzyme that produces the endogenous MR agonist aldosterone, further supporting important contributions of MR signaling in normal muscle repair. In muscular dystrophy, myeloid MR knockout altered cytokine levels differentially between quadriceps and diaphragm muscles, which contain different myeloid populations. Myeloid MR knockout led to higher levels of fibrosis in dystrophic diaphragm. These results support important contributions of myeloid MR signaling to skeletal muscle repair in acute and chronic injuries and highlight the useful information gained from cell-specific genetic knockouts to delineate mechanisms of pharmacological efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BMSC-Derived Exosomes Carrying lncRNA-ZFAS1 Alleviate Pulmonary Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by UPF1-Mediated mRNA Decay of FOXD1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36652050/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) exert protective effects against pulmonary ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury; however, the potential mechanism involved in their protective ability remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to explore the function and underlying mechanism of BMSC-derived exosomal lncRNA-ZFAS1 in pulmonary I/R injury. Pulmonary I/R injury models were established in mice and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-exposed primary mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMECs). Exosomes were extracted from BMSCs. Target molecule expression was assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Pathological changes in the lungs, pulmonary edema, apoptosis, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, SOD, MPO activities, and MDA level were measured. The proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of LMECs were detected by CCK-8, EdU staining, flow cytometry, and scratch assay. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down, RIP, and ChIP assays were performed to validate the molecular interaction. In the mouse model of pulmonary I/R injury, BMSC-Exos treatment relieved lung pathological injury, reduced lung W/D weight ratio, and restrained apoptosis and inflammation, whereas exosomal ZFAS1 silencing abolished these beneficial effects. In addition, the proliferation, migration inhibition, apoptosis, and inflammation in H/R-exposed LMECs were repressed by BMSC-derived exosomal ZFAS1. Mechanistically, ZFAS1 contributed to FOXD1 mRNA decay via interaction with UPF1, thereby leading to Gal-3 inactivation. Furthermore, FOXD1 depletion strengthened the weakened protective effect of ZFAS1-silenced BMSC-Exos on pulmonary I/R injury. ZFAS1 delivered by BMSC-Exos results in FOXD1 mRNA decay and subsequent Gal-3 inactivation via direct interaction with UPF1, thereby attenuating pulmonary I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clinical Predictors and Long-term Impact of Acute Kidney Injury on Progression of Diabetic Kidney Disease in Chinese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35043149/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to assess the long-term impact of acute kidney injury (AKI) on progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and all-cause mortality and investigate determinants of AKI in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A consecutive cohort of 9,096 Chinese patients with T2D from the Hong Kong Diabetes Register was followed for 12 years (mean ± SD age 57 ± 13.2 years; 46.9% men; median duration of diabetes 5 years). AKI was defined based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria using serum creatinine. Estimated glomerular filtration rate measurements were used to identify the first episode with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Polygenic risk score (PRS) composed of 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with serum uric acid (SUA) in European populations was used to examine the role of SUA in pathogenesis of AKI, CKD, and ESRD. Validation was sought in an independent cohort including 6,007 patients (age 61.2 ± 10.9 years; 59.5% men; median duration of diabetes 10 years). Patients with AKI had a higher risk for developing incident CKD (hazard ratio 14.3 [95% CI 12.69-16.11]), for developing ESRD (12.1 [10.74-13.62]), and for all-cause death (7.99 [7.31-8.74]) compared with those without AKI. Incidence rate for ESRD among patients with no episodes of AKI and one, two, and three or more episodes of AKI was 7.1, 24.4, 32.4, and 37.3 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Baseline SUA was a strong independent predictor for AKI. A PRS composed of 27 SUA-related SNPs was associated with AKI and CKD in both discovery and replication cohorts but not ESRD. Elevated SUA may increase the risk of DKD through increasing AKI. The identification of SUA as a modifiable risk factor and PRS as a nonmodifiable risk factor may facilitate the identification of individuals at high risk to prevent AKI and its long-term impact in T2D.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human Dermcidin Protects Mice Against Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Local and Remote Inflammatory Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35095926/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Hepatic ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury is commonly associated with surgical liver resection or transplantation, and represents a major cause of liver damage and graft failure. Currently, there are no effective therapies to prevent hepatic I/R injury other than ischemic preconditioning and some preventative strategies. Previously, we have revealed the anti-inflammatory activity of a sweat gland-derived peptide, dermcidin (DCD), in macrophage/monocyte cultures. Here, we sought to explore its therapeutic potential and protective mechanisms in a murine model of hepatic I/R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to hepatic ischemia by clamping the hepatic artery and portal vein for 60 min, which was then removed to initiate reperfusion. At the beginning of reperfusion, 0.2 ml saline control or solution of DCD (0.5 mg/kg BW) or DCD-C34S analog (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg BW) containing a Cys (C)→Ser (S) substitution at residue 34 was injected via the internal jugular vein. For survival experiments, mice were subjected to additional resection to remove non-ischemic liver lobes, and animal survival was monitored for 10 days. For mechanistic studies, blood and tissue samples were collected at 24 h after the onset of reperfusion, and subjected to measurements of various markers of inflammation and tissue injury by real-time RT-PCR, immunoassays, and histological analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Recombinant DCD or DCD-C34S analog conferred a significant protection against lethal hepatic I/R when given intravenously at the beginning of reperfusion. This protection was associated with a significant reduction in hepatic injury, neutrophilic CXC chemokine (Mip-2) expression, neutrophil infiltration, and associated inflammation. Furthermore, the administration of DCD also resulted in a significant attenuation of remote lung inflammatory injury. Mechanistically, DCD interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a key regulator of liver inflammation, and significantly inhibited hepatic I/R-induced phosphorylation of EGFR as well as a downstream signaling molecule, protein kinase B (AKT). The suppression of EGFR expression by transducing Egfr-specific shRNA plasmid into macrophages abrogated the DCD-mediated inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production induced by a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), cold-inducible RNA-binding protein, CIRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The present study suggests that human DCD and its analog may be developed as novel therapeutics to attenuate hepatic I/R-induced inflammatory injury possibly by impairing EGFR signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of Rac1 attenuates radiation-induced lung injury while suppresses lung tumor in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lung is one of the most sensitive tissues to ionizing radiation, thus, radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) stays a key dose-limiting factor of thoracic radiotherapy. However, there is still little progress in the effective treatment of RILI. Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate1, Rac1, is a small guanosine triphosphatases involved in oxidative stress and apoptosis. Thus, Rac1 may be an important molecule that mediates radiation damage, inhibition of which may produce a protective effect on RILI. By establishing a mouse model of radiation-induced lung injury and orthotopic lung tumor-bearing mouse model, we detected the role of Rac1 inhibition in the protection of RILI and suppression of lung tumor. The results showed that ionizing radiation induces the nuclear translocation of Rac1, the latter then promotes nuclear translocation of P53 and prolongs the residence time of p53 in the nucleus, thereby promoting the transcription of Trp53inp1 which mediates p53-dependent apoptosis. Inhibition of Rac1 significantly reduce the apoptosis of normal lung epithelial cells, thereby effectively alleviating RILI. On the other hand, inhibition of Rac1 could also significantly inhibit the growth of lung tumor, increase the radiation sensitivity of tumor cells. These differential effects of Rac1 inhibition were related to the mutation and overexpression of Rac1 in tumor cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung emphysema and impaired macrophage elastase clearance in mucolipin 3 deficient mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Excess macrophage elastase MMP-12, which is predominantly secreted from alveolar macrophages, is known to mediate the development of lung injury and emphysema. Here, we discovered the endolysosomal cation channel mucolipin 3 (TRPML3) as a regulator of MMP-12 reuptake from broncho-alveolar fluid, driving in two independently generated &lt;em&gt;Trpml3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mouse models enlarged lung injury, which is further exacerbated after elastase or tobacco smoke treatment. Mechanistically, using a &lt;em&gt;Trpml3&lt;sup&gt;IRES-Cre/eR26-τGFP&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reporter mouse model, transcriptomics, and endolysosomal patch-clamp experiments, we show that in the lung TRPML3 is almost exclusively expressed in alveolar macrophages, where its loss leads to defects in early endosomal trafficking and endocytosis of MMP-12. Our findings suggest that TRPML3 represents a key regulator of MMP-12 clearance by alveolar macrophages and may serve as therapeutic target for emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tissue Culture Models of AKI: From Tubule Cells to Human Kidney Organoids</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35031569/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AKI affects approximately 13.3 million people around the world each year, causing CKD and/or mortality. The mammalian kidney cannot generate new nephrons after postnatal renal damage and regenerative therapies for AKI are not available. Human kidney tissue culture systems can complement animal models of AKI and/or address some of their limitations. Donor-derived somatic cells, such as renal tubule epithelial cells or cell lines (RPTEC/hTERT, ciPTEC, HK-2, Nki-2, and CIHP-1), have been used for decades to permit drug toxicity screening and studies into potential AKI mechanisms. However, tubule cell lines do not fully recapitulate tubular epithelial cell properties in situ when grown under classic tissue culture conditions. Improving tissue culture models of AKI would increase our understanding of the mechanisms, leading to new therapeutics. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be differentiated into kidney organoids and various renal cell types. Injury to human kidney organoids results in renal cell-type crosstalk and upregulation of kidney injury biomarkers that are difficult to induce in primary tubule cell cultures. However, current protocols produce kidney organoids that are not mature and contain off-target cell types. Promising bioengineering techniques, such as bioprinting and &amp;ldquo;kidney-on-a-chip&amp;rdquo; methods, as applied to kidney nephrotoxicity modeling advantages and limitations are discussed. This review explores the mechanisms and detection of AKI in tissue culture, with an emphasis on bioengineered approaches such as human kidney organoid models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An adapted passive model of anti-MPO dependent crescentic glomerulonephritis reveals matrix dysregulation and is amenable to modulation by CXCR4 inhibition</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35032611/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pathway analysis of the gene profiling microarray data demonstrates distinct activation of ECM-associated pathways in AAV patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We established and characterized an adapted and robust anti-MPO antibody-dependent murine AAV model that progresses from acute injury to glomerular and interstitial scarring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our AAV model presents already at the acute phase immune infiltrates, activation of immune cells, response to cytokine production and matrisomal changes that phenocopy very well the human pathology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We identified CXCR4 as an interesting therapeutical target that decreases the activation of immune cells in the acute phase of AAV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We developed and characterized a murine model of FNGN that recapitulates important clinical, histological and molecular features of human renal AAV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our model is suitable for studying chronic scarring injury and matrix remodeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provide a comprehensive analysis of inflammation and altered matrisome expression occurring early in injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We show that our model can be used for pharmacological studies and highlight CXCR4 as a potential target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are severe inflammatory disorders that often involve focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis (FNGN) and consequent glomerular scarring, interstitial fibrosis, and chronic kidney disease. Robust murine models of scarring in FNGN that may help to further our understanding of deleterious processes are still lacking. Here, we present a murine model of severe FNGN based on combined administration of antibodies against the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), that recapitulates acute injury and was adapted to investigate subsequent glomerular and interstitial scarring. Hematuria without involvement of other organs occurs consistently and rapidly, glomerular necrosis and crescent formation are evident at 12 days, and consequent glomerular and interstitial scarring at 29 days after initial treatment. Using mass-spectrometric proteome analysis, we provide a detailed overview of matrisomal and cellular changes in our model. We observed increased expression of the matrisome including collagens, fibronectin, tenascin-C, in accordance with human AAV as deduced from analysis of gene expression microarrays and tissue staining. Moreover, we observed tissue infiltration by neutrophils, macrophages, T cells and myofibroblasts upon injury. Experimental inhibition of CXCR4 using AMD3100 led to a sustained histological presence of fibrin extravasate, reduced chemokine expression and leukocyte activation, but did not markedly affect ECM composition. Altogether, we demonstrate an adapted FNGN model that enables the study of matrisomal changes both in disease and upon intervention, as exemplified via CXCR4 inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dysregulation of mitochondrial complexes and dynamics by chronic cigarette smoke exposure Utilizing MitoQC reporter mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35032706/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cigarette smoke (CS) is known to cause impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dysregulation in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema. Mitochondrial complexes and dynamics are affected by acute CS exposure in lung epithelium and mouse lung. We hypothesize that chronic CS exposure (4 months) will induce lung mitochondrial dysregulation and abnormal mitophagy. In this study, we employed the mitoQC reporter mice, a mitochondrial reporter strain, which can reflect the mitophagy based on the fluorescence-tagged mitochondria. Chronic CS exposure induced lung inflammatory cell infiltration, airspace enlargement, and lung cellular senescence. We showed the higher occurrence of mitophagy (GFP/mCherry) in the lung cells by CS exposure, associated with more mitochondrial fluorescence signals (GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/mCherry+). After chronic CS exposure, the mitochondrial complexes and function related genes were inhibited, while protein levels of complexes I and III slightly changed. Additionally, chronic CS exposure down-regulated most of the mitochondrial dynamic markers at gene expression level, included mitochondrial fusion/fission and mitochondrial translocate/transfer markers. For the markers related to mitophagy, Pink1 and Parkin, decreased gene and protein levels of Parkin, and decreased gene expression of Pink1, were identified in the CS exposure group. Hence, CS-induced mitophagy is mediated by Pink1-Parkin independent mechanism. Thus, we have shown that the chronic CS epxosure dysregulated mitochondrial complexes and dynamics and induced mitophagy, using the state-of-the art mitoQC reporter mouse model. Our results suggested that dysregulated mitochondrial function and dynamics are associated with CS-induced lung injury and phenotypic development of chronic lung diseases, such as COPD/ emphysema.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Essential role of MALAT1 in reducing traumatic brain injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35017438/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a highly evolutionary conserved long non-coding RNA, metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) was first demonstrated to be related to lung tumor metastasis by promoting angiogenesis. To investigate the role of MALAT1 in traumatic brain injury, we established mouse models of controlled cortical impact and cell models of oxygen-glucose deprivation to mimic traumatic brain injury in vitro and in vivo. The results revealed that MALAT1 silencing in vitro inhibited endothelial cell viability and tube formation but increased migration. In MALAT1-deficient mice, endothelial cell proliferation in the injured cortex, functional vessel density and cerebral blood flow were reduced. Bioinformatic analyses and RNA pull-down assays validated enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) as a downstream factor of MALAT1 in endothelial cells. Jagged-1, the Notch homolog 1 (NOTCH1) agonist, reversed the MALAT1 deficiency-mediated impairment of angiogenesis. Taken together, our results suggest that MALAT1 controls the key processes of angiogenesis following traumatic brain injury in an EZH2/NOTCH1-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many viral infections including influenza. Therefore, there is a need for therapeutic interventions that dampen and redirect inflammatory responses and, ideally, exert antiviral effects. Itaconate is an immunomodulatory metabolite which also reprograms cell metabolism and inflammatory responses when applied exogenously. We evaluated effects of endogenous itaconate and exogenous application of itaconate and its variants dimethyl- and 4-octyl-itaconate (DI, 4OI) on host responses to influenza A virus (IAV). Infection induced expression of ACOD1, the enzyme catalyzing itaconate synthesis, in monocytes and macrophages, which correlated with viral replication and was abrogated by DI and 4OI treatment. In IAV-infected mice, pulmonary inflammation and weight loss were greater in Acod1-/- than in wild-type mice, and DI treatment reduced pulmonary inflammation and mortality. The compounds reversed infection-triggered interferon responses and modulated inflammation in human cells supporting non-productive and productive infection, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in human lung tissue. All three itaconates reduced ROS levels and STAT1 phosphorylation, whereas AKT phosphorylation was reduced by 4OI and DI but increased by itaconate. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified monocytes as the main target of infection and the exclusive source of ACOD1 mRNA in peripheral blood. DI treatment silenced IFN-responses predominantly in monocytes, but also in lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Ectopic synthesis of itaconate in A549 cells, which do not physiologically express ACOD1, reduced infection-driven inflammation, and DI reduced IAV- and IFNγ-induced CXCL10 expression in murine macrophages independent of the presence of endogenous ACOD1. The compounds differed greatly in their effects on cellular gene homeostasis and released cytokines/chemokines, but all three markedly reduced release of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL2 (MCP-1). Viral replication did not increase under treatment despite the dramatically repressed IFN responses. In fact, 4OI strongly inhibited viral transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the compounds reduced viral titers (4OI&amp;gt;Ita&amp;gt;DI) in A549 cells whereas viral transcription was unaffected. Taken together, these results reveal itaconates as immunomodulatory and antiviral interventions for influenza virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macrophage interferon regulatory factor 4 deletion ameliorates aristolochic acid nephropathy via reduced migration and increased apoptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35025763/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristolochic acid (AA) is the causative nephrotoxic alkaloid in AA nephropathy, which results in a tubulointerstitial fibrosis. AA causes direct proximal tubule damage as well as an influx of macrophages, although the role of macrophages in pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that AA directly stimulates migration, inflammation, and ROS production in macrophages &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Cells lacking interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), a known regulator of macrophage migration and phenotype, had a reduced migratory response, though effects on ROS production and inflammation were preserved or increased relative to WT cells. Macrophage-specific IRF4-knockout mice were protected from both acute and chronic kidney effects of AA administration based on functional and histological analysis. Renal macrophages from kidneys of AA-treated macrophage-specific IRF4-knockout mice demonstrated increased apoptosis and ROS production compared with WT controls, indicating that AA directly polarizes macrophages to a promigratory and proinflammatory phenotype. However, knockout mice had reduced renal macrophage abundance following AA administration. While macrophages lacking IRF4 can adopt a proinflammatory phenotype upon AA exposure, their inability to migrate to the kidney and increased rates of apoptosis upon infiltration provide protection from AA &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. These results provide evidence of direct AA effects on macrophages in AA nephropathy and add to the growing body of evidence that supports a key role of IRF4 in modulating macrophage function in kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GRK2 promotes activation of lung fibroblast cells and contributes to pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis through increasing Smad3 expression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34852209/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive, and irreversible interstitial lung disease. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) plays a major role in lung fibroblast cell differentiation to myofibroblast cells and production of extracellular matrix, which are hallmarks of pulmonary fibrosis. G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) has been shown to play controversial roles in TGF-β1-induced signal transduction in different cell types; however, the role of GRK2 in TGF-β1-induced activation of lung fibroblast cells and development of pulmonary fibrosis has not been revealed. In this study, we found that GRK2 levels were increased in lungs and isolated fibroblast cells in a murine model of pulmonary fibrosis, as well as TGF-β1-treated lung fibroblasts. GRK2 levels were not changed in lungs in the injury phase of pulmonary fibrosis. Posttreatment with GRK2 inhibitor reduced extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation in lungs in bleomycin-challenged mice, suggesting that GRK2 activation contributes to the progressive phase of pulmonary fibrosis. Inhibition or downregulation of GRK2 attenuates fibronectin, collagen, and α-smooth muscle actin expression in TGF-β1-induced lung fibroblast cells or myofibroblast cells isolated from patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, we showed that GRK2 regulates Smad3 expression, indicating that inhibition of GRK2 attenuates ECM accumulation through downregulation of Smad3 expression. This study reveals that GRK2 is a therapeutic target in treating pulmonary fibrosis and inhibition of GRK2 dampens pulmonary fibrosis by suppression of Smad3 expression, eventually attenuating TGF-β1 signal pathway and ECM accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMPK/NFκB and NLRP3 interplay is a new therapeutic target in inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dapagliflozin mitigated lipopolysaccharide-mediated lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dapagliflozin anti-inflammatory effects were mediated through AMPK/NFĸB regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dapagliflozin inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is one the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. In this study, we examined for first time the role of dapagliflozin (DPGZ) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in rats and determined the underlying molecular mechanisms by evaluating the effects of DPGZ on adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK), nuclear transcription factor kappa B, nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor 3 inflammasome activation. Treatment of acute lung injured rats with either low dose (5 mg/kg) or high dose (10 mg/kg) DPGZ significantly decreased oxidative stress by decreasing malondialdehyde and nitric oxide tissue levels with a significant increase in spectrophotometric measurements of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and reduced glutathione levels. DPGZ treatment resulted in a significant anti-inflammatory effect as indicated by suppression in myeloperoxidase activity, MCP-1, IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α levels. DPGZ treatment also increased p-AMPK/t-AMPK with a significant reduction in NF-kB P65 binding activity and NFĸB p65 (pSer536) levels. These effects of DPGZ were accompanied by a significant reduction in NLRP3 levels and NLRP3 gene expression and a significant decrease in caspase-1 activity, which were also confirmed by histopathological examinations. We conclude that DPGZ antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity may occur through regulation of AMPK/NFĸB pathway and inhibition of NLRP3 activation. These results suggest that DPGZ represents a promising intervention for the treatment of ALI, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) has resulted in the global spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and an increase in complications including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Due to the lack of therapeutic options for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, recent attention has focused on differentiating hyper- and hypo-inflammatory phenotypes of ARDS to help define effective therapeutic strategies. Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has a role in neutrophil activation and has been identified within the pathogenesis and progression of this disease. The aim of this review is to highlight the role of IL-8 as a biomarker and prognostic factor in modulating the hyperinflammatory response in ARDS. The crucial role of IL-8 in lung inflammation and disease pathogenesis might suggest IL-8 as a possible new therapeutic target to efficiently modulate the hyperinflammatory response in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thrombospondin-1 Plays a Major Pathogenic Role in Experimental and Human Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35021035/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Extremely preterm infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung injury that lacks effective treatment. TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) is an antiangiogenic protein that activates TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-β1), a cytokine strongly linked to both experimental and human BPD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; 1) To examine effects of inhibiting TSP-1-mediated TGF-β1 activation (LSKL [leucine-serine-lysine-leucine]) in neonatal rats with bleomycin-induced lung injury; 2) to examine effects of a TSP-1 mimic (ABT-510) on lung morphology; and 3) to determine whether TSP-1 and related signaling peptides are increased in lungs of human preterm infants at risk for BPD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; From Postnatal Days 1 to 14, rat pups received daily intraperitoneal bleomycin (1 mg/kg) or vehicle and were treated with daily subcutaneous LSKL (20 mg/kg) or vehicle alone. Separate animals were treated with vehicle or ABT-510 (30 mg/kg/d). Paraffin-embedded lung tissues from 47 autopsies (controls; death &amp;lt;28 d, n = 30 and BPD at risk; death ⩾28 d, n = 17) performed on infants born &amp;lt;29 completed weeks&amp;rsquo; gestation were semiquantified for injury markers (collagen, macrophages, and 3-nitrotyrosine), TSP-1, and TGF-β1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/em&gt; Bleomycin or ABT-510 increased lung TGF-β1 activity and macrophage influx, caused pulmonary hypertension, and led to alveolar and microvascular hypoplasia. Treatment with LSKL partially prevented abnormal lung morphology secondary to bleomycin. Lungs from human infants at risk for BPD had increased contents of TSP-1 and TGF-β1 when compared with controls. TGF-β1 content correlated with markers of lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; TSP-1 inhibits alveologenesis in neonatal rats, in part via the upregulated activity of TGF-β1. Observations in human lungs suggest a similar pathogenic role for TSP-1 in infants at risk for BPD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomes derived from adipose-derived stem cells alleviate cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammation and injury by inhibiting alveolar macrophages pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35016678/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a frequently encountered disease condition in clinical practice mainly caused by cigarette smoke (CS). The aim of this study was to investigate the protective roles of human adipose-derived stem cells-derived exosomes (ADSCs-Exo) in CS-induced lung inflammation and injury and explore the underlying mechanism by discovering the effects of ADSCs-Exo on alveolar macrophages (AMs) pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; ADSCs were isolated from human adipose tissues harvested from three healthy donors, and then ADSCs-Exo were isolated. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, 24 age-matched male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to CS for 4 weeks, followed by intratracheal administration of ADSCs-Exo or phosphate buffered saline. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, MH-S cells, derived from mouse AMs, were stimulated by 2% CS extract (CSE) for 24 h, followed by the treatment of ADSCs-Exo or phosphate buffered saline. Pulmonary inflammation was analyzed by detecting pro-inflammatory cells and mediators in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Lung histology was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Mucus production was determined by Alcian blue-periodic acid-Schiff staining. The profile of AMs pyroptosis was evaluated by detecting the levels of pyroptosis-indicated proteins. The inflammatory response in AMs and the phagocytic activity of AMs were also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In mice exposed to CS, the levels of pro-inflammatory cells and mediators were significantly increased, mucus production was markedly increased and lung architecture was obviously disrupted. AMs pyroptosis was elevated and AMs phagocytosis was inhibited. However, the administration of ADSCs-Exo greatly reversed these alterations caused by CS exposure. Consistently, in MH-S cells with CSE-induced properties modelling those found in COPD, the cellular inflammatory response was elevated, the pyroptotic activity was upregulated while the phagocytosis was decreased. Nonetheless, these abnormalities were remarkably alleviated by the treatment of ADSCs-Exo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; ADSCs-Exo effectively attenuate CS-induced airway mucus overproduction, lung inflammation and injury by inhibiting AMs pyroptosis. Therefore, hADSCs-Exo may be a promising cell-free therapeutic candidate for CS-induced lung inflammation and injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrative omics analysis identifies biomarkers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35015148/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial lung disease characterized by chronic progressive pulmonary fibrosis and a poor prognosis. Genetic studies, including transcriptomic and proteomics, have provided new insight into revealing mechanisms of IPF. Herein we provided a novel strategy to identify biomarkers by integrative analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of IPF patients. We examined the landscape of IPF patients&amp;rsquo; gene expression in the transcription and translation phases and investigated the expression and functions of two new potential biomarkers. Differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs were mainly enriched in pathways associated with immune system activities and inflammatory responses, while DE proteins are related to extracellular matrix production and wound repair. The upregulated genes in both phases are associated with wound repair and cell differentiation, while the downregulated genes in both phases are associated with reduced immune activities and the damage of the alveolar tissues. On this basis, we identified thirteen potential marker genes. Among them, we validated the expression changes of butyrophilin-like 9 (BTNL9) and plasmolipin (PLLP) and investigated their functional pathways in the IPF mechanism. Both genes are downregulated in the tissues of IPF patients and Bleomycin-induced mice, and co-expression analysis indicates that they have a protective effect by inhibiting extracellular matrix production and promoting wound repair in alveolar epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MRSA-induced endothelial permeability and acute lung injury are attenuated by FTY720 S-phosphonate</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35015568/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disruption of the lung endothelial barrier is a hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which no effective pharmacologic treatments exist. Prior work has demonstrated that FTY720 S-phosphonate (Tys), an analog of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and FTY720, exhibits potent endothelial cell (EC) barrier protective properties. In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of Tys against methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA), a frequent bacterial cause of ARDS. Tys-protected human lung EC from barrier disruption induced by heat-killed MRSA (HK-MRSA) or staphylococcal α-toxin and attenuated MRSA-induced cytoskeletal changes associated with barrier disruption, including actin stress fiber formation and loss of peripheral VE-cadherin and cortactin. Tys-inhibited Rho and myosin light chain (MLC) activation after MRSA and blocked MRSA-induced NF-κB activation and release of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8. In vivo, intratracheal administration of live MRSA in mice caused significant vascular leakage and leukocyte infiltration into the alveolar space. Pre- or posttreatment with Tys attenuated MRSA-induced lung permeability and levels of alveolar neutrophils. Posttreatment with Tys significantly reduced levels of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) VCAM-1 and plasma IL-6 and KC induced by MRSA. Dynamic intravital imaging of mouse lungs demonstrated Tys attenuation of HK-MRSA-induced interstitial edema and neutrophil infiltration into lung tissue. Tys did not directly inhibit MRSA growth or viability in vitro. In conclusion, Tys inhibits lung EC barrier disruption and proinflammatory signaling induced by MRSA in vitro and attenuates acute lung injury induced by MRSA in vivo. These results support the potential utility of Tys as a novel ARDS therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PAR1, a therapeutic target for remote lung injury associated with hind limb ischemia/reperfusion: ERK5/KLF2-dependent lung capillary barrier preservation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35031271/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is expressed in pneumocytes and endothelial cells of the alveolar barrier. Its activation by thrombin disrupts the barrier integrity dynamics and induces lung injury in in vitro and in vivo paradigms. Nonetheless, the role of PAR1, as a therapeutic target, in hind limb ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-mediated remote lung injury has been unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the potential benefit of PAR1 blockade using the selective antagonist SCH79797 in distant lung dysfunction following hind limb I/R injury with special emphasis on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5)/Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) axis. Rats were subdivided into control, bilateral hind limb I/R, SCH79797, and SCH79797+BIX02189 (ERK5 inhibitor) groups. PAR1 blockade, ERK5-dependently, alleviated alveolar barrier disruption as evidenced by reductions in both pulmonary systemic leakage of surfactant protein-D and lung fluid accumulation with increase in pulmonary claudin 5, vascular endothelial cadherin, and connexin 37 levels. Such improvements are downstream targets of the ERK5/KLF2-mediated sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) upregulated expression and pS536-nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 inhibition. SCH79797 effectively impedes the evoked inflammatory response and oxidative burst by suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, lipid peroxidation, and neutrophil infiltration while boosting the glutathione antioxidant defense. Accordingly, PAR1 could be a therapeutic target, where its blockade mitigated pulmonary-endothelial barrier disruption via mutual S1PR1 enhancement and NF-κB p65 inhibition following ERK5/KLF2 activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The dynamic changes in autophagy activity and its role in lung injury after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35014165/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) can cause acute lung injury (ALI), and its pathogenesis mimics ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Autophagy is also involved in lung I/R injury. The present study aimed to elucidate whether DHCA induces natural autophagy activation and its role in DHCA-mediated lung injury. Here, rats were randomly assigned to the Sham or DHCA group. The sham group (n = 5) only received anaesthesia and air intubation. DHCA group rats underwent cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) followed by the DHCA procedure. The rats were then sacrificed at 3, 6 and 24 h after the DHCA procedure (n = 5) to measure lung injury and autophagy activity. Chloroquine (CQ) was delivered to evaluate autophagic flux. DHCA caused lung injury, which was prominent 3-6 h after DHCA, as confirmed by histological examination and inflammatory cytokine quantification. Lung injury subsided at 24 h. Autophagy was suppressed 3 h but was exaggerated at 6 h. At both time points, autophagic flux appeared uninterrupted. To further assess the role of autophagy in DHCA-mediated lung injury, the autophagy inducer rapamycin and its inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) were applied, and lung injury was reassessed. When rapamycin was administered at an early time point, lung injury worsened, whereas administration of 3-MA at a late time point ameliorated lung injury, indicating that autophagy contributed to lung injury after DHCA. Our study presents a time course of lung injury following DHCA. Autophagy showed adaptive yet protective suppression 3 h after DHCA, as induction of autophagy caused worsening of lung tissue. In contrast, autophagy was exaggerated 6 h after DHCA, and autophagy inhibition attenuated DHCA-mediated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is one of the most common complications in COVID-19. Elastase has been recognized as an important target to prevent ALI/ARDS in the patient of COVID-19. Cyclotheonellazole A (CTL-A) is a natural macrocyclic peptide reported to be a potent elastase inhibitor. Herein, we completed the first total synthesis of CTL-A in 24 linear steps. The key reactions include three-component MAC reactions and two late-stage oxidations. We also provided seven CTL-A analogues and elucidated preliminary structure-activity relationships. The in vivo ALI mouse model further suggested that CTL-A alleviated acute lung injury with reductions in lung edema and pathological deterioration, which is better than sivelestat, one approved elastase inhibitor. The activity of CTL-A against elastase, along with its cellular safety and well-established synthetic route, warrants further investigation of CTL-A as a candidate against COVID-19 pathogeneses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomes from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells alleviate sepsis-induced lung injury in mice by inhibiting the secretion of IL-27 in macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35013123/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) represents a frequent sepsis-induced inflammatory disorder. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) elicit anti-inflammatory effects in sepsis. This study investigated the mechanism of exosomes from adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) in sepsis-induced ALI. The IL-27r&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; (WSX-1 knockout) or wild-type mouse model of sepsis was established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The model mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages were treated with ADMSC-exosomes. The content of Dil-labeled exosomes in pulmonary macrophages, macrophages CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in whole lung tissues, and IL-27 content in macrophages were detected. The mRNA expression and protein level of IL27 subunits P28 and EBI3 in lung tissue and the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β were measured. The pulmonary edema, tissue injury, and pulmonary vascular leakage were measured. In vitro, macrophages internalized ADMSC-exosomes, and ADMSC-exosomes inhibited IL-27 secretion in LPS-induced macrophages. In vivo, IL-27 knockout attenuated CLP-induced ALI. ADMSC-exosomes suppressed macrophage aggregation in lung tissues and inhibited IL-27 secretion. ADMSC-exosomes decreased the contents of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, reduced pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular leakage, and improved the survival rate of mice. Injection of recombinant IL-27 reversed the protective effect of ADMSC-exosomes on sepsis mice. Collectively, ADMSC-exosomes inhibited IL-27 secretion in macrophages and alleviated sepsis-induced ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity is an epidemic worldwide and the obese people suffer from a range of respiratory complications including fibrotic changes in the lung. The influence of obesity on the lung is multi-factorial, which is related to both mechanical injury and various inflammatory mediators produced by excessive adipose tissues, and infiltrated immune cells. Adiposity causes increased production of inflammatory mediators, for example, cytokines, chemokines, and adipokines, both locally and in the systemic circulation, thereby rendering susceptibility to respiratory diseases, and altered responses. Lung fibrosis is closely related to chronic inflammation in the lung. Current data suggest a link between lung fibrosis and diet-induced obesity, although the mechanism remains incomplete understood. This review summarizes findings on the association of lung fibrosis with obesity, highlights the role of several critical inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF-α, TGF-β, and MCP-1) in obesity related lung fibrosis and the implication of obesity in the outcomes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PGC-1α inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome via preserving mitochondrial viability to protect kidney fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35013155/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by mitochondrial damage and contributes to kidney fibrosis. However, it is unknown whether PGC-1α, a key mitochondrial biogenesis regulator, modulates NLRP3 inflammasome in kidney injury. Primary renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) were isolated from C57BL/6 mice. The NLRP3 inflammasome, mitochondrial dynamics and morphology, oxidative stress, and cell injury markers were examined in RTECs treated by TGF-β1 with or without Ppargc1a plasmid, PGC-1α activator (metformin), and siPGC-1α. In vivo, adenine-fed and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice were treated with metformin. In vitro, TGF-β1 treatment to RTECs suppressed the expressions of PGC-1α and mitochondrial dynamic-related genes. The NLRP3 inflammasome was also activated and the expression of fibrotic and cell injury markers was increased. PGC-1α induction with the plasmid and metformin improved mitochondrial dynamics and morphology and attenuated the NLRP3 inflammasome and cell injury. The opposite changes were observed by siPGC-1α. The oxidative stress levels, which are inducers of the NLRP3 inflammasome, were increased and the expression of TNFAIP3, a negative regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome regulated by PGC-1α, was decreased by TGF-β1 and siPGC-1α. However, PGC-1α restoration reversed these alterations. In vivo, adenine-fed and UUO mice models showed suppression of PGC-1α and TNFAIP3 and dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics. Moreover, the activation of oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome, and kidney fibrosis were increased in these mice. However, these changes were significantly reversed by metformin. This study demonstrated that kidney injury was ameliorated by PGC-1α-induced inactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via modulation of mitochondrial viability and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salidroside prevents PM2.5-induced BEAS-2B cell apoptosis via SIRT1-dependent regulation of ROS and mitochondrial function</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35026589/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 induces BEAS-2B cell apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salidroside inhibits BEAS-2B cell apoptosis induced by PM2.5 through improving the production of ROS and the damage of mitochondrial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The activation of SIRT1 plays a key role in the protective effect of Sal on PM2.5 induced apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM2.5 is a harmful air pollutant currently threatening public health. It has been closely linked to increased morbidity of bronchial asthma and lung cancer worldwide. Salidroside (Sal), an active component extracted from Rhodiola rosea, has been reported to ameliorate the progression of asthma. However, there are few studies on the protective effect of salidroside on PM2.5-induced bronchial epithelial cell injury, and the related molecular mechanism is not clear. Here, we aimed to explore the protective effect and related mechanism of Sal on PM2.5 bronchial injury. We chose 50 μg/mL PM2.5 for 24 h as a PM2.5-induced cell damage model. After that BEAS-2B cells were pretreated with 40, 80, 160 µM Sal for 24 h and then exposed to 50 μg/mL PM2.5 for 24 h. We found that Sal pretreatment significantly inhibited the decrease of cell viability induced by PM2.5. Sal was effective in preventing PM2.5-induced apoptotic features, including Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload, the cleavages of caspase 3, and the increases in levels of caspase 9 and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), ultimately, Sal significantly inhibited PM2.5-induced apoptosis. Sal improved mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to cytoplasm. Sal alleviated ROS production, decreased the level of MDA, prevented the reduction of CAT, SOD and GSH-Px and increased the expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), HO-1 and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in cells exposed to PM2.5. Furthermore, Sal improved the decrease of SIRT1 and PGC-1 α expression levels caused by PM2.5. In addition, inhibition of SIRT1 by EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) reversed the protective effects of Sal, including the decrease of ROS level, the increase of membrane potential level and the decrease of apoptosis level. Thus, Sal may be regarded as a potential drug to prevent PM2.5-induced apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells and other diseases with similar pathological&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound 270, a self-developed NF-κB inhibitor, possess anti-inflammation activity in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NF-κB inhibitor 270 has protective effects against LPS-induced septic AKI and ALI in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NF-κB inhibitor 270 is a potential candidate medicine in the treatment of AKI and ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NF-κB inhibitor 270 could be used in inflammatory associated diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute lung injury (ALI) have high morbidity and mortality, with no effective clinically available drugs. Anti-inflammation is effective strategy in the therapy of AKI and ALI. NF-κB is a target for the development of anti‑inflammatory agents. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of 270, self-developed NF-κB inhibitor, in LPS-induced AKI and ALI. LPS-induced macrophages were used to examine the anti-inflammation activity of 270 in vitro. Sepsis-induced AKI and ALI mice models were established by intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10 mg/kg) for 24 h. Oral administration 270 for 14 days before LPS stimulation. Plasma, kidney and lung tissues were collected and used for histopathology, biochemical assay, ELISA, RT-PCR, and western blot analyses. In vitro, we showed that 270 suppressed the inflammation response in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages and bone marrow derived macrophages. In vivo, we found that 270 ameliorated LPS-induced AKI and ALI, as evidenced by improving various pathological changes, reducing the expression of pro-inflammation genes, blocking the activation of NF-κB and JNK pathways, attenuating the elevated myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, ameliorating the activated ER stress, reversing the inhibition effect on autophagy in kidney and lung tissues, and alleviating the enhanced plasma level of creatinine (Crea), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and pro-inflammation cytokines. Our investigations provides evidence that NF-κB inhibitor 270 is a potential drug that against LPS-induced AKI and ALI in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STAT6/VDR Axis Mitigates Lung Inflammatory Injury by Promoting Nrf2 Signaling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35047105/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung inflammatory injury is a global public health concern. It is characterized by infiltration of diverse inflammatory cells and thickening of pulmonary septum along with oxidative stress to airway epithelial cells. STAT6 is a nuclear transcription factor that plays a crucial role in orchestrating the immune response, but its function in tissue inflammatory injury has not been comprehensively studied. Here, we demonstrated that STAT6 activation can protect against particle-induced lung inflammatory injury by resisting oxidative stress. Specifically, genetic ablation of STAT6 was observed to worsen particle-induced lung injury mainly by disrupting the lungs&amp;rsquo; antioxidant capacity, as reflected by the downregulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, an increase in malondialdehyde levels, and a decrease in glutathione levels. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been previously proved to positively regulate Nrf2 signals. In this study, silencing VDR expression in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells consistently suppressed autophagy-mediated activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, thereby aggravating particle-induced cell damage. Mechanically, STAT6 activation promoted the nuclear translocation of VDR, which increased the transcription of autophagy-related genes and induced Nrf2 signals, and silencing VDR abolished these effects. Our research provides important insights into the role of STAT6 in oxidative damage and reveals its potential underlying mechanism. This information not only deepens the appreciation of STAT6 but also opens new avenues for the discovery of therapies for inflammatory respiratory system disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5 promotes pulmonary fibrosis by modulating β-catenin signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35013220/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal interstitial lung disease with limited therapeutic options. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5 (ACP5) performs a variety of functions. However, its role in IPF remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of ACP5 are increased in IPF patient samples and mice with bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In particular, higher levels of ACP5 are present in the sera of IPF patients with a diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbonmonoxide (DLCO) less than 40% of the predicted value. Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Acp5&lt;/em&gt; deficiency protects mice from BLM-induced lung injury and fibrosis coupled with a significant reduction of fibroblast differentiation and proliferation. Mechanistic studies reveal that Acp5 is upregulated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in a TGF-β receptor 1 (TGFβR1)/Smad family member 3 (Smad3)-dependent manner, after which Acp5 dephosphorylates p-β-catenin at serine 33 and threonine 41, inhibiting the degradation of β-catenin and subsequently enhancing β-catenin signaling in the nucleus, which promotes the differentiation, proliferation and migration of fibroblast. More importantly, the treatment of mice with &lt;em&gt;Acp5&lt;/em&gt; siRNA-loaded liposomes or Acp5 inhibitor reverses established lung fibrosis. In conclusions, Acp5 is involved in the initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis and strategies aimed at silencing or suppressing Acp5 could be considered as potential therapeutic approaches against pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Validation and utility of ARDS subphenotypes identified by machine-learning models using clinical data: an observational, multicohort, retrospective analysis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35026177/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Two acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) subphenotypes (hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory) with distinct clinical and biological features and differential treatment responses have been identified using latent class analysis (LCA) in seven individual cohorts. To facilitate bedside identification of subphenotypes, clinical classifier models using readily available clinical variables have been described in four randomised controlled trials. We aimed to assess the performance of these models in observational cohorts of ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this observational, multicohort, retrospective study, we validated two machine-learning clinical classifier models for assigning ARDS subphenotypes in two observational cohorts of patients with ARDS: Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury (EARLI; n=335) and Validating Acute Lung Injury Markers for Diagnosis (VALID; n=452), with LCA-derived subphenotypes as the gold standard. The primary model comprised only vital signs and laboratory variables, and the secondary model comprised all predictors in the primary model, with the addition of ventilatory variables and demographics. Model performance was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration plots, and assigning subphenotypes using a probability cutoff value of 0·5 to determine sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the assignments. We also assessed the performance of the primary model in EARLI using data automatically extracted from an electronic health record (EHR; EHR-derived EARLI cohort). In Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG SAFE; n=2813), a multinational, observational ARDS cohort, we applied a custom classifier model (with fewer variables than the primary model) to determine the prognostic value of the subphenotypes and tested their interaction with the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy, with 90-day mortality as the dependent variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Findings:&lt;/em&gt; The primary clinical classifier model had an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0·92 (95% CI 0·90-0·95) in EARLI and 0·88 (0·84-0·91) in VALID. Performance of the primary model was similar when using exclusively EHR-derived predictors compared with manually curated predictors (AUC=0·88 [95% CI 0·81-0·94] vs 0·92 [0·88-0·97]). In LUNG SAFE, 90-day mortality was higher in patients assigned the hyperinflammatory subphenotype than in those with the hypoinflammatory phenotype (414 [57%] of 725 vs 694 [33%] of 2088; p&amp;lt;0·0001). There was a significant treatment interaction with PEEP strategy and ARDS subphenotype (p=0·041), with lower 90-day mortality in the high PEEP group of patients with the hyperinflammatory subphenotype (hyperinflammatory subphenotype: 169 [54%] of 313 patients in the high PEEP group vs 127 [62%] of 205 patients in the low PEEP group; hypoinflammatory subphenotype: 231 [34%] of 675 patients in the high PEEP group vs 233 [32%] of 734 patients in the low PEEP group).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/em&gt; Classifier models using clinical variables alone can accurately assign ARDS subphenotypes in observational cohorts. Application of these models can provide valuable prognostic information and could inform management strategies for personalised treatment, including application of PEEP, once prospectively validated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CRISPRi links COVID-19 GWAS loci to LZTFL1 and RAVER1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34998241/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34998241/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; To identify host genetic variants (SNPs) associated with COVID-19 disease severity, a number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted. Since most of the identified variants are located at non-coding regions, such variants are presumed to affect the expression of neighbouring genes, thereby influencing COVID-19 disease severity. However, it remains largely unknown which genes are influenced by such COVID-19 GWAS loci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; CRISPRi (interference)-mediated gene expression analysis was performed to identify genes functionally regulated by COVID-19 GWAS loci by targeting regions near the loci (SNPs) in lung epithelial cell lines. The expression of CRISPRi-identified genes was investigated using COVID-19-contracted human and monkey lung single-nucleus/cell (sn/sc) RNA-seq datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Findings:&lt;/em&gt; CRISPRi analysis indicated that a region near rs11385942 at chromosome 3p21.31 (locus of highest significance with COVID-19 disease severity at intron 5 of LZTFL1) significantly affected the expression of LZTFL1 (P&amp;lt;0.05), an airway cilia regulator. A region near rs74956615 at chromosome 19p13.2 (locus located at the 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated exonic region of RAVER1), which is associated with critical illness in COVID-19, affected the expression of RAVER1 (P&amp;lt;0.05), a coactivator of MDA5 (IFIH1), which induces antiviral response genes, including ICAM1. The sn/scRNA-seq datasets indicated that the MDA5/RAVER1-ICAM1 pathway was activated in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19-resistant monkeys but not those of COVID-19-succumbed humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/em&gt; Patients with risk alleles of rs11385942 and rs74956615 may be susceptible to critical illness in COVID-19 in part through weakened airway viral clearance via LZTFL1-mediated ciliogenesis and diminished antiviral immune response via the MDA5/RAVER1 pathway, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibrotic lung disease inhibits immune responses to staphylococcal pneumonia via impaired neutrophil and macrophage function</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease characterized by collagen deposition within the lung interstitium. Bacterial infection is associated with increased morbidity and more rapid mortality in IPF patient populations, and pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are commonly isolated from the lungs of hospitalized patients with IPF. Despite this, the effects of fibrotic lung injury on critical immune responses to infection remain unknown. In the present study, we show that, like humans with IPF, fibrotic mice infected with MRSA exhibit increased morbidity and mortality compared with uninfected fibrotic mice. We determine that fibrosis conferred a defect in MRSA clearance compared with nonfibrotic mice, resulting from blunted innate immune responses. We show that fibrosis inhibited neutrophil intracellular killing of MRSA through impaired neutrophil elastase release and oxidative radical production. Additionally, we demonstrate that lung macrophages from fibrotic mice have impaired phagocytosis of MRSA. Our study describes potentially novel impairments of antimicrobial responses upon pulmonary fibrosis development, and our findings suggest a possible mechanism for why patients with IPF are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality related to infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) and Covid-19: A new frontiers for therapeutic modality</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35032828/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are solid inflammatory reactions due to neutrophil recruitments and formation of NETs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustained formations of NETs during respiratory viral infections are associated with collateral tissue injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anti-NETs of natural or synthetic sources may mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced complications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NETs can inactivate a wide range of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NETs can trigger innate immunity through activation release of interferon from dendritic cells and adaptive immunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a worldwide infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is severe inflammatory reactions due to neutrophil recruitments and infiltration in the different organs with the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which involved various complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the objective of the present review was to explore the potential role of NETs in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify the targeting drugs against NETs in Covid-19 patients. Different enzyme types are involved in the formation of NETs, such as neutrophil elastase (NE), which degrades nuclear protein and release histones, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (PADA4), which releases chromosomal DNA and gasdermin D, which creates pores in the NTs cell membrane that facilitating expulsion of NT contents. Despite of the beneficial effects of NETs in controlling of invading pathogens, sustained formations of NETs during respiratory viral infections are associated with collateral tissue injury. Excessive development of NETs in SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked with the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to creation of the NETs-IL-1β loop. Also, aberrant NTs activation alone or through NETs formation may augment SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm (CS) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) in patients with severe Covid-19. Furthermore, NETs formation in SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with immuno-thrombosis and the development of ALI/ARDS. Therefore, anti-NETs therapy of natural or synthetic sources may mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced exaggerated immune response, hyperinflammation, immuno-thrombosis, and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>METTL3-mediated m6A modification of TIMP2 mRNA promotes podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34995800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic changes are present in many physiological and pathological processes. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is the most common modification in eukaryotic mRNA. However, the role of m6A modification in diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains elusive. Here, we found that m6A modification was significantly upregulated in the kidney of type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice, which was caused by elevated levels of METTL3. Moreover, METTL3 is increased in podocyte of renal biopsy from patients with DN, which is related to renal damage. METTL3 knockout significantly reduced the inflammation and apoptosis in high glucose (HG)-stimulated podocytes, while its overexpression significantly aggravated these responses in vitro. Podocyte-conditional knockout METTL3 significantly alleviated podocyte injury and albuminuria in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Therapeutically, silencing METTL3 with adeno-associated virus serotype-9 (AAV9)-shMETTL3 in vivo mitigated albuminuria and histopathological injury in STZ-induced diabetic mice and db/db mice. Mechanistically, METTL3 modulated Notch signaling via the m6A modification of TIMP2 in an insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2)-dependent manner and exerted pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects. In summary, this study suggested that METTL3-mediated m6A modification is an important mechanism of podocyte injury in DN. Targeting m6A through the writer enzyme METTL3 is a potential approach for the treatment of DN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-Covid pulmonary fibrosis is evident following severe COVID-19. There is an urgent need to identify the cellular and pathophysiological characteristics of chronic lung squeals of Covid-19 for the development of future preventive and/or therapeutic interventions. Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells can mediate local immune protection against infections and cancer. Less beneficially, lung TRM cells cause chronic airway inflammation and fibrosis by stimulating pathologic inflammation. The effects of Janus kinase (JAK), an inducer pathway of cytokine storm, inhibition on acute Covid-19 cases have been previously evaluated. Here, we propose that Tofacitinib by targeting the CD8+ TRM cells could be a potential candidate for the treatment of chronic lung diseases induced by acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pandemic Influenza Infection Promotes Streptococcus pneumoniae Infiltration, Necrotic Damage, and Proteomic Remodeling in the Heart</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35089061/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over a century, it has been reported that primary influenza infection promotes the development of a lethal form of bacterial pulmonary disease. More recently, pneumonia events caused by both viruses and bacteria have been directly associated with cardiac damage. Importantly, it is not known whether viral-bacterial synergy extends to extrapulmonary organs such as the heart. Using label-free quantitative proteomics and molecular approaches, we report that primary infection with pandemic influenza A virus leads to increased Streptococcus pneumoniae translocation to the myocardium, leading to general biological alterations. We also observed that each infection alone led to proteomic changes in the heart, and these were exacerbated in the secondary bacterial infection (SBI) model. Gene ontology analysis of significantly upregulated proteins showed increased innate immune activity, oxidative processes, and changes to ion homeostasis during SBI. Immunoblots confirmed increased complement and antioxidant activity in addition to increased expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Using an &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; model of sequential infection in human cardiomyocytes, we observed that influenza enhances S. pneumoniae cytotoxicity by promoting oxidative stress enhancing bacterial toxin-induced necrotic cell death. Influenza infection was found to increase receptors that promote bacterial adhesion, such as polymeric immunoglobulin receptor and fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 1 in cardiomyocytes. Finally, mice deficient in programmed necrosis (i.e., necroptosis) showed enhanced innate immune responses, decreased virus-associated pathways, and promotion of mitochondrial function upon SBI. The presented results provide the first &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; evidence that influenza infection promotes S. pneumoniae infiltration, necrotic damage, and proteomic remodeling of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adverse cardiac events are a common complication of viral and bacterial pneumonia. For over a century, it has been recognized that influenza infection promotes severe forms of pulmonary disease mainly caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. The extrapulmonary effects of secondary bacterial infections to influenza virus are not known. In the present study, we used a combination of quantitative proteomics and molecular approaches to assess the underlying mechanisms of how influenza infection promotes bacteria-driven cardiac damage and proteome remodeling. We further observed that programmed necrosis (i.e., necroptosis) inhibition leads to reduced damage and proteome changes associated with health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PTX3 alleviates hard metal-induced acute lung injury through potentiating efferocytosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34995911/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WC-Co exposure induces inflammatory response and apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WC-Co stimulation increases PTX3 expression in vivo and the trend is paralleled with the lung inflammation severity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apoptotic cells exhibited higher levels of PTX3 on the surface of the membrane after WC-Co treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PTX3 on the surface of apoptotic cells membrane efficiently facilitates efferocytosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged exposure to hard metal dust results in hard metal lung disease (HMLD) characterized by respiratory symptoms. Understanding the pathogenesis and pathological process of HMLD would be helpful for its early diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we established a mouse model of hard metal-induced acute lung injury through one-time intratracheal instillation of WC-Co dust suspension. We found that WC-Co treatment damaged the lungs of mice, leading to increased production of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-18, inflammatory cells infiltration and apoptosis. In vitro, WC-Co induced cytotoxicity, inflammatory response and apoptosis in macrophages (PMA-treated THP-1) and epithelial cells (A549) in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, RNA-sequence and validation experiments verified that Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), an important mediator in the regulation of inflammation, was elevated both in vivo and in vitro induced by WC-Co. Functional experiments confirmed the PTX3, which was located on the membrane of apoptotic cells, promoted macrophage efferocytosis efficiently. This progress could help block the lung inflammation and contribute to the rapid recovery of WC-Co-induced acute lung injury. These observations provide a further understanding of the molecular mechanism of WC-Co-induced pulmonary injury and disclose PTX3 as a new potential therapeutic approach to relieve WC-Co-induced acute lung injury via efferocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vitamin C Deficiency Causes Cell Type-Specific Epigenetic Reprogramming and Acute Tubular Necrosis in a Mouse Model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34983833/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Vitamin C deficiency is found in patients with variable kidney diseases. However, the role of vitamin C as an epigenetic regulator in renal homeostasis and pathogenesis remains largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We showed that vitamin C deficiency leads to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) using a vitamin C-deficient mouse model (Gulo knock-out). DNA/RNA epigenetic modifications and injured S3 proximal tubule cells were identified in the vitamin C-deficient kidneys using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, and single-cell RNA sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Integrated evidence suggested that epigenetic modifications affected the proximal tubule cells and fenestrated endothelial cells, leading to tubule injury and hypoxia through transcriptional regulation. Strikingly, loss of DNA hydroxymethylation and DNA hypermethylation in vitamin C-deficient kidneys preceded the histologic sign of tubule necrosis, indicating the causality of vitamin C-induced epigenetic modification in ATN. Consistently, prophylactic supplementation of an oxidation-resistant vitamin C derivative, ascorbyl phosphate magnesium, promoted DNA demethylation and prevented the progression of cisplatin-induced ATN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Vitamin C played a critical role in renal homeostasis and pathogenesis in a mouse model, suggesting vitamin supplementation may be an approach to lower the risk of kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fatal COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Is Associated with Incomplete Alveolar Type 1 Epithelial Cell Differentiation from the Transitional State without Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34973949/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 and other etiologies results from injury to the alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) barrier resulting in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, which causes acute respiratory failure; recovery requires epithelial regeneration. During physiological regeneration in mice, type 2 AECs (AEC2s) proliferate, exit the cell cycle, transiently assume a transitional state, then differentiate into type 1 AECs (AEC1s); in humans, persistence of the transitional state is associated with pulmonary fibrosis. It is unknown whether transitional cells emerge and differentiate into AEC1s without fibrosis in human ARDS and why transitional cells differentiate into AEC1s during physiological regeneration but persist in fibrosis. We hypothesized that incomplete but ongoing AEC1 differentiation from transitional cells without fibrosis may underlie persistent barrier permeability and acute respiratory failure in ARDS. Immunostaining of postmortem ARDS lungs revealed abundant transitional cells without fibrosis. They were typically cuboidal or partially spread, sometimes flat, and occasionally expressed AEC1 markers. Immunostaining and/or single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that transitional cells in mouse models of physiological regeneration, ARDS, and fibrosis express markers of cell cycle exit but only in fibrosis express a specific senescence marker. Thus, in severe, fatal early ARDS, AEC1 differentiation from transitional cells is incomplete, underlying persistent barrier permeability and respiratory failure but ongoing without fibrosis; senescence of transitional cells may be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of key immune genes for sepsis-induced ARDS based on bioinformatics analysis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34898369/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the extremely high mortality caused by sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it is urgent to develop new biomarkers of sepsis-induced ARDS for treatment. Here, 532 differential expression genes (DEGs) related to sepsis and 433 DEGs related to sepsis-induced ARDS were screened in the GSE32707 dataset. Compared with sepsis samples, sepsis ARDS samples showed a higher infiltration of activated memory CD4 T cells and naive B cells, but a relatively lower infiltration of CD8 T cells. The pink and green modules which are significantly associated with sepsis-induced ARDS were then screened through co-expression network analysis. Differentially up-regulated GYPE and aberrantly down-regulated HSPB1, were subsequently found in the pink module of ARDS. CD81 and RPL22, two differentially low-expressed genes peculiar to ARDS, were identified in the green module. The function of CD81 was verified at the cellular level, and it was found that the up-regulation of CD81 in A549 could alleviate the LPS-induced injury of A549 cells. More importantly, the overexpressed CD81 can also increase the content of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD25&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Foxp3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Treg in Jurkat cells, and after the co-culture of overexpressed CD81 Jurkat cells with LPS treatment A549 cells, the LPS-induced lung epithelial cell damage can be improved. Overall, four new plasma biomarker candidates were found in sepsis-induced ARDS, and we verified that CD81 may play critical roles in the biological and immunological processes of sepsis-induced ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating extracellular vesicles activate the pyroptosis pathway in the brain following ventilation-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34965880/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Mechanical ventilation of preterm newborns causes lung injury and is associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, the mechanistic links between ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) and brain injury is not well defined. Since circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) are known to link distant organs by transferring their cargos, we hypothesized that EVs mediate inflammatory brain injury associated with VILI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Neonatal rats were mechanically ventilated with low (10 mL/kg) or high (25 mL/kg) tidal volume for 1 h on post-natal day 7 followed by recovery for 2 weeks. Exosomes were isolated from the plasma of these rats and adoptively transferred into normal newborn rats. We assessed the effect of mechanical ventilation or exosome transfer on brain inflammation and activation of the pyroptosis pathway by western blot and histology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Injurious mechanical ventilation induced similar markers of inflammation and pyroptosis, such as increased IL-1β and activated caspase-1/gasdermin D (GSDMD) in both lung and brain, in addition to inducing microglial activation and cell death in the brain. Isolated EVs were enriched for the exosomal markers CD9 and CD81, suggesting enrichment for exosomes. EVs isolated from neonatal rats with VILI had increased caspase-1 but not GSDMD. Adoptive transfer of these EVs led to neuroinflammation with microglial activation and activation of caspase-1 and GSDMD in the brain similar to that observed in neonatal rats that were mechanically ventilated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings suggest that circulating EVs can contribute to the brain injury and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants with VILI through activation of GSDMD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Renal and Cerebral Hypoxia and Inflammation During Cardiopulmonary Bypass</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34964119/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury and brain injury remain common despite ongoing efforts to improve both the equipment and procedures deployed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The pathophysiology of injury of the kidney and brain during CPB is not completely understood. Nevertheless, renal (particularly in the medulla) and cerebral hypoxia and inflammation likely play critical roles. Multiple practical factors, including depth and mode of anesthesia, hemodilution, pump flow, and arterial pressure can influence oxygenation of the brain and kidney during CPB. Critically, these factors may have differential effects on these two vital organs. Systemic inflammatory pathways are activated during CPB through activation of the complement system, coagulation pathways, leukocytes, and the release of inflammatory cytokines. Local inflammation in the brain and kidney may be aggravated by ischemia (and thus hypoxia) and reperfusion (and thus oxidative stress) and activation of resident and infiltrating inflammatory cells. Various strategies, including manipulating perfusion conditions and administration of pharmacotherapies, could potentially be deployed to avoid or attenuate hypoxia and inflammation during CPB. Regarding manipulating perfusion conditions, based on experimental and clinical data, increasing standard pump flow and arterial pressure during CPB appears to offer the best hope to avoid hypoxia and injury, at least in the kidney. Pharmacological approaches, including use of anti-inflammatory agents such as dexmedetomidine and erythropoietin, have shown promise in preclinical models but have not been adequately tested in human trials. However, evidence for beneficial effects of corticosteroids on renal and neurological outcomes is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TNF-α Induces Neutrophil Apoptosis Delay and Promotes Intestinal Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Lung Injury through Activating JNK/FoxO3a Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35003520/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Intestinal ischemia is a common clinical critical illness. Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IIR) leads to acute lung injury (ALI), but the causative factors of ALI are unknown. The aim of this study was to reveal the causative factors and mechanisms of IIR-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A mouse model of IIR was developed using C57BL/6 mice, followed by detection of lung injury status and plasma levels of inflammatory factors in sham-operated mice and model mice. Some model mice were treated with a tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor lenalidomide (10 mg/kg), followed by observation of lung injury status through hematoxylin and eosin staining and detection of neutrophil infiltration levels through naphthol esterase and Ly6G immunohistochemical staining. Additionally, peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were cultured &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and then stimulated by TNF-α to mimic &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; inflammatory stimuli; this TNF-α stimulation was also performed on PMNs after knockdown of FoxO3a or treatment with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. PMN apoptosis after stimulation was detected using flow cytometry. Finally, the role of PMN apoptosis in IIR-induced lung injury was evaluated in vivo by detecting the ALI status in the model mice administered with ABT-199, a Bcl-2 inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; IIR led to pulmonary histopathological injury and increased lung water content, which were accompanied by increased plasma levels of inflammatory factors, with the TNF-α plasma level showing the most pronounced increase. Inhibition of TNF-α led to effective reduction of lung tissue injury, especially that of the damaging infiltration of PMNs in the lung. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; knockdown of FoxO3a or inhibition of JNK activity could inhibit TNF-α-induced PMN apoptosis. Further &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments revealed that ABT-199 effectively alleviated lung injury and decreased inflammation levels by promoting PMN apoptosis during IIR-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; TNF-α activates the JNK/FoxO3a pathway to induce a delay in PMN apoptosis, which promotes IIR-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HuR drives lung fibroblast differentiation but not metabolic reprogramming in response to TGF-β and hypoxia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34963461/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pulmonary fibrosis is thought to be driven by recurrent alveolar epithelial injury which leads to the differentiation of fibroblasts into α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-expressing myofibroblasts and subsequent deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) plays a key role in fibroblast differentiation, which we have recently shown involves human antigen R (HuR). HuR is an RNA binding protein that also increases the translation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α) mRNA, a transcription factor critical for inducing a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis. This metabolic shift may cause fibroblast differentiation. We hypothesized that under hypoxic conditions, HuR controls myofibroblast differentiation and glycolytic reprogramming in human lung fibroblasts (HLFs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Primary HLFs were cultured in the presence (or absence) of TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) under hypoxic (1% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or normoxic (21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) conditions. Evaluation included mRNA and protein expression of glycolytic and myofibroblast/ECM markers by qRT-PCR and western blot. Metabolic profiling was done by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H- NMR). Separate experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of HuR on metabolic reprogramming using siRNA-mediated knock-down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Hypoxia alone had no significant effect on fibroblast differentiation or metabolic reprogramming. While hypoxia- together with TGFβ1- increased mRNA levels of differentiation and glycolysis genes, such as ACTA2, LDHA, and HK2, protein levels of α-SMA and collagen 1 were significantly reduced. Hypoxia induced cytoplasmic translocation of HuR. Knockdown of HuR reduced features of fibroblast differentiation in response to TGF-β1 with and without hypoxia, including α-SMA and the ECM marker collagen I, but had no effect on lactate secretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Hypoxia reduced myofibroblasts differentiation and lactate secretion in conjunction with TGF-β. HuR is an important protein in the regulation of myofibroblast differentiation but does not control glycolysis in HLFs in response to hypoxia. More research is needed to understand the functional implications of HuR in IPF pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular insights into the early stage of glomerular injury in IgA nephropathy using single-cell RNA sequencing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34968552/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and defined by the presence of IgA-containing immune complexes in the mesangium that induce an inflammation leading to glomerulonephritis. Since we poorly understand early mechanisms of glomerular injury in IgAN we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of glomerulus-associated cells using SMARTseq2-technology at the early stage of IgAN in grouped ddY-mice. Cell-specific molecular signatures unraveled a key role of endothelial cells in the early pathogenesis of IgAN, especially in the recruitment and infiltration of immune cells. Mesangial and podocyte cells demonstrated less molecular changes. Several intra-glomerular paracrine pathways were detected, such as mesangial cell-derived Slit3 potentially activating Robo-receptors in podocyte/endothelial cells. Surprisingly, proximal tubular cells were strongly affected at the early stage and potential glomerulo-tubular cell-cell crosstalk pathways were identified. Importantly, many of the cellular transcriptomic signatures identified in this well-established mouse model were also detected in published bulk transcriptomic data in human IgAN. Moreover, we validated the functionality of key cell-cell crosstalk pathways using cell culture models, such as the effect of the Slit-Robo signalling axis. Thus, our study provides important novel molecular insights into the pathogenesis of early IgAN-associated glomerulopathy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PIWI-interacting RNA-23210 protects against acetaminophen-induced liver injury by targeting HNF1A and HNF4A</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34968487/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is one of the leading causes of acute liver failure in the US and other developed countries, the molecular mechanisms of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity remain speculative. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a novel class of small non-coding RNAs, have been identified as epigenetic regulators of transposon silencing, mRNA deadenylation, and elimination. However, the functional role of piRNAs in APAP-induced liver injury remains unclear. In the current study, the piRNA profiles were constructed in HepaRG cells after APAP exposure, and the roles of piR-23210 in regulating nuclear receptors (NRs) expression, metabolizing enzymes expression, and consequently APAP-induced liver injury were systematically investigated. As a result, 57 upregulated piRNAs were identified after APAP exposure, indicating the stress-response characteristic of piRNA molecules. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments proved that piR-23210 is a novel self-protective molecule that targets HNF1A and HNF4A transcripts by interacting with RNA binding protein Nucleolin (NCL), suppresses downstream CYPs (CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2) expression, and protects against APAP-induced liver injury. In conclusion, our findings provided new mechanistic clues revealing potential protective role of a piRNA against the hepatoxicity of APAP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory infected by COVID-19 represents a major global health problem at moment even after recovery from virus corona. Since, the lung lesions for infected patients are still sufferings from acute respiratory distress syndrome including alveolar septal edema, pneumonia, hyperplasia, and hyaline membranes Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify additional candidates having ability to overcome inflammatory process and can enhance efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. The polypenolic extracts were integrated into moeties of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then were coated by chitosan as a mucoadhesion polymer. The results of interleukin-6, and c-reactive protein showed significant reduction in group treated by Encap. SIL + CUR (64 ± 0.8 Pg/μL &amp;amp; 6 ± 0.5 μg/μL) compared to group treated by Cham. + CUR (102 ± 0.8 Pg/μL &amp;amp; 7 ± 0.5 μg/μL) respectively and free capsules (with no any drug inside) (148 ± 0.6 Pg/μL &amp;amp; 10 ± 0.6 μg/μL) respectively. Histopathology profile was improved completely. Additionally, encapsulating silymarin showed anti-viral activity in vitro COVID-19 experiment. It can be summarized that muco-inhalable delivery system (MIDS) loaded by silymarin can be used to overcome inflammation induced by oleic acid and to overcome COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astragaloside IV pre-treatment attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats: Impact on autophagy, apoptosis and inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35026504/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autophagy flux inhibition is a critical mechanism of PM2.5-induced lung toxicity in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 triggered pulmonary inflammation by tipping the balance between autophagy and apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV increased autophagic flux and inhibited apoptosis and inflammation by activation of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in a PM2.5-induced rat lung toxicity model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm, exerts serious lung toxicity. At present, effective prevention measures and treatment modalities for pulmonary toxicity caused by PM2.5 are lacking. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is a natural product that has received increasing attention from researchers for its unique biological functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate the protective effects of AS-IV on PM2.5-induced pulmonary toxicity and identify its potential mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The rat model of PM2.5-induced lung toxicity was created by intratracheal instillation of PM2.5 dust suspension. The investigation was performed with AS-IV or in combination with autophagic flux inhibitor (Chloroquine) or AMP-sensitive protein kinase (AMPK)-specific inhibitor (Compound C). Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxy-nucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and western blotting. Autophagy was detected by immunofluorescence staining, autophagic flux measurement, western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy. The AMPK/mTOR pathway was analyzed by western blotting. Inflammation was analyzed by western blotting and suspension array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; AS-IV prevented histopathological injury, inflammation, autophagy dysfunction, apoptosis, and changes in AMPK levels induced by PM2.5. AS-IV increased autophagic flux and inhibited apoptosis and inflammation by activating the AMPK/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. However, AS-IV had no protective effect on PM2.5-induced lung injury following treatment with Compound C or Chloroquine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; AS-IV prevented PM2.5-induced lung toxicity by restoring the balance among autophagy, apoptosis, and inflammation in rats by activating the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free fatty acids-induced neutrophil extracellular traps lead to dendritic cells activation and T cell differentiation in acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34959222/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate whether free fatty acids (FFAs) could induce the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), as well as the mechanism of FFAs-induced NETs in acute lung injury (ALI). FFAs were used to induce NETs production. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was detected after FFA and NADPH oxidase inhibitor treatments. The association between FFAs-induced NETs and the activation of p38, ERK, and JNK pathways was investigated. The effect of FFAs-induced NETs on the dendritic cells (DCs) activation and T cell differentiation was investigated. FFAs could induce neutrophils to produce NETs. FFAs significantly promoted ROS production and increased the expression of ERK, p38 and JNK, and treatment of the inhibitors of NAPDH oxidase (DPI), p38 (SB202190), ERK1/2 (U0126) and JNK (SP600125) inhibited FAAs-induced NETs production. FFAs induced NETs could promote DCs activation and consequently led to the differentiation of primary CD4+ T cells into Th1 and Th17 cells and the release of IL-1β, IL-12 and TNF-α. FFAs are capable of inducing NETs via NOX, ERK, p38 and JNK pathways. FFA-induced NETs further lead to DCs activation and T cell differentiation, which can well explain the mechanism of ALI caused by FFAs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of Bruton&#39;s Tyrosine Kinase Activity Attenuates Hemorrhagic Shock-Induced Multiple Organ Dysfunction in Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35129479/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; The aim of this study was to investigate (a) the potential of the Bruton&amp;rsquo;s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors (BTKi) acalabrutinib and fenebrutinib to reduce multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in acute (short-term and long-term follow-up) hemorrhagic shock (HS) rat models and (b) whether treatment with either acalabrutinib or fenebrutinib attenuates BTK, NF-κB and NLRP3 activation in HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The MODS caused by an excessive systemic inflammatory response following trauma is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. The protein BTK is known to play a role in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is a key component of the innate inflammatory response. However, its role in trauma-hemorrhage is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Acute HS rat models were performed to determine the influence of acalabrutinib or fenebrutinib on MODS. The activation of BTK, NF-κB and NLRP3 pathways were analyzed by western blot in the kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrated that (a) HS caused organ injury and/or dysfunction and hypotension (post resuscitation) in rats, while (b) treatment of HS-rats with either acalabrutinib or fenebrutinib attenuated the organ injury and dysfunction in acute HS models and (c) reduced the activation of BTK, NF-κB and NLRP3 pathways in the kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results point to a role of BTK in the pathophysiology of organ injury and dysfunction caused by trauma/hemorrhage and indicate that BTK inhibitors may be repurposed as a potential therapeutic approach for MODS after trauma and/or hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long non-coding RNA MALAT1 modulates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway by sponging miRNA-133a-3p to target IGF1R expression</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) is a complex pathophysiological process that can lead to poor patient outcomes. Although LncRNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is reported to be highly expressed in myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury, the specific mechanism remains largely unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the roles and possible mechanism of MALAT1 in myocardial IR injury. IR model was established in rats by ligation of the anterior descending artery in vivo, and H9c2 and HL-1 cells were treated by hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR) to construct the model in vitro. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) for MALAT1 and miR-133a-3p mimics, inhibitor was used to transfect the cells. The expression of MALAT1, miR-133a-3p in MIRI were evaluated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)，immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot (WB). Relationships between MALAT1, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) with miR-133a-3p were confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Annexin V-FITC/PI double-labeled flow cytometry, terminal dexynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), serum creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were evaluated to examine the impact of MALAT1 on MIRI. Our results revealed that MALAT1 was highly expressed, while miR-133a-3p and IGF1R were repressed in IR and HR groups. Knockdown of MALAT1 alleviate the pro-apoptotic effect and myocardial injury in vitro and in vivo. Systematically, MALAT1 may serve as a sponge for miR-133a-3p to suppress IGF1R, which a direct target of miR-133a-3p, then inhibit the PI3K/Akt/eNOS survival pathway. Mechanistically, our study demonstrated that MALAT1 regulates PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling via miR-133a-3p. In summary, these results suggest that MALAT1 and miR-133a-3p play important roles in MIRI. MALAT1 regulates miR-133a-3p /IGF1R axis. These results show light on the underlying mechanisms of MIRI and provide potential therapeutic targets for MIRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Octreotide activates autophagy to alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced human pulmonary epithelial cell injury by inhibiting the protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34898367/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octreotide is a synthetic octapeptide of natural somatostatin. We aimed to investigate the influence of Octreotide on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human pulmonary epithelial cell damage. After stimulated by LPS, BEAS-2B cells were treated with various concentrations of Octreotide. CCK-8 assay and LDH kits were to evaluate cell cytotoxicity. ELISA kits were to analyze the levels of inflammatory factors. TUNEL staining was to measure cell apoptosis. Western blot assay was used to assess the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, autophagy-related proteins and AKT/mTOR signaling-related proteins. Then, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) was adopted for treating BEAS-2B cells to determine its effects on inflammation and apoptosis. Afterward, adding AKT agonist (SC79) or mTOR antagonist (rapamycin) to explore the impact of Octreotide on autophagy. Results revealed that Octreotide notably enhanced cell viability and reduced LDH activity. The levels of inflammatory factors were significantly decreased following Octreotide treatment. Additionally, Octreotide attenuated the apoptotic capacity of LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells, led to the up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein level while cut down the protein levels of Bax and cleaved caspase3. Remarkably, the expression of autophagy-related protein LC3II/I and Beclin1 was elevated after Octreotide administration. Importantly, the suppressive effects of Octreotide on the inflammation and apoptosis of LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells was abrogated by 3-MA. Further experiments suggested that Octreotide downregulated p-AKT and mTOR expression in LPS-stimulated BEAS-2B cells. SC79 addition inhibited autophagy, evidenced by downregulated LC3II/I and Beclin1 expression while rapamycin presented the opposite effects. To conclude, Octreotide activates autophagy to alleviate LPS-induced pulmonary epithelial cell injury by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 infects the human kidney and drives fibrosis in kidney organoids</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35032430/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COVID-19 patients present tubulo-interstitial kidney fibrosis compared with controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates profibrotic signaling in human kidney organoids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection can be inhibited by a protease blocker in human kidney organoids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidney failure is frequently observed during and after COVID-19, but it remains elusive whether this is a direct effect of the virus. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects kidney cells and is associated with increased tubule-interstitial kidney fibrosis in patient autopsy samples. To study direct effects of the virus on the kidney independent of systemic effects of COVID-19, we infected human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived kidney organoids with SARS-CoV-2. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicated injury and dedifferentiation of infected cells with activation of profibrotic signaling pathways. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection also led to increased collagen 1 protein expression in organoids. A SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor was able to ameliorate the infection of kidney cells by SARS-CoV-2. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect kidney cells and induce cell injury with subsequent fibrosis. These data could explain both acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and the development of chronic kidney disease in long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disulfiram attenuates MCMV-Induced pneumonia by inhibition of NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway in immunocompromised mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disulfiram (DSF) attenuated MCMV-infected pneumonia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSF suppressed NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway in MCMV-infected mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSF inhibited inflammatory response in MCMV-infected BMDMs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSF reduced viral loads in MCMV-infected mice and BMDMs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals is associated with damaging hyperinflammation and leads to high morbidity and mortality. It is urgently needed to develop new strategies to treat CMV-induced pneumonia. As disulfiram (DSF) reportedly inhibits inflammatory responses in different disease models, its therapeutic effects in CMV-induced pneumonia are proposed. In this study, we demonstrated that DSF effectively attenuated pulmonary injury and improved survival in murine CMV (MCMV) pneumonia model. DSF treatment inhibited lung inflammatory responses, e.g. reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokine, and lowering the accumulation of leukocytes in the lung. Similar to the in vivo results, DSF attenuated inflammatory responses and modulated NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in MCMV-infected BMDMs. Furthermore, DSF reduced pulmonary fibrosis and viral loads in MCMV pneumonia mice and BMDMs. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory effects of DSF may due to its regulating NF-κB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Collectively, our results suggest that DSF-mediated anti-hyperinflammatory effects have potentials for therapy of human CMV pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exploring the molecular mechanisms of the inhibition of acrolein-induced BEAS-2B cytotoxicity by luteolin using network pharmacology and cell biology technology</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34958803/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acrolein is a highly reactive unsaturated hazardous air pollutant, which is extremely irritating to the respiratory tract. Luteolin, an active flavonoid compound, possesses multiple biological activities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mechanism of the inhibition of acrolein-induced human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells cytotoxicity by luteolin using network pharmacology and cell biology technology. Firstly, network pharmacology results indicated that oxidative stress processes might play an important role in luteolin inhibiting lung injury. Next, it was verified at the cellular level. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation increased, glutathione (GSH) level decreased after exposure to acrolein. MAPK signaling pathways were activated, which activated downstream IκBα/NF-κB signaling pathways. Meanwhile, acrolein caused oxidative DNA damage and double-strand breaks, induced DNA damage response (DDR) and apoptosis. These adverse effects were significantly reversed by luteolin, which inhibited the activation of MAPK/IκBα/NF-κB and DDR pathways, and reduced the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Moreover, luteolin also had a similar effect to antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in the regulation of signaling transduction mechanisms, which indicated that the regulation of oxidative stress played an important role in the process. These results provide an experimental basis for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the inhibition of acrolein-induced BEAS-2B cytotoxicity with luteolin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DDR1 contributes to kidney inflammation and fibrosis by promoting the phosphorylation of BCR and STAT3</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34941574/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by collagen, contributes to chronic kidney disease. However, its role in acute kidney injury and subsequent development of kidney fibrosis is not clear. Thus, we performed a model of severe ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury that progressed to kidney fibrosis in WT and Ddr1-null mice. We showed that Ddr1-null mice had reduced acute tubular injury, inflammation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis with overall decreased renal monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) levels and STAT3 activation. We identified breakpoint cluster region (BCR) protein as a phosphorylated target of DDR1 that controls MCP-1 production in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. DDR1-induced BCR phosphorylation or BCR downregulation increased MCP-1 secretion, suggesting that BCR negatively regulates the levels of MCP-1. Mechanistically, phosphorylation or downregulation of BCR increased β-catenin activity and in turn MCP-1 production. Finally, we showed that DDR1-mediated STAT3 activation was required to stimulate the secretion of TGF-β. Thus, DDR1 contributes to acute and chronic kidney injury by regulating BCR and STAT3 phosphorylation and in turn the production of MCP-1 and TGF-β. These findings identify DDR1 an attractive therapeutic target for ameliorating both proinflammatory and profibrotic signaling in kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anoikis is a programmed cell death occurring upon cell detachment from the correct extracellular matrix, thus disrupting integrin ligation. It is a critical mechanism in preventing dysplastic cell growth or attachment to an inappropriate matrix. Anoikis prevents detached epithelial cells from colonizing elsewhere and is thus essential for tissue homeostasis and development. As anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, two features associated with anoikis resistance, are crucial steps during tumour progression and metastatic spreading of cancer cells, anoikis deregulation has now evoked particular attention from the scientific community. The aim of this review is to analyse the molecular mechanisms governing both anoikis and anoikis resistance, focusing on their regulation in physiological processes, as well as in several diseases, including metastatic cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impact of Reverse Triggering Dyssynchrony during Lung-Protective Ventilation on Diaphragm Function: An Experimental Model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34941477/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34941477/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Reverse triggering dyssynchrony (RT) is a patient-ventilator interaction where a respiratory muscle contraction is triggered by a passive mechanical insufflation. Its impact on diaphragm structure and function is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; To establish an animal model of RT with lung injury receiving lung-protective ventilation and to assess its impact on the structure and function of the diaphragm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Lung injury was induced by surfactant depletion and high-stress ventilation in 32 ventilated pigs. Animals were allocated to receive passive mechanical ventilation (Vt: 10 ml/kg; respiratory rate [RR]: 30-35 breaths/min; n = 8) or a more lung-protective strategy (Vt: 6-8 ml/kg; n = 24) with adjustments in RR to facilitate the occurrence of RT for 3 hours. Diaphragm function (transdiaphragmatic pressure [Pdi] during phrenic nerve stimulation [force/frequency curve]) and structure (biopsies) were assessed. The impact of RT on diaphragm function was analyzed according to the breathing effort assessed by the pressure-time product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with passive ventilation, the protective ventilation group with RT received significantly lower Vt (7 vs. 10 ml/kg) and higher RR (45 vs. 31 breaths/min). An entrainment pattern of 1:1 was the most frequently occurring in 83% of the animals. Breathing effort induced by RT was highly variable across animals. RT with the lowest tercile of breathing effort was associated with 23% higher twitch Pdi compared with passive ventilation, whereas RT with high breathing effort was associated with a 10% lower twitch Pdi and a higher proportion of abnormal muscle fibers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In a reproducible animal model of RT with variable levels of breathing effort and entrainment patterns, RT with high effort is associated with impaired diaphragm function, whereas RT with low effort is associated with preserved diaphragm force.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Application of Mesenchymal Stem Cells During Machine Perfusion: An Emerging Novel Strategy for Organ Preservation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35024039/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although solid organ transplantation remains the definitive management for patients with end-stage organ failure, this ultimate treatment has been limited by the number of acceptable donor organs. Therefore, efforts have been made to expand the donor pool by utilizing marginal organs from donation after circulatory death or extended criteria donors. However, marginal organs are susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and entail higher requirements for organ preservation. Recently, machine perfusion has emerged as a novel preservation strategy for marginal grafts. This technique continually perfuses the organs to mimic the physiologic condition, allows the evaluation of pretransplant graft function, and more excitingly facilitates organ reconditioning during perfusion with pharmacological, gene, and stem cell therapy. As mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have anti-oxidative, immunomodulatory, and regenerative properties, mounting studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of MSCs on organ IRI and solid organ transplantation. Therefore, MSCs are promising candidates for organ reconditioning during machine perfusion. This review provides an overview of the application of MSCs combined with machine perfusion for lung, kidney, liver, and heart preservation and reconditioning. Promising preclinical results highlight the potential clinical translation of this innovative strategy to improve the quality of marginal grafts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homoeostasis and health of multicellular organisms with multiple organs depends on interorgan communication. Tissue injury in one organ disturbs this homoeostasis and can lead to disease in multiple organs, or multiorgan failure. Many routes of interorgan crosstalk during homoeostasis are relatively well known, but interorgan crosstalk in disease still lacks understanding. In particular, how tissue injury in one organ can drive injury at remote sites and trigger multiorgan failure with high mortality is poorly understood. As examples, acute kidney injury can trigger acute lung injury and cardiovascular dysfunction; pneumonia, sepsis or liver failure conversely can cause kidney failure; lung transplantation very frequently triggers acute kidney injury. Mechanistically, interorgan crosstalk after tissue injury could involve soluble mediators and their target receptors, cellular mediators, in particular immune cells, as well as newly identified neuro-immune connections. In this review, I will focus the discussion of deleterious interorgan crosstalk and its mechanistic concepts on one example, acute kidney injury-induced remote lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance:&lt;/em&gt; Peucedanum praeruptorum seed root is a common medicinal herb with antipyretic, expectorant, antitussive, and therapeutic effects against bronchitis and furuncle. The roots of this herb contain many coumarin compounds, including pteryxin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim of this study:&lt;/em&gt; To investigate whether pteryxin can alleviate the LPS-induced lung injury and the mechanism involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Material and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male BALB/C mice were orally given sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na) (0.5%, 1mL/100g) and pteryxin (suspended in CMC-Na; 0.5%) at 5, 10, 25 mg/kg once daily for 7 days. Subsequently, the mice received a single intratracheal instillation of 5 mg/kg LPS or saline as the control. After 8 hours, the mice were sacrificed to collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues. These samples were used to determine the lung W/D (wet/dry) weight ratio, total protein (TP) levels, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) and expression of protein involved in MAPK/NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome. H&amp;amp;E staining was carried out on tissue sections to explore the pathological alterations induced by LPS. The protein expression of F4/80 and NLRP3 in lung tissues was analyzed using immunohistochemical staining. The binding of pteryxin to target proteins (MAPK, NF-κB and NLRP3) was determined based on molecular docking tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Treatment with pteryxin reduced the lung W/D weight ratio, total protein (TP) level and levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1 β) significantly. Therefore, it ameliorated LPS-induced inflammatory response in BALB/C mice. Moreover, pteryxin suppressed LPS-induced upregulation of proteins involved in MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The expression level of F4/80 and NLRP3 was also downregulated by pteryxin pretreatment in lung tissues. Docking analysis revealed that pteryxin bound to target proteins (MAPK, NF- κB and NLRP3) with a fit-well pattern .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Pteryxin may attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury by dampening MAPK/NF-κB signaling and NLRP 3 inflammasome activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most prevalent and complex clinical syndromes with high morbidity and mortality. The traditional diagnosis parameters are insufficient regarding specificity and sensitivity, and therefore, novel biomarkers and their facile and rapid applications are being sought to improve the diagnostic procedures. The biosensors, which are employed on the basis of electrochemistry, plasmonics, molecular probes, and nanoparticles, are the prominent ways of developing point-of-care devices, along with the mutual integration of efficient surface chemistry strategies. In this manner, biosensing platforms hold pivotal significance in detecting and quantifying novel AKI biomarkers to improve diagnostic interventions, potentially accelerating clinical management to control the injury in a timely manner. In this review, novel diagnostic platforms and their manufacturing processes are presented comprehensively. Furthermore, strategies to boost their effectiveness are also indicated with several applications. To maximize these efforts, we also review various biosensing approaches with a number of biorecognition elements (e.g., antibodies, aptamers, and molecular imprinting molecules), as well as benchmark their features such as robustness, stability, and specificity of these platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exploring population pharmacokinetic models in patients treated with vancomycin during continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34930430/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Therapeutic antibiotic dose monitoring can be particularly challenging in septic patients requiring renal replacement therapy. Our aim was to conduct an exploratory population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis on PK of vancomycin following intermittent infusion in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF); focussing on the influence of dialysis-related covariates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; This was a retrospective single-centre tertiary level intensive care unit (ICU) study, which included patients treated concurrently with vancomycin and CVVHDF between January 2015 and July 2016. We extracted clinical, laboratory and dialysis data from the electronic healthcare record (EHR), using strict inclusion criteria. A population PK analysis was conducted with a one-compartment model using the PMetrics population PK modelling package. A base structural model was developed, with further analyses including clinical and dialysis-related data to improve model prediction through covariate inclusion. The final selected model simulated patient concentrations using probability of target attainment (PTA) plots to investigate the probability of different dosing regimens achieving target therapeutic concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 106 vancomycin dosing intervals (155 levels) in 24 patients were examined. An acceptable 1-compartment base model was produced (Plots of observed vs. population predicted concentrations (Obs-Pred) &lt;em&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0.78). No continuous covariates explored resulted in a clear improvement over the base model. Inclusion of anticoagulation modality and vasopressor use as categorical covariates resulted in similar PK parameter estimates, with a trend towards lower parameter estimate variability when using regional citrate anti-coagulation or without vasopressor use. Simulations using PTA plots suggested that a 2 g loading dose followed by 750 mg 12 hourly as maintenance dose, commencing 12 h after loading, is required to achieve adequate early target trough concentrations of at least 15 mg/L.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; PTA simulations suggest that acceptable trough vancomycin concentrations can be achieved early in treatment with a 2 g loading dose and maintenance dose of 750 mg 12 hourly for critically ill patients on CVVHDF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JFNE-A isolated from Jing-Fang n-butanol extract attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and the NF-κB signaling pathway via promotion of autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35026506/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35026506/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Jing-Fang powder consists of Jingjie (Nepeta tenuifolia Benth, (Lamiaceae)). and Fangfeng (Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz.) Schischk, (Apiaceae)) Previous studies have revealed that the Jing-Fang powder n-butanol extract (JFNE) has anti-acute lung injury (ALI) and anti-inflammatory properties; however, the active ingredient and mechanism remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of a bioactive fraction obtained from JFNE(JFNE-A) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice and explored the underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design:&lt;/em&gt; The anti-acute lung injury effect and mechanism of JFNE-A was investigated by prophylactic administration of JFNE-A in mice with LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The expression levels of myeloperoxidase(MPO) in lung tissues of mice and interleukin(IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α, IL-1β, IL-5, interferon (IFN)-γ, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, and MIP-1β in bronchi alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were detected by reagent kit and the histological changes were examined by hematoxylin and eosin (H &amp;amp; E) for general histopathological conditions under a light microscope. In addition, the ultrastructure of the cells in lung tissues were observed and photographed under a transmission electron microscope. The expression levels of protein were detected via Western blotting and the mRNA expression of relative genes were determined of via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). What&amp;rsquo;s more, we also further clarified the potential targets of JFNE-A through network pharmacology analysis, which could be utilized in ALI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our results showed that pretreatment with JFNE-A for 7 days significantly reduced the lung pathological injury score, alleviated pulmonary edema, and decreased the lung tissue MPO level. Mechanistically, JFNE-A dramatically downregulated the protein levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, M-CSF, and IFN-γ in BALF and mRNA expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ in lung tissues. JFNE-A also significantly lowered the protein levels of iNOS and phosphorylated NF-κB (p65) and mRNA expression levels of iNOS, Rela, CHUK, and NF-κB1, and also elevated the protein expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and SOD1 and the mRNA expression levels of Nrf2, Hmox1, and Keap-1 in the lungs. Moreover, JFNE-A significantly decreased the protein expression of p62 and increased the ratio of LC3II/LC3I. It also upregulated the mRNA expression levels of Atg5 and Beclin-1, whereas it reduced the mRNA expression level of SQSTM1 and increased autophagosome structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Overall, treatment with JFNE-A ameliorated LPS-induced ALI in mice by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathways and promoting Nrf2 signaling pathways by accelerating autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent worldwide survey indicates an international diversity in net ultrafiltration (UFNET) practices for the treatment of fluid overload in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). The sub-analysis of the survey has demonstrated that maximum doses of furosemide used before determination of diuretic resistance are lower in Japan than those prescribed worldwide and UFNET is lower but is initiated earlier. In contrast, the interval during which practitioners evaluate fluid balance is longer. The characterization of RRT in critically ill patients in Japan should unveil more appropriate approaches to the successful treatment of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Punicalagin alleviates renal injury via the gut-kidney axis in high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34989745/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic renal injury was associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier. Punicalagin (PU) from pomegranates potentially impacts the microbial ecosystem, intestinal barrier, and renal function. Therefore, we hypothesized that PU may improve diabetic renal injury by modulating the gut-kidney axis. The present study evaluated the effect of PU on the gut-kidney axis and kidney function in a diabetic renal injury mouse model induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Mice were fed a HFD without PU or with at doses of 50 and 100 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for 8 weeks. Targeted metabolomics by GC-MS and 16S rRNA sequencing were implemented to determine short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and microbes. Further RNA sequencing analyses were performed to determine which differentially expressed genes were changed by PU. Compared with the DM model group, PU supplementation improved diabetic renal injury, ameliorated kidney architecture and function, and reshaped gut microbial ecology. Additionally, PU reversed HFD-induced gut barrier dysfunction, promoted cecal SCFA concentrations and inhibited serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and diamine oxidase (DAO) levels. Moreover, correlation analysis found that cecal SCFAs were significantly negatively correlated with inflammation-related genes in the kidney. The present results indicated that PU, a promising bioactive polyphenol, successfully improved diabetic renal injury, most likely through the gut-kidney axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RBC-hitchhiking chitosan nanoparticles loading methylprednisolone for lung-targeting delivery</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34933051/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyper-inflammation associated with cytokine storm syndrome causes high mortality in patients with COVID-19. Glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS), effectively inhibit this inflammatory response. However, frequent and chronic administration of glucocorticoids at high doses leads to hormone dependence and serious side effects. The aim of the present study was to combine nanoparticles with erythrocytes for the targeted delivery of MPSS to the lungs. Chitosan nanoparticles loading MPSS (MPSS-CSNPs) were prepared and adsorbed on the surface of red blood cells (RBC-MPSS-CSNPs) by non-covalent interaction. In vivo pharmacokinetic study indicated that RBC-hitchhiking could significantly reduce the plasma concentration of the drug and prolong the circulation time. The mean residence time (MRT) and area under the curve (AUC) of the RBC-MPSS-CSNPs group were significantly higher than those of the MPSS-CSNPs group and the MPSS injection group. Moreover, in vivo imaging and tissue distribution indicated that RBC-hitchhiking facilitated the accumulation of nanoparticles loading fluorescein in the lung, preventing uptake of these nanoparticles by the liver. Furthermore, compared with the MPSS-CSNPs and MPSS treatment groups, treatment with RBC-MPSS-CSNPs considerably inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, and consequently attenuated lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide in rats. Therefore, RBC-hitchhiking is a potentially effective strategy for the delivery of nanoparticles to the lungs for the treatment of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scaffold polarity proteins Par3A and Par3B share redundant functions while Par3B acts independent of atypical protein kinase C/Par6 in podocytes to maintain the kidney filtration barrier</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34929254/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glomerular diseases are a major cause for chronic kidney disorders. In most cases podocyte injury is causative for disease development. Cytoskeletal rearrangements and morphological changes are hallmark features of podocyte injury and result in dedifferentiation and loss of podocytes. Here, we establish a link between the Par3 polarity complex and actin regulators necessary to establish and maintain podocyte architecture by utilizing mouse and Drosophila models to characterize the functional role of Par3A and Par3B and its fly homologue Bazooka in vivo. Only simultaneous inactivation of both Par3 proteins caused a severe disease phenotype. Rescue experiments in Drosophila nephrocytes revealed atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-Par6 dependent and independent effects. While Par3A primarily acts via aPKC-Par6, Par3B function was independent of Par6. Actin-associated synaptopodin protein levels were found to be significantly upregulated upon loss of Par3A/B in mouse podocytes. Tropomyosin2, which shares functional similarities with synaptopodin, was also elevated in Bazooka depleted nephrocytes. The simultaneous depletion of Bazooka and Tropomyosin2 resulted in a partial rescue of the Bazooka knockdown phenotype and prevented increased Rho1-GTP, a member of a GTPase protein family regulating the cytoskeleton. The latter contribute to the nephrocyte phenotype observed upon loss of Bazooka. Thus, we demonstrate that Par3 proteins share a high functional redundancy but also have specific functions. Par3A acts in an aPKC-Par6 dependent way and regulates RhoA-GTP levels, while Par3B exploits Par6 independent functions influencing synaptopodin localization. Hence, Par3A and Par3B link elements of polarity signaling and actin regulators to maintain podocyte architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>β2-spectrin (SPTBN1) as a therapeutic target for diet-induced liver disease and preventing cancer development</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34910547/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spanning the spectrin of diet-induced liver disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver diseases associated with lipid accumulation and fibrosis, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), increase risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Rao et al. focused on the role of β2-spectrin (SPTBN1), a protein that promotes TGF-β–SMAD3 signaling, in liver disease and tumor formation. SPTBN1, CASPASE-3, and SREBP1 were increased in liver tissue from patients with NASH. Liver-specific &lt;em&gt;Sptbn1&lt;/em&gt; KO mice were protected from diet-induced NASH, NAFLD, and HCC. siRNA targeting SPTBN1 reduced SREBP1 activation in HCC cells, altered fatty acid metabolism- and fibrosis-associated gene expression in a human cell culture model of NASH, and attenuated diet-induced NAFLD in mice. Results identify how SPTBN1 regulates SREBP activity and support therapeutic targeting of SPTBN1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver cancer is increasing. De novo lipogenesis and fibrosis contribute to disease progression and cancerous transformation. Here, we found that β2-spectrin (SPTBN1) promotes sterol regulatory element (SRE)–binding protein (SREBP)–stimulated lipogenesis and development of liver cancer in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a western diet (WD). Either hepatocyte-specific knockout of SPTBN1 or siRNA-mediated therapy protected mice from HFD/WD-induced obesity and fibrosis, lipid accumulation, and tissue damage in the liver. Biochemical analysis suggested that HFD/WD induces SPTBN1 and SREBP1 cleavage by CASPASE-3 and that the cleaved products interact to promote expression of genes with sterol response elements. Analysis of human NASH tissue revealed increased &lt;em&gt;SPTBN1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CASPASE-3&lt;/em&gt; expression. Thus, our data indicate that SPTBN1 represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention in NASH and liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pathway network of pyroptosis and its potential inhibitors in acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34915124/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a worldwide problem, and there is no effective drug to eliminate AKI. The death of renal cells is an important pathological basis of intrinsic AKI. At present, targeted therapy for TEC death is a research hotspot in AKI therapy. There are many ways of cell death involved in the occurrence and development of AKI, such as apoptosis, necrosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis. This article mainly focuses on the role of pyroptosis in AKI. The assembly and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is a key event in the occurrence of pyroptosis, which is affected by many factors, such as the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, mitochondrial instability and excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome can trigger its downstream inflammatory cytokines, which will lead to pyroptosis and eventually induce AKI. In this paper, we reviewed the possible mechanism of pyroptosis in AKI and the potential effective inhibitors of various key targets in this process. It may provide potential therapeutic targets for novel intrinsic AKI therapies based on pyroptosis, so as to develop better therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5-Hydroxymethylfurfural Alleviates Inflammatory Lung Injury by Inhibiting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34966742/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is a common reaction product during heat processing and the preparation of many types of foods and Traditional Chinese Medicine formulations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of 5-HMF on endotoxin-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the underlying mechanisms. Our findings indicate that 5-HMF attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice by mitigating alveolar destruction, neutrophil infiltration and the release of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the activation of macrophages and human monocytes in response to LPS was remarkably suppressed by 5-HMF in vitro through inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The inhibitory effect of 5-HMF on NLRP3 inflammasome was reversed by overexpressing ATF4 or CHOP, indicating the involvement of ER stress in the negative regulation of 5-HMF on NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation. Consistent with this, the ameliorative effect of 5-HMF on in vivo pulmonary dysfunction were reversed by the ER stress inducer tunicamycin. In conclusion, our findings elucidate the anti-inflammatory and protective efficacy of 5-HMF in LPS-induced acute lung injury, and also demonstrate the key mechanism of its action against NLRP3 inflammasome-related inflammatory disorders via the inhibition of ER stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dimethyl fumarate attenuates LPS induced septic acute kidney injury by suppression of NFκB p65 phosphorylation and macrophage activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34915410/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Septic acute kidney injury (AKI) always accounts for high mortality of septic patients in ICU. Due to its not well understood mechanism for infection and immune-regulation in kidney dysfunction, there is a lack of effective therapy without side effects. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) as an immunomodulatory molecule has been approved for treatment to multiple sclerosis. However, the therapeutic effect and immunomodulatory role underlying DMF action in septic AKI is unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of DMF in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic AKI involving macrophage regulation. In current study, we administered DMF by oral gavage to mice with LPS-induced AKI, then harvested serum and kidney at three different time points. We further isolated Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from mice and stimulated them with LPS followed by DMF treatment. To explore immunomodulatory role of DMF in macrophages, we depleted macrophages in mice using liposomal clodronate after DMF treatment upon LPS-induced septic AKI. Then we observed that DMF attenuated renal dysfunction and murine pathological kidney injury after LPS injection. DMF could inhibit translocation of phosphorylated NF-κB p65 and suppress macrophage activation in LPS-induced AKI. DMF reduced the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 whereas increased the secretion of IL-10 and Arg-1 in BMDMs after LPS stimulation. DMF also inhibited NF-κB p65 phosphorylation in BMDMs after LPS stimulation. Importantly, the effect of DMF against LPS-induced AKI, macrophage activation, and translocation of phosphorylated NF-κB p65 was impaired upon macrophage depletion. Thus, DMF could attenuate LPS-induced septic AKI by suppression of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and macrophage activation. This work suggested the potential therapeutic role of DMF for patients in ICU threatened by septic AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exercise-Induced Cardiac Troponin Elevations: From Underlying Mechanisms to Clinical Relevance</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34898243/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serological assessment of cardiac troponins (cTn) is the gold standard to assess myocardial injury in clinical practice. A greater magnitude of acutely or chronically elevated cTn concentrations is associated with lower event-free survival in patients and the general population. Exercise training is known to improve cardiovascular function and promote longevity, but exercise can produce an acute rise in cTn concentrations, which may exceed the upper reference limit in a substantial number of individuals. Whether exercise-induced cTn elevations are attributable to a physiological or pathological response and if they are clinically relevant has been debated for decades. Thus far, exercise-induced cTn elevations have been viewed as the only benign form of cTn elevations. However, recent studies report intriguing findings that shed new light on the underlying mechanisms and clinical relevance of exercise-induced cTn elevations. We will review the biochemical characteristics of cTn assays, key factors determining the magnitude of postexercise cTn concentrations, the release kinetics, underlying mechanisms causing and contributing to exercise-induced cTn release, and the clinical relevance of exercise-induced cTn elevations. We will also explain the association with cardiac function, correlates with (subclinical) cardiovascular diseases and exercise-induced cTn elevations predictive value for future cardiovascular events. Last, we will provide recommendations for interpretation of these findings and provide direction for future research in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single Treatment of Vitamin D3 Ameliorates LPS-Induced Acute Lung Injury through Changing Lung Rodentibacter abundance</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34894076/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by severe inflammation. Vitamin D3 is discussed to reduce inflammation in ALI, but the mechanism is not well understood. This study assesses the effect of different calcitriol administration strategies on inflammation and the lung microbiota composition in ALI. In a mouse model, the alveolus and airway pathology are assessed by immunohistology. mRNA expression is determined by Real-Time Quantitative PCR and protein expressions is detected by Western-blotting. The composition of microbiota is performed by 16s DNA high-throughput sequencing. Short-term vitamin D3 supplementation prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI by preventing pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). In contrast, long-term treatment over 3 days, 6 days, or 10 days had no such effect. Short-term vitamin D3, but not long-term pretreatment significantly reduces the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, but upregulates the phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor-κ-gene binding. Furthermore, an increased relative abundance of Rodentibacter genus in LPS-challenged mice bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is observed, which is sensitive to short-term vitamin D3 treatment, effectively alleviating the Rodentibacter abundance. Correlation analysis shows that the load of Rodentibacter positively correlated with the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α gene expression. The data support that a single administration of vitamin D3 may work as an adjuvant therapy for acute lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comparison of 3D airway models for the assessment of fibrogenic chemicals</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34902520/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts play key roles in pulmonary fibrosis and are involved in fibrotic signaling and production of the extracellular matrix (ECM), respectively. Recently, 3D airway models consisting of both cell types have been developed to evaluate the fibrotic responses while facilitating cell-cell crosstalk. This study aimed to evaluate the fibrotic responses in these models using different fibrogenic agents, which are known as key events in adverse outcome pathways of pulmonary fibrosis. We quantified cell injury and several sequential steps in fibrogenesis, including inflammation, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), fibroblast activation, and ECM accumulation, using two different 3D airway models, the EpiAirway™-full thickness (Epi/FT) and MucilAir™-human fibroblast (Mucil/HF) models. In the Epi/FT model, fibrogenic agents induced the expression of inflammation and EMT-associated markers, while in the Mucil/HF model, they induced fibroblast activation and ECM accumulation. Using this information, we conducted gene ontology term network analysis. In the Epi/FT model, the terms associated with cell migration and response to stimulus made up a large part of the network. In the Mucil/HF model, the terms associated with ECM organization and cell differentiation and proliferation constituted a great part of the network. Collectively, our data suggest that polyhexamethyleneguanidine phosphate and bleomycin induce different responses in the two 3D airway models. While Epi/FT was associated with inflammatory/EMT-associated responses, Mucil/HF was associated with fibroblast-associated responses. This study will provide an important basis for selecting proper 3D airway models and fibrogenic agents to further research or screen chemicals causing inhalation toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The systemic processes involved in the manifestation of life-threatening COVID-19 and in disease recovery are still incompletely understood, despite investigations focusing on the dysregulation of immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To define hallmarks of severe COVID-19 in acute disease (n = 58) and in disease recovery in convalescent patients (n = 28) from Hannover Medical School, we used flow cytometry and proteomics data with unsupervised clustering analyses. In our observational study, we combined analyses of immune cells and cytokine/chemokine networks with endothelial activation and injury. ICU patients displayed an altered immune signature with prolonged lymphopenia but the expansion of granulocytes and plasmablasts along with activated and terminally differentiated T and NK cells and high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The core signature of seven plasma proteins revealed a highly inflammatory microenvironment in addition to endothelial injury in severe COVID-19. Changes within this signature were associated with either disease progression or recovery. In summary, our data suggest that besides a strong inflammatory response, severe COVID-19 is driven by endothelial activation and barrier disruption, whereby recovery depends on the regeneration of the endothelial integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing partial protection against pediatric tuberculosis, vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has been reported to confer nonspecific resistance to unrelated pulmonary pathogens, a phenomenon attributed to the induction of long-lasting alterations within the myeloid cell compartment. Here, we demonstrate that intravenous, but not subcutaneous, inoculation of BCG protects human-ACE2 transgenic mice against lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) and results in reduced viral loads in non-transgenic animals infected with an α variant. The observed increase in host resistance was associated with reductions in SCV2-induced tissue pathology, inflammatory cell recruitment, and cytokine production that multivariate analysis revealed as only partially related to diminished viral load. We propose that this protection stems from BCG-induced alterations in the composition and function of the pulmonary cellular compartment that impact the innate response to the virus and ensuing immunopathology. While intravenous BCG vaccination is not a clinically acceptable practice, our findings provide an experimental model for identifying mechanisms by which nonspecific stimulation of the pulmonary immune response promotes host resistance to SCV2 lethality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeletal muscle is a regulator of the body&amp;rsquo;s energy expenditure and metabolism. Abnormal regulation of skeletal muscle-specific genes leads to various muscle diseases. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to play important roles in muscle growth and muscle atrophy. To explore the potential function of muscle-associated lncRNA, we analyzed our previous RNA-sequencing data and selected the lncRNA (&lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt;) as the research object. In this study, we report that &lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt; is specifically enriched in skeletal muscle, and its transcriptional activity is positively regulated by transcription factor SP1. &lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt; regulates myoblast proliferation and differentiation &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt; reduces intramuscular fat deposition, activates slow-twitch muscle phenotype, and inhibits muscle atrophy. Mechanistically, &lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt; binds to sarcoplasmic/ER calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2) protein to enhance SERCA2 protein stability and increase SERCA2 activity. Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt; improves mitochondrial efficiency possibly through a SERCA2-mediated activation of the AMPK pathway. Our findings provide a strategy for using &lt;em&gt;LncEDCH1&lt;/em&gt; as an effective regulator for the treatment of muscle atrophy and energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rescuing ischemic stroke by biomimetic nanovesicles through accelerated thrombolysis and sequential ischemia-reperfusion protection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational design of nanomedicine to accelerate thrombolysis and sequentially avoid thrombolysis-mediated reperfusion injury is still a challenge. Here, we develop a biomimetic nanovesicle (tPA/MNP@PM, tMP) by simple encapsulating melanin nanoparticles (MNP) and tPA with a platelet membrane vesicle (PM), which integrates the thrombus targeting property of PM, the photothermal conversion performance and free radical scavenging property of natural melanin for cascaded ischemic stroke treatment. Benefiting from natural thrombus-targeted adhesion capability of PM, nanovesicles could efficiently target thrombus site. Then near-infrared (NIR) mediated photothermal of MNP could lead to rupture of nanovesicles, thus achieving precise release of tPA in thrombus. Interestingly, local hyperthermia also increases the activity of tPA for accelerating thrombolysis. Afterwards, site specific released MNP (4.5 nm) accompanied by hemoperfusion can cross the BBB and accumulate in cerebral ischemia site, scavenging various free radicals and suppressing inflammation- and immune response-induced injury to achieve neuroprotection after thrombolysis. In addition, the biomimetic nanovesicle could block tPA-induced brain hemorrhage after stroke to improve thrombolytic therapy. The evaluation in ischemic stroke mice confirmed that the simple-prepared nanomedicine with cascaded thrombus targeting, precise thrombolysis and ischemia-reperfusion protection properties can significantly enhance the treatment effect of ischemic stroke. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Ischemic stroke is recognized as a leading cause of death and disability in the world. Rational design of nanomedicine to accelerate thrombolysis and sequentially avoid thrombolysis-mediated reperfusion injury is still a challenge. Herein, a biomimetic nanovesicle (tMP) was developed for sequential ischemic stroke treatment. It could overcome the drawbacks of free tPA for safe thrombolysis: i) platelet membrane biomimetic coating significantly increases thrombus targeting; ii) NIR-mediated photothermal of natural melanin precise controlled release of tPA in thrombus in situ, and local hyperthermia also increases the thrombolytic activity of tPA. Notably, released melanin nanoparticles (4.5 nm) accompanied by hemoperfusion can across BBB and avoid ischemia-reperfusion injury through free radical scavenging and inflammation/immune response suppression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors as an early, first-line therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34894038/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have recently been recommended as a foundational therapy for patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) because of their favourable effects on mortality, clinical events and quality of life. While clinical practice guidelines have recommended dapagliflozin or empagliflozin in all patients with HFrEF, or sotagliflozin in those with HFrEF and concomitant diabetes, the timing and practical integration of these drugs in clinical practice is less well defined. We propose that these drugs are candidates for early, upfront administration to patients with newly diagnosed HFrEF and for patients hospitalized with HF. Growing evidence has established early benefits, with clinically meaningful reductions in clinical events that reach statistical significance within days to weeks, following dapagliflozin, empagliflozin or, in diabetic patients, sotagliflozin initiation. Secondly, although major clinical trials have tested these drugs in patients already receiving background HF therapy, secondary analyses showed that their efficacy is independent of that. Third, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally safe and well tolerated, with clinical trial data reporting minimal effects on blood pressure, glycaemia-related adverse events, and no excess in acute kidney injury. Rather, they exert renal protective effects and reduce risk of hyperkalaemia, properties that favour initiation, tolerance and persistence of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. This review supports the early initiation of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin (or sotagliflozin limited to patients with diabetes) to rapidly improve clinical outcome and quality of life of HFrEF patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High throughput data-based, toxicity pathway-oriented development of a quantitative adverse outcome pathway network linking AHR activation to lung damages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34906874/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34906874/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An AOP network model was constructed concerning AHR-initiated lung damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gene expression signatures of toxicity pathways represented the molecular events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AOP was validated using high throughput data combined with machine learning models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AOP quantitative evaluation was proposed using RNA-seq technique and bioassays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantitative adverse outcome pathway (qAOP) is proposed to inform dose-responses at multiple biological levels for the purpose of toxicity prediction. So far, qAOP models concerning human health are scarce. Previously, we proposed 5 key molecular pathways that led aryl hydrogen receptor (AHR) activation to lung damages. The present study assembled an AOP network based on the gene expression signatures of these toxicity pathways, and validated the network using publicly available high throughput data combined with machine learning models. In addition, the AOP network was quantitatively evaluated with omics approaches and bioassays, using 16HBE-CYP1A1 cells exposed to benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a prototypical AHR activator. Benchmark dose (BMD) analysis of transcriptomics revealed that AHR gene held the lowest BMD value, whereas AHR pathway held the lowest point of departure (PoD) compared to the other 4 pathways. Targeted bioassays were further performed to quantitatively understand the cellular responses, including ROS generation, DNA damage, interleukin-6 production, and extracellular matrix increase marked by collagen expression. Eventually, response-response relationships were plotted using nonlinear model fitting. The present study developed a highly reliable AOP model concerning human health, and validated as well as quantitatively evaluated it, and such a method is likely to be adoptable for risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Frontiers in Functional and Molecular Imaging of the Acutely Injured Lung: Pathophysiological Insights and Research Applications</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34955883/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review focuses on the advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of ventilator-induced and acute lung injury that have been afforded by technological development of imaging methods over the last decades. Examples of such advances include the establishment of regional lung mechanical strain as a determinant of ventilator-induced lung injury, the relationship between alveolar recruitment and overdistension, the regional vs. diffuse nature of pulmonary involvement in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the identification of the physiological determinants of the response to recruitment interventions, and the pathophysiological significance of metabolic alterations in the acutely injured lung. Taken together, these advances portray multimodality imaging as the next frontier to both advance knowledge of the pathophysiology of these conditions and to tailor treatment to the individual patient&amp;rsquo;s condition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interferon-α exerts proinflammatory properties in experimental radiation-induced esophagitis: Possible involvement of plasmacytoid dendritic cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34890590/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irradiation to esophagus induce IFN-α in the esophageal mucosa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFN-α induce and promote inflammation in radiation-induced esophagitis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inhibition of IFN-α ameliorate radiation-induced esophagitis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depletion or inactivation of pDC reduce IFN-α in radiation-induced esophagitis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depletion or inactivation of pDC ameliorate radiation-induced esophagitis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced esophagitis, experienced during radiation therapy for lung cancer and head and neck cancer, is a major dose-limiting side effect of the treatment. This study aimed to elucidate the role of interferon-α (IFN-α) in radiation-induced esophagitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 10 and 25Gy of single thoracic irradiation. Esophageal mucosal damage and inflammatory reactions were assessed for 5 days after irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; Irradiation induced esophagitis, characterized by reduction in the thickness of epithelial layer, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, infiltration of inflammatory cells into the esophageal mucosa, and apoptosis of epithelial cells. Irradiation upregulated the level of gene expression for IFN-α in the esophageal tissue, and the neutralizing antibody against IFN-α ameliorated radiation-induced esophageal mucosal damage, while administration of IFN-α receptor agonist (RO8191) had an inverse effect. Depletion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) by anti-CD317 antibody or pharmacological inactivation with bortezomib suppressed radiation-induced mucosal inflammation and damage, accompanied by decrease in IFN-α expression level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; These findings suggest that IFN-α and pDCs exert proinflammatory properties in the pathophysiology of radiation-induced esophagitis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reduction of NETosis by targeting CXCR1/2 reduces thrombosis, lung injury, and mortality in experimental human and murine sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34893315/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) facilitate bacterial clearance but also promote thrombosis and organ injury in sepsis. We quantified ex vivo NET induction in septic humans and murine models of sepsis to identify signalling pathways that may be modulated to improve outcome in human sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; NET formation in human donor neutrophils was quantified after incubation with plasma obtained from patients with sepsis or systemic inflammation (double-blinded assessment of extracellular DNA using immunofluorescence microscopy). NET formation (% neutrophils forming NETs) was correlated with plasma cytokine levels (MultiPlex assay). Experimental sepsis (caecal ligation and puncture or intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli) was assessed in C57/BL6 male mice. The effect of pharmacological inhibition of CXCR1/2 signalling (reparixin) on NET formation, organ injury (hepatic, renal, and cardiac biomarkers), and survival in septic mice was examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; NET formation was higher after incubation with plasma from septic patients (median NETs=25% [10.5-46.5%]), compared with plasma obtained from patients with systemic inflammation (14% [4.0-23.3%]; P=0.02). Similar results were observed after incubation of plasma from mice with neutrophils from septic non-septic mice. Circulating CXCR1/2 ligands correlated with NETosis in patients (interleukin-8; r=0.643) and mice (macrophage inflammatory protein-2; r=0.902). In experimental sepsis, NETs were primarily observed in the lungs, correlating with fibrin deposition (r=0.702) and lung injury (r=0.692). Inhibition of CXCR1/2 using reparixin in septic mice reduced NET formation, multi-organ injury, and mortality, without impairing bacterial clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; CXCR1/2 signalling-induced NET formation is a therapeutic target in sepsis, which may be guided by ex vivo NET assays.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The antifibrotic effect of pheretima protein is mediated by the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathway and attenuates inflammation in bleomycin-induced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34890730/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance:&lt;/em&gt; Pheretima is a traditional Chinese medicine that could treat various lung diseases such as asthma, pneumonia, and lung cancer effectively; however, limited studies on the use of Pheretima protein in the treatment of lung diseases have been conducted to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim of the study:&lt;/em&gt; The aim of this study was to explain the antipulmonary fibrosis mechanism of the Pheretima protein and elucidate its possible cell signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Material and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Fresh pheretima was freeze-dried to obtain the Pheretima protein. Divide C57BL/6 mice into control and bleomycin (BLM)-induced models, pirfenidone, and Pheretima protein-treatment groups. Three weeks later, they were treated with H&amp;amp;E and Masson&amp;rsquo;s trichrome staining to assess lung injury and fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC), realtime-PCR (RT-PCR), and western blotting. Inflammation was assessed using the alveolar lavage fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Pheretima protein inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and reduced inflammation. It also reduced the levels of Smad2/3, pSmad2/3, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1). Thus, our results indicate that Pheretima protein can alleviate BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Pheretima protein inhibits ECM, EMT, and antiinflammatory markers, which in turn ameliorates BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that Pheretima protein can exert its biological activity by downregulating the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of thiamine and vitamin C with or without hydrocortisone coadministration on the treatment of sepsis and septic shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that made a comparative study between the combination therapy of vitamin C and thiamine with or without hydrocortisone and the administration of placebo in patients with sepsis or septic shock. Two reviewers independently performed study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. Both short-term mortality and change in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score from baseline (delta SOFA) were set as the primary outcomes. Secondary endpoints included intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, new onset of acute kidney injury, total adverse events, ICU and hospital length of stay, duration of vasopressor usage and ventilator-free days. Meanwhile, trial sequential analysis was conducted for primary outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Eight RCTs with 1428 patients were included in the current study. The results showed no significant reduction of short-term mortality in sepsis and septic shock patients who received combination therapy of vitamin C and thiamine with or without hydrocortisone compared to those with placebo {risk ratio (RR), 1.02 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87 to 1.20], &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.81, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0%; risk difference (RD), 0 [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.05]}. Nevertheless, the combination therapy was associated with significant reduction in SOFA score [mean difference (MD), -0.63, (95% CI, -0.96 to -0.29, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0%] and vasopressors duration (MD, -22.11 [95% CI, -30.46 to -13.77], &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 6%). Additionally, there were no statistical differences in the pooled estimate for other outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In the current meta-analysis, the combination therapy of vitamin C and thiamine, with or without hydrocortisone had no impact on short-term mortality when compared with placebo, but was associated with significant reduction in SOFA score among patients with sepsis and septic shock.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fighting the Fiber: Targeting Collagen in Lung Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34861139/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organ fibrosis is characterized by epithelial injury and aberrant tissue repair, where activated effector cells, mostly fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, excessively deposit collagen into the extracellular matrix. Fibrosis frequently results in organ failure and has been estimated to contribute to at least one-third of all global deaths. Also, lung fibrosis, in particular idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is a fatal disease with rising incidence worldwide. As current treatment options targeting fibrogenesis are insufficient, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. During the last decade, several studies have proposed to target intra- and extracellular components of the collagen biosynthesis, maturation, and degradation machinery. This includes intra- and extracellular targets directly acting on collagen gene products, but also such that anabolize essential building blocks of collagen, in particular glycine (Gly) and proline (Pro) biosynthetic enzymes. Collagen, however, is a ubiquitous molecule in the body and fulfills essential functions as a macromolecular scaffold, growth factor reservoir, and receptor binding site in virtually every tissue. This review summarizes recent advances and future directions in this field. Evidence for the proposed therapeutic targets and where they currently stand in terms of clinical drug development for treatment of fibrotic disease is provided. The drug targets are furthermore discussed in light of 1) specificity for collagen biosynthesis, maturation, and degradation, and 2) specificity for disease-associated collagen. As therapeutic success and safety of these drugs may largely depend on targeted delivery, different strategies for specific delivery to the main effector cells and the extracellular matrix are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Guidelines emphasize screening people with elevated BP for the presence of end-organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We characterized the prevalence, correlates, and prognosis of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) in the community-based Framingham Study. 7898 participants (mean age 51.6 years, 54% women) underwent assessment for the following HMOD: electrocardiographic and echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal brain imaging findings consistent with vascular injury, increased carotid intima-media thickness, elevated carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, reduced kidney function, microalbuminuria, and low ankle-brachial index. We characterized HMOD prevalence according to blood pressure (BP) categories defined by four international BP guidelines. Participants were followed up for incidence of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The prevalence of HMOD varied positively with systolic BP and pulse pressure but negatively with diastolic BP; it increased with age, was similar in both sexes, and varied across BP guidelines based on their thresholds defining hypertension. Among participants with hypertension, elevated carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity was the most prevalent HMOD (40%-60%), whereas low ankle-brachial index was the least prevalent (&amp;lt;5%). Left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced kidney function, microalbuminuria, increased carotid intima-media thickness, and abnormal brain imaging findings had an intermediate prevalence (20%-40%). HMOD frequently clustered within individuals. On follow-up (median, 14.1 years), there were 384 cardiovascular disease events among 5865 participants with concurrent assessment of left ventricular mass, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, kidney function, and microalbuminuria. For every BP category above optimal (referent group), the presence of HMOD increased cardiovascular disease risk compared with its absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The prevalence of HMOD varies across international BP guidelines based on their different thresholds for defining hypertension. The presence of HMOD confers incremental prognostic information regarding cardiovascular disease risk at every BP category.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Suppressed farnesoid X receptor by iron overload in mice and humans potentiates iron-induced hepatotoxicity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34870866/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Iron overload (IO) is a frequent finding in the general population. As the major iron storage site, the liver is subject to iron toxicity. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates bile acid metabolism and is implicated in various liver diseases. We aimed to determine whether FXR plays a role in regulating iron hepatotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt; Human and mouse hepatocytes were treated with ferric ammonium citrate or iron dextran (FeDx). Mice were orally administered ferrous sulfate or injected i.p. with FeDx. Wild-type and Fxr-/- mice were fed an iron-rich diet for 1 or 5 weeks. Mice fed an iron-rich diet were coadministered the FXR agonist, GW4064. Forced expression of FXR was carried out with recombinant adeno-associated virus 1 week before iron-rich diet feeding. Serum levels of bile acids and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) were quantified in adults with hyperferritinemia and children with β-thalassemia. The data demonstrated that iron suppressed FXR expression and signaling in human and mouse hepatocytes as well as in mouse liver and intestine. FXR deficiency potentiated iron hepatotoxicity, accompanied with hepatic steatosis as well as dysregulated iron and bile acid homeostasis. FXR negatively regulated iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2 and prevented hepatic iron accumulation. Forced FXR expression and ligand activation significantly suppressed iron hepatotoxicity in iron-fed mice. The FXR agonist, GW4064, almost completely restored dysregulated bile acid signaling and metabolic syndrome in iron-fed mice. Conjugated primary bile acids were increased and FGF19 was decreased in serum of adults with hyperferritinemia and children with β-thalassemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; FXR plays a pivotal role in regulating iron homeostasis and protects mice against iron hepatotoxicity. Targeting FXR may represent a therapeutic strategy for IO-associated chronic liver diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to identify miRNAs that regulate AKI and develop their applications as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic agents. First, kidney tissues from two different AKI mouse models, namely, AKI induced by the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causing sepsis (LPS-AKI mice) and AKI induced by renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI-AKI mice), were exhaustively screened for their changes of miRNA expression compared with that of control mice by microarray analysis followed by quantitative RT-PCR. The initial profiling newly identified miRNA-5100, whose expression levels significantly decreased in kidneys in both LPS-AKI mice and IRI-AKI mice. Next, the administration of miRNA-5100-mimic conjugated with a nonviral vector, polyethylenimine nanoparticles (PEI-NPs), via the tail vein significantly induced miRNA-5100 overexpression in the kidney and prevented the development of IRI-AKI mice by inhibiting several apoptosis pathways in vivo. Furthermore, serum levels of miRNA-5100 in patients with AKI were identified as significantly lower than those of healthy subjects. ROC analysis showed that the serum expression level of miRNA-5100 can identify AKI (cut-off value 0.14, AUC 0.96, sensitivity 1.00, specificity 0.833, p&amp;lt;0.05). These results suggest that miRNA-5100 regulates AKI and may be useful as a novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Promoted NIR-II Fluorescence by Heteroatom-Inserted Rigid-Planar Cores for Monitoring Cell Therapy of Acute Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorophores with emission in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window have displayed salient advantages for biomedical applications. However, exploration of new luminogens with high NIR-II fluorescent brightness is still challenging. Herein, based on the &amp;ldquo;ring-fusion&amp;rdquo; strategy, a series of heteroatom-inserted rigid-planar cores is proposed to achieve the bathochromic NIR-II fluorophores with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) performance. Interestingly, one of the representative fluorophores, 4,4&amp;rsquo;-(5,5&amp;rsquo;-([1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-i]dithieno[2,3-a:3&amp;rsquo;,2&amp;rsquo;-c]phenazine-8,12-diyl)bis(4-octylthiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(N,N-diphenylaniline) (TTQiT), enjoys a maximum emission beyond 1100 nm because of the efficiently narrowed energy bandgap by electron-rich sulfur-atom-inserted core, which is verified by theoretical calculation. Taking advantage of the bright NIR-II emission of TTQiT nanoparticles, the desirable in vivo NIR-II imaging with high signal-to-background ratios is successfully performed and a long-term stem cell tracking in the detection of acute lung injury is further realized. Therefore, it is anticipated that this work will provide a promising molecular engineering strategy to enrich the scope of NIR-II fluorophores for catering to diverse demands in biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tubule-specific deletion of LincRNA-p21 ameliorates lipotoxic kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34853727/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipotoxicity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-related kidney damage and propagates chronic kidney injury like diabetic kidney disease; however, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. To date, reduction of lipid acquisition and enhancement of lipid metabolism are the major, albeit non-specific, approaches to improve lipotoxic kidney damage. In the kidneys of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and tubule cells cultured with palmitic acid (PA), we observed a dramatic upregulation of the long intergenic non-coding RNA-p21 (&lt;em&gt;LincRNA-p21&lt;/em&gt;) through a p53-dependent mechanism. Kidney tubule cell-specific deletion of &lt;em&gt;LincRNA-p21&lt;/em&gt; attenuated oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, leading to reduction of histological and functional kidney injury despite persistent obesity and hyperlipidemia. Mechanistically, HFD- or PA-initiated lipotoxicity suppressed the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)/murine double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) signaling cascade to activate p53 and enhance the transcriptional activity of &lt;em&gt;LincRNA-p21&lt;/em&gt;. Collectively, our findings suggest that the p53/&lt;em&gt;LincRNA-p21&lt;/em&gt; axis is the downstream effector in lipotoxic kidney injury and that targeting this axis particularly in the kidney tubule could be a novel therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fe-Curcumin Nanozyme-Mediated Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging and Anti-Inflammation for Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35106369/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumonia, such as acute lung injury (ALI), has been a type of lethal disease that is generally caused by uncontrolled inflammatory response and excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, we report Fe-curcumin-based nanoparticles (Fe-Cur NPs) with nanozyme functionalities in guiding the intracellular ROS scavenging and meanwhile exhibiting anti-inflammation efficacy for curing ALI. The nanoparticles are noncytotoxic when directing these biological activities. Mechanism studies for the anti-inflammation aspects of Fe-Cur NPs were systematically carried out, in which the infected cells and tissues were alleviated through downregulating levels of several important inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), decreasing the intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasomes, and suppressing NF-κB signaling pathways. In addition, we performed both the intratracheal and intravenous injection of Fe-Cur NPs in mice experiencing ALI and, importantly, found that the accumulation of such nanozymes was enhanced in lung tissue (better than free curcumin drugs), demonstrating its promising therapeutic efficiency in two different administration methods. We showed that the inflammation reduction of Fe-Cur NPs was effective in animal experiments and that ROS scavenging was also effectively achieved in lung tissue. Finally, we revealed that Fe-Cur NPs can decrease the level of macrophage cells (CD11b&lt;sup&gt;lo&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;) and CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in mice, which could help suppress the inflammation cytokine storm caused by ALI. Overall, this work has developed the strategy of using Fe-Cur NPs as nanozymes to scavenge intracellular ROS and as an anti-inflammation nanodrugs to synergistically cure ALI, which may serve as a promising therapeutic agent in the clinical treatment of this deadly disease. Fe-Cur NP nanozymes were designed to attenuate ALI by clearing intracellular ROS and alleviating inflammation synergistically. Relevant cytokines, inflammasomes, and signaling pathways were studied.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crossed Pathways for Radiation-Induced and Immunotherapy-Related Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34925345/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a form of radiation damage to normal lung tissue caused by radiotherapy (RT) for thoracic cancers, which is most commonly comprised of radiation pneumonitis (RP) and radiation pulmonary fibrosis (RPF). Moreover, with the widespread utilization of immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors as first- and second-line treatments for various cancers, the incidence of immunotherapy-related lung injury (IRLI), a severe immune-related adverse event (irAE), has rapidly increased. To date, we know relatively little about the underlying mechanisms and signaling pathways of these complications. A better understanding of the signaling pathways may facilitate the prevention of lung injury and exploration of potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, this review provides an overview of the signaling pathways of RILI and IRLI and focuses on their crosstalk in diverse signaling pathways as well as on possible mechanisms of adverse events resulting from combined radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Furthermore, this review proposes potential therapeutic targets and avenues of further research based on signaling pathways. Many new studies on pyroptosis have renewed appreciation for the value and importance of pyroptosis in lung injury. Therefore, the authors posit that pyroptosis may be the common downstream pathway of RILI and IRLI; discussion is also conducted regarding further perspectives on pyroptosis as a crucial signaling pathway in lung injury treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time Series Transcriptomic Analysis of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Cells from Piglets Infected with Virulent or Low-Virulent Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus 1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34851149/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has evolved to escape the immune surveillance for a survival advantage leading to a strong modulation of host&amp;rsquo;s immune responses and favoring secondary bacterial infections. However, limited data are available on how the immunological and transcriptional responses elicited by virulent and low-virulent PRRSV-1 strains are comparable and how they are conserved during the infection. To explore the kinetic transcriptional signature associated with the modulation of host immune response at lung level, a time-series transcriptomic analysis was performed in bronchoalveolar lavage cells upon experimental in vivo infection with two PRRSV-1 strains of different virulence, virulent subtype 3 Lena strain or the low-virulent subtype 1 3249 strain. The time-series analysis revealed overlapping patterns of dysregulated genes enriched in T-cell signaling pathways among both virulent and low-virulent strains, highlighting an upregulation of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory immune checkpoints that were disclosed as Hub genes. On the other hand, virulent Lena infection induced an early and more marked &amp;ldquo;negative regulation of immune system process&amp;rdquo; with an overexpression of co-inhibitory receptors genes related to T-cell and NK cell functions, in association with more severe lung lesion, lung viral load, and BAL cell kinetics. These results underline a complex network of molecular mechanisms governing PRRSV-1 immunopathogenesis at lung level, revealing a pivotal role of co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoints in the pulmonary disease, which may have an impact on T-cell activation and related pathways. These immune checkpoints, together with the regulation of cytokine-signaling pathways, modulated in a virulence-dependent fashion, orchestrate an interplay among pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the major threats to swine health and global production, causing substantial economic losses. We explore the mechanisms involved in the modulation of host immune response at lung level performing a time-series transcriptomic analysis upon experimental infection with two PRRSV-1 strains of different virulence. A complex network of molecular mechanisms was revealed to control the immunopathogenesis of PRRSV-1 infection, highlighting an interplay among pro- and anti-inflammatory responses as a potential mechanism to restrict inflammation-induced lung injury. Moreover, a pivotal role of co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoints was evidenced, which may lead to progressive dysfunction of T cells, impairing viral clearance and leading to persistent infection, favoring as well secondary bacterial infections or viral rebound. However, further studies should be conducted to evaluate the functional role of immune checkpoints in advanced stages of PRRSV infection and explore a possible T-cell exhaustion state.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Bright, Renal-Clearable NIR-II Brush Macromolecular Probe with Long Blood Circulation Time for Kidney Disease Bioimaging</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34850517/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early detection of kidney disease is of vital importance due to its current prevalence worldwide. Fluorescence imaging, especially in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) has been regarded as a promising technique for the early diagnosis of kidney disease due to the superior resolution and sensitivity. However, the reported NIR-II organic renal-clearable probes are hampered by their low brightness (ϵmax Φf&amp;gt;1000 nm &amp;lt;10 M-1 cm-1 ) and limited blood circulation time (t1/2 &amp;lt;2 h), which impede the targeted imaging performance. Herein, we develop the aza-boron-dipyrromethene (aza-BODIPY) brush macromolecular probes (Fudan BDIPY Probes (FBP 912)) with high brightness (ϵmax Φf&amp;gt;1000 nm ≈60 M-1 cm-1 ), which is about 10-fold higher than that of previously reported NIR-II renal-clearable organic probes. FBP 912 exhibits an average diameter of ≈4 nm and high renal clearance efficiency (≈65 % excretion through the kidney within 12 h), showing superior performance for non-invasively diagnosis of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (RIR) earlier than clinical serum-based protocols. Additionally, the high molecular weight polymer brush enables FBP 912 with prolonged circulation time (t1/2 ≈6.1 h) and higher brightness than traditional PEGylated renal-clearable control fluorophores (t1/2 &amp;lt;2 h), facilitating for 4T1 tumor passive targeted imaging and renal cell carcinoma active targeted imaging with higher signal-to-noise ratio and extended retention time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meteorin-β/Meteorin like/IL-41 attenuates airway inflammation in house dust mite-induced allergic asthma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34848868/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sought to examine the regulatory effect of Meteorin-β (Metrnβ)/Meteorin like (Metrnl)/IL-41 on lung inflammation in allergic asthma. We found that Metrnβ was elevated significantly in asthmatic patients and in mice with allergic asthma induced by house dust mite (HDM) extract. Upon exposure to HDM, Metrnβ was secreted predominantly by airway epithelial cells and inflammatory cells, including macrophages and eosinophils. The increased Metrnβ effectively blocked the development of airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and decreased inflammatory cell airway infiltration and type 2 cytokine production, which was associated with downregulated DC-mediated adaptive immune responses. Moreover, Metrnβ impaired the maturation and function of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells in vitro. Asthmatic mice adoptively transferred with dendritic cells isolated from Metrnβ-treated allergic mice displayed decreased AHR, airway inflammation, and lung injury. Metrnβ also displayed anti-inflammatory properties in immunodeficient SCID mice with allergic asthma and in in vitro 3D ALI airway models. Moreover, blockade of Metrnβ by anti-Metrnβ antibody treatment promoted the development of allergic asthma. These results revealed the unappreciated protective roles of Metrnβ in alleviating DC-mediated Th2 inflammation in allergic asthma, providing the novel treatment strategy of therapeutic targeting of Metrnβ in allergic asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pirfenidone increases IL-10 and improves acute pancreatitis in multiple clinically relevant murine models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of research, there is no specific therapy for acute pancreatitis (AP). In the current study, we have evaluated the efficacy of pirfenidone, an antiinflammatory and antifibrotic agent that is approved by the FDA for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), in ameliorating local and systemic injury in AP. Our results suggest that treatment with pirfenidone in therapeutic settings (e.g., after initiation of injury), even when administered at the peak of injury, reduces severity of local and systemic injury and inflammation in multiple models of AP. In vitro evaluation suggests that pirfenidone decreases cytokine release from acini and macrophages and disrupts acinar-macrophage crosstalk. Therapeutic pirfenidone treatment increases IL-10 secretion from macrophages preceding changes in histology and modulates the immune phenotype of inflammatory cells with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Antibody-mediated IL-10 depletion, use of IL-10-KO mice, and macrophage depletion experiments confirmed the role of IL-10 and macrophages in its mechanism of action, as pirfenidone was unable to reduce severity of AP in these scenarios. Since pirfenidone is FDA approved for IPF, a trial evaluating the efficacy of pirfenidone in patients with moderate to severe AP can be initiated expeditiously.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcripts associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction in transbronchial biopsies of lung transplants</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34850543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transplanted lungs suffer worse outcomes than other organ transplants with many developing chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), diagnosed by physiologic changes. Histology of transbronchial biopsies (TBB) yields little insight, and the molecular basis of CLAD is not defined. We hypothesized that gene expression in TBBs would reveal the nature of CLAD and distinguish CLAD from changes due simply to time posttransplant. Whole-genome mRNA profiling was performed with microarrays in 498 prospectively collected TBBs from the INTERLUNG study, 90 diagnosed as CLAD. Time was associated with increased expression of inflammation genes, for example, CD1E and immunoglobulins. After correcting for time, CLAD manifested not as inflammation but as parenchymal response-to-wounding, with increased expression of genes such as HIF1A, SERPINE2, and IGF1 that are increased in many injury and disease states and cancers, associated with development, angiogenesis, and epithelial response-to-wounding in pathway analysis. Fibrillar collagen genes were increased in CLAD, indicating matrix changes, and normal transcripts were decreased-dedifferentiation. Gene-based classifiers predicted CLAD with AUC 0.70 (no time-correction) and 0.87 (time-corrected). CLAD related gene sets and classifiers were strongly prognostic for graft failure and correlated with CLAD stage. Thus, in TBBs, molecular changes indicate that CLAD primarily reflects severe parenchymal injury-induced changes and dedifferentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation protects from Shiga toxin-mediated cell injury and lethality in host</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shiga toxins (Stxs) produced by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are the major virulence factors responsible for hemorrhagic colitis, which can lead to life-threatening systemic complications including acute renal failure (hemolytic uremic syndrome) and neuropathy. Here, we report that O-GlcNAcylation, a type of post-translational modification, was acutely increased upon induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in host cells by Stxs. Suppression of the abnormal Stx-mediated increase in O-GlcNAcylation effectively inhibited apoptotic and inflammatory responses in Stx-susceptible cells. The protective effect of O-GlcNAc inhibition for Stx-mediated pathogenic responses was also verified using three-dimensional (3D)-cultured spheroids or organoids mimicking the human kidney. Treatment with an O-GlcNAcylation inhibitor remarkably improved the major disease symptoms and survival rate for mice intraperitoneally injected with a lethal dose of Stx. In conclusion, this study elucidates O-GlcNAcylation-dependent pathogenic mechanisms of Stxs and demonstrates that inhibition of aberrant O-GlcNAcylation is a potential approach to treat Stx-mediated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Calycosin attenuates severe acute pancreatitis-associated acute lung injury by curtailing high mobility group box 1 - induced inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34908806/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common and life-threatening complication of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). There are currently limited effective treatment options for SAP and associated ALI. Calycosin (Cal), a bioactive constituent extracted from the medicinal herb Radix Astragali exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties, but its effect on SAP and associated ALI has yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim:&lt;/em&gt; To identify the roles of Cal in SAP-ALI and the underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: SAP was induced via two intraperitoneal injections of L-arg (4 g/kg) and Cal (25 or 50 mg/kg) were injected 1 h prior to the first L-arg challenge. Mice were sacrificed 72 h after the induction of SAP and associated ALI was examined histologically and biochemically. An in vitro model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI was established using A549 cells. Immunofluorescence analysis and western blot were evaluated in cells. Molecular docking analyses were conducted to examine the interaction of Cal with HMGB1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Cal treatment substantially reduced the serum amylase levels and alleviated histopathological injury associated with SAP and ALI. Neutrophil infiltration and lung tissue levels of neutrophil mediator myeloperoxidase were reduced in line with protective effects of Cal against ALI in SAP. Cal treatment also attenuated the serum levels and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, IL-1β, HMGB1 and chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 1 in lung tissue. Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses showed that Cal treatment markedly suppressed the expression of HMGB1 and phosphorylated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 in lung tissues and an in vitro model of LPS-induced ALI in A549 cells suggesting a role for HGMB1 in the pathogenesis of ALI. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis provided evidence for the direct interaction of Cal with HGMB1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Cal protects mice against L-arg-induced SAP and associated ALI by attenuating local and systemic neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory response via inhibition of HGMB1 and the NF-κB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cartilaginous Extracellular Matrix Enriched with Human Gingival Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived &#39;Matrix Bound Extracellular Vesicles&#39; Enabled Functional Reconstruction of Tracheal Defect</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem cells derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) conceive cues essential for tissue repair. Mammalian cartilaginous extracellular matrix (cECM) may not be optimally inductive for tracheal regeneration because of the granulomatous, instead of regenerative, responses in injured adult mammalian tracheas. Given the high regenerative capacity of gingiva, it is hypothesized human gingival mesenchymal stem cells derived EVs (gEVs) can induce mammalian tracheal epithelia regeneration. Coculturing chondrocytes with GMSCs produce abundant &amp;ldquo;matrix bound gEVs (gMVs)&amp;rdquo; in forming cartilaginous ECM, which are further preserved in acellular cECM (cACM) following mild, short-period decellularization. The results show that gMVs-cACM could be well anchored on polyglycerol sebacate microporous patch thus enforce the surgical suturability and mechanical strength. In rabbit tracheal defect, the gMVs-cACM patch induces rapid regeneration of vascularized ciliated columnar epithelium, which supports long-term survival of animals. gMVs-cACM treated groups exhibit proliferation of tracheal progenitors-basal epithelial cells, as well as, activation of JAK2/STAT1 pathway in reparative cells. This study departs from conventional focuses on tissue derived ECM and introduces a new approach for tracheal tissue regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) arises from mutations in the SERPINA1 gene encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) that lead to AAT retention in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, causing proteotoxic liver injury and loss-of-function lung disease. The homozygous Pi∗Z mutation (Pi∗ZZ genotype) is responsible for the majority of severe AATD cases and can precipitate both paediatric and adult liver diseases, while the heterozygous Pi∗Z mutation (Pi∗MZ genotype) is an established genetic modifier of liver disease. We review genotype-related hepatic phenotypes/disease predispositions. We also describe the mechanisms and factors promoting the development of liver disease, as well as approaches to evaluate the extent of liver fibrosis. Finally, we discuss emerging diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the clinical management of this often neglected disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kidney vascular congestion exacerbates acute kidney injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34843756/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart failure is frequently accompanied by kidney failure and co-incidence of these organ failures worsens the mortality in patients with heart failure. Recent clinical observations revealed that increased kidney venous pressure, rather than decreased cardiac output, causes the deterioration of kidney function in patients with heart failure. However, the underlying pathophysiology is unknown. Here, we found that decreased blood flow velocity in peritubular capillaries by kidney congestion and upregulation of endothelial nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling synergistically exacerbate kidney injury. We generated a novel mouse model with unilateral kidney congestion by constriction of the inferior vena cava between kidney veins. Intravital imaging highlighted the notable dilatation of peritubular capillaries and decreased kidney blood flow velocity in the congestive kidney. Damage after ischemia reperfusion injury was exacerbated in the congestive kidney and accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes within peritubular capillaries was noted at the acute phase after injury. Similar results were obtained in vitro, in which polymorphonuclear leukocytes adhesion on activated endothelial cells was decreased in flow velocity-dependent manner but cancelled by inhibition of NF-κB signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB for the mice subjected by both kidney congestion and ischemia reperfusion injury ameliorated the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and subsequent exacerbation of kidney injury. Thus, our study demonstrates the importance of decreased blood flow velocity accompanying activated NF-κB signaling in aggravation of kidney injury. Hence, inhibition of NF-κB signaling may be a therapeutic candidate for the vicious cycle between heart and kidney failure with increased kidney venous pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19-induced &amp;ldquo;acute respiratory distress syndrome&amp;rdquo; (ARDS) is associated with prolonged respiratory failure and high mortality, but the mechanistic basis of lung injury remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyze pulmonary immune responses and lung pathology in two cohorts of patients with COVID-19 ARDS using functional single-cell genomics, immunohistology, and electron microscopy. We describe an accumulation of CD163-expressing monocyte-derived macrophages that acquired a profibrotic transcriptional phenotype during COVID-19 ARDS. Gene set enrichment and computational data integration revealed a significant similarity between COVID-19-associated macrophages and profibrotic macrophage populations identified in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. COVID-19 ARDS was associated with clinical, radiographic, histopathological, and ultrastructural hallmarks of pulmonary fibrosis. Exposure of human monocytes to SARS-CoV-2, but not influenza A virus or viral RNA analogs, was sufficient to induce a similar profibrotic phenotype in vitro. In conclusion, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 triggers profibrotic macrophage responses and pronounced fibroproliferative ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ADAM17/MMP inhibition prevents neutrophilia and lung injury in a mouse model of COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34826347/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by lung injury, cytokine storm, and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Current therapies focus on reducing viral replication and inflammatory responses, but no specific treatment exists to prevent the development of severe COVID-19 in infected individuals. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, but it is also critical for maintaining the correct functionality of lung epithelium and endothelium. Coronaviruses induce activation of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) and shedding of ACE2 from the cell surface resulting in exacerbated inflammatory responses. Thus, we hypothesized that ADAM17 inhibition ameliorates COVID-19-related lung inflammation. We employed a preclinical mouse model using intratracheal instillation of a combination of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RBD-S) to mimic lung damage associated with COVID-19. Histologic analysis of inflamed mice confirmed the expected signs of lung injury including edema, fibrosis, vascular congestion, and leukocyte infiltration. Moreover, inflamed mice also showed an increased NLR as observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Administration of the ADAM17/MMP inhibitors apratastat and TMI-1 significantly improved lung histology and prevented leukocyte infiltration. Reduced leukocyte recruitment could be explained by reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines and lower levels of the endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Additionally, the NLR was significantly reduced by ADAM17/MMP inhibition. Thus, we propose inhibition of ADAM17/MMP as a novel promising treatment strategy in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to prevent the progression toward severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PACS-2 attenuates diabetic kidney disease via the enhancement of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane formation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The altered homeostasis of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM) was closely associated with the pathological process of nervous system diseases and insulin resistance. Here, the exact implication of phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (PCAS-2), an anchor protein in the MAM interface, in diabetic kidney disease was investigated. In the kidneys of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mice and HG-induced HK-2 cells, a notable disruption of ER-mitochondria interactions, accompanied by a decreased PACS-2 expression in all subcellular fractions. Furthermore, PACS-2 knockout mice with diabetes displayed accelerated development of proteinuria, deterioration of kidney function, and aggravated disruption of MAM area, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, renal apoptosis, and fibrosis. However, overexpression of PACS-2 effectively protected diabetic kidneys and HG-treated HK-2 cells from renal tubular impairments. Importantly, experimental uncoupling of ER-mitochondria contacts reversed the protective effects of PACS-2 restoration on HK-2 cells under HG conditions. In summary, our data indicate a pivotal role of PACS-2 in the development of diabetic renal tubular injury via the stabilization of MAM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; The association between combat-related traumatic injury (CRTI) and cardiovascular risk is uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the association between CRTI and both metabolic syndrome (MetS) and arterial stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; This was a prospective observational cohort study consisting of 579 male adult UK combat veterans (UK-Afghanistan War 2003-2014) with CRTI who were frequency-matched to 565 uninjured men by age, service, rank, regiment, deployment period and role-in-theatre. Measures included quantification of injury severity (New Injury Severity Score (NISS)), visceral fat area (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), arterial stiffness (heart rate-adjusted central augmentation index (cAIx) and pulse wave velocity (PWV)), fasting venous blood glucose, lipids and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Overall the participants were 34.1±5.4 years, with a mean (±SD) time from injury/deployment of 8.3±2.1 years. The prevalence of MetS (18.0% vs 11.8%; adjusted risk ratio 1.46, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.94, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and the mean cAIx (17.61%±8.79% vs 15.23%±8.19%, p&amp;lt;0.0001) were higher among the CRTI versus the uninjured group, respectively. Abdominal waist circumference, visceral fat area, triglycerides, estimated insulin resistance and hs-CRP levels were greater and physical activity and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol lower with CRTI. There were no significant between-group differences in blood glucose, blood pressure or PWV. CRTI, injury severity (↑NISS), age, socioeconomic status (SEC) and physical activity were independently associated with both MetS and cAIx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; CRTI is associated with an increased prevalence of MetS and arterial stiffness, which are also influenced by age, injury severity, physical activity and SEC. The longitudinal impact of CRTI on clinical cardiovascular events needs further examination.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interleukin-27 in liver xenotransplantation: A rational target to mitigate ischemia reperfusion injury and increase xenograft survival</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34861509/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/34861509/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xenotransplantation generates strong immunological barriers against which robust innate and adaptive immune responses develop in a context of inherent inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-27 expression is highest in human livers compared to other organs used in transplantation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-27 has counteracting anti-inflammatory features that are engaged in response to specific environmental cues by suppressing self-reactive TH17 cells, and induces type-1 regulatory (Tr1) and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The suppressive activity of IL-27 involves the metabolism of extracellular matrix ATP (eATP), under the concerted action of membrane-bound ectoenzymes ecto-apyrase (CD39) and 5′ ectonucleotidase (CD73), which in turn produces extracellular adenosine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting the CD39/adenosine axis and refining IL-27/IL-27R interactions might be favorable therapeutic options to attenuating IRI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transplantation of xenogeneic organs is an attractive solution to the existing organ shortage dilemma, thus, securing a clinically acceptable prolongation of xenograft survival is an important goal. In preclinical transplantation models, recipients of liver, kidney, heart, or lung xenotransplants demonstrate significant graft damages through the release of pro-inflammatory molecules, including the C-reactive protein, cytokines, and histone-DNA complexes that all foster graft rejection. Recent studies have demonstrated that mitigation of ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) greatly improves xenograft survival. Organ IRI develops primarily on a complex network of cytokines and chemokines responding to molecular cues from the graft milieu. Among these, interleukin 27 (IL-27) plays an immunomodulatory role in IRI onset due to graft environment-dependent pro- and anti- inflammatory activities. This review focuses on the impact of IL-27 on IRI of liver xenotransplants and provides insights on the function of IL-27 that could potentially guide genetic engineering strategies of donor pigs and/or conditioning of organs prior to transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>miR-221-5p-Mediated Downregulation of JNK2 Aggravates Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34899681/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis and acute lung injury (ALI) are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We previously reported that c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 2 (JNK2) promotes stress-induced mitophagy by targeting small mitochondrial alternative reading frame (smARF) for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, thereby preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and restraining inflammasome activation. Here we report that loss of JNK2 exacerbates lung inflammation and injury during sepsis and ALI in mice. JNK2 is downregulated in mice with endotoxic shock or ALI, concomitantly correlated inversely with disease severity. Small RNA sequencing revealed that miR-221-5p, which contains seed sequence matching to JNK2 mRNA 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated region (3&amp;rsquo;UTR), is upregulated in response to lipopolysaccharide, with dynamically inverse correlation with JNK2 mRNA levels. miR-221-5p targets the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR of JNK2 mRNA leading to its downregulation. Accordingly, miR-221-5p exacerbates lung inflammation and injury during sepsis in mice by targeting JNK2. Importantly, in patients with pneumonia in medical intensive care unit, JNK2 mRNA levels in alveolar macrophages flow sorted from non-bronchoscopic broncholaveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were inversely correlated strongly and significantly with the percentage of neutrophils, neutrophil and white blood cell counts in BAL fluid. Our data suggest that miR-221-5p targets JNK2 and thereby aggravates lung inflammation and injury during sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The nephrotoxic potential of polystyrene microplastics at realistic environmental concentrations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34862106/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34862106/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As microplastics (MPs) dispersed into the environment, people might be exposed to MPs. Most pollutants either pass through or concentrate in the kidney. Therefore, nephrotoxicity tests are needed to verify the toxic potential of MPs. Here we used human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells to determine the association between nephrotoxicity and round-shape polystyrene MPs (PSMPs) (3.54 ± 0.39 μm) under realistic environmental exposure concentrations. Results revealed that PSMPs can adhere to the cell membrane and get entirely engulfed by HEK293 cells. PSMPs can induce cytotoxicity by oxidative stress via inhibition of the antioxidant haem oxygenase-1. Depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and formation of autophagosomes confirmed that apoptosis and autophagy can be simultaneously induced by PSMPs. The inflammatory factor was only activated (33 cytokines) by noncytotoxic concentration of PSMPs (3 ng/mL); however, the cytotoxic concentration (300 ng/mL) of PSMPs induced autophagy, which might further reduce NLRP3 expression, thus contributing to dampening inflammation (35 cytokines) in HEK293 cells. PSMPs (300 ng/mL) can impair kidney barrier integrity and increase the probability of developing acute kidney injury through the depletion of the zonula occludens-2 proteins and α1-antitrypsin. Altogether, our results demonstrated that environmental exposure to PSMPs may lead to an increased risk of renal disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cortistatin regulates fibrosis and myofibroblast activation in experimental hepatotoxic- and cholestatic-induced liver injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34821378/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Liver fibrosis induced by chronic hepatic injury remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of susceptibility/prognosis factors and new therapeutic tools for treating hepatic fibrotic disorders are urgent medical needs. Cortistatin is a neuropeptide with potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activities in lung that binds to receptors that are expressed in liver fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells. We evaluated the capacity of cortistatin to regulate liver fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental approach:&lt;/em&gt; We experimentally induced liver fibrosis in mice by chronic CCl4 exposure and bile duct ligation and evaluated the histopathological signs and fibrotic markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key results:&lt;/em&gt; Hepatic expression of cortistatin inversely correlated with liver fibrosis grade in mice and humans with hepatic disorders. Cortistatin-deficient mice showed exacerbated signs of liver damage and fibrosis and increased mortality rates when challenged by hepatotoxic and cholestatic injury. Compared with wild-type mice, non-parenchymal liver cells isolated from cortistatin-deficient mice showed increased presence of cells with activated myofibroblast phenotypes and a differential genetic signature that is indicative of activated hepatic stellate cells and periportal fibroblasts and of myofibroblasts with active contractile apparatus. Cortistatin treatment reversed in vivo and in vitro these exaggerated fibrogenic phenotypes and protected from progression to severe liver fibrosis in response to hepatic injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion and implications:&lt;/em&gt; We identify cortistatin as an endogenous molecular brake on liver fibrosis and its deficiency as a potential poor-prognosis marker for chronic hepatic disorders that link with fibrosis. Cortistatin-based therapies emerge as attractive strategies for ameliorating severe hepatic fibrosis of various aetiologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protection of CAPE-pNO2 Against Chronic Myocardial Ischemia by the TGF-Β1/Galectin-3 Pathway In Vivo and In Vitro</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34817763/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is known that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and its derivatives could ameliorate acute myocardial injury, their effects on chronic myocardial ischemia (CMI) were not reported. This study aimed to investigate the potential effect of caffeic acid p-nitro phenethyl ester (CAPE-pNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a derivative of CAPE) on CMI and underlying mechanisms. SD rats were subjected to high-fat-cholesterol-diet (HFCD) and vitamin D3, and the H9c2 cells were treated with LPS to establish CMI model, followed by the respective treatment with saline, CAPE, or CAPE-pNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In vivo, CAPE-pNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could reduce serum lipid levels and improve impaired cardiac function and morphological changes. Data of related assays indicated that CAPE-pNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; downregulated the expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and galectin-3 (Gal-3). Besides, CAPE-pNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decreased collagen deposition, the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes, and some related downstream proteins of Gal-3 in the CMI rats. Interestingly, the effects of CAPE-pNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on TGF-β1, Gal-3, and other proteins expressed in the lung were consistent with that in the heart. In vitro, CAPE-pNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could attenuate the fibrosis, apoptosis, and inflammation by activating TGF-β1/Gal-3 pathway in LPS-induced H9c2 cell. However, CAPE-pNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated cardioprotection can be eliminated when treated with modified citrus pectin (MCP, an inhibitor of Gal-3). And in comparison, CAPE-pNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; presented stronger effects than CAPE. This study indicates that CAPE-pNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may ameliorate CMI by suppressing fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis via the TGF-β1/Gal-3 pathway in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD153/CD30 signaling promotes age-dependent tertiary lymphoid tissue expansion and kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34813503/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tertiary lymphoid tissues (TLTs) facilitate local T and B cell interactions in chronically inflamed organs. However, the cells and molecular pathways that govern TLT formation are poorly defined. Here, we identified TNF superfamily CD153/CD30 signaling between 2 unique age-dependent lymphocyte subpopulations, CD153+PD-1+CD4+ senescence-associated T (SAT) cells and CD30+T-bet+ age-associated B cells (ABCs), as a driver for TLT expansion. SAT cells, which produced ABC-inducing factors IL-21 and IFN-γ, and ABCs progressively accumulated within TLTs in aged kidneys after injury. Notably, in kidney injury models, CD153 or CD30 deficiency impaired functional SAT cell induction, which resulted in reduced ABC numbers and attenuated TLT formation with improved inflammation, fibrosis, and renal function. Attenuated TLT formation after transplantation of CD153-deficient bone marrow further supported the importance of CD153 in immune cells. Clonal analysis revealed that SAT cells and ABCs in the kidneys arose from both local differentiation and recruitment from the spleen. In the synovium of aged rheumatoid arthritis patients, T peripheral helper/T follicular helper cells and ABCs also expressed CD153 and CD30, respectively. Together, our data reveal a previously unappreciated function of CD153/CD30 signaling in TLT formation and propose targeting the CD153/CD30 signaling pathway as a therapeutic target for slowing kidney disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nano-Enabled Reposition of Proton Pump Inhibitors for TLR Inhibition: Toward A New Targeted Nanotherapy for Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34816630/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation in macrophages plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). While TLR inhibition is a promising strategy to control the overwhelming inflammation in ALI, there still lacks effective TLR inhibitors for clinical uses to date. A unique class of peptide-coated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) is previously discovered, which effectively inhibited TLR signaling and protected mice from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. To fast translate such a discovery into potential clinical applicable nanotherapeutics, herein an elegant strategy of &amp;ldquo;nano-enabled drug repurposing&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;nano-targeting&amp;rdquo; is introduced to empower the existing drugs for new uses. Combining transcriptome sequencing with Connectivity Map analysis, it is identified that the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) share similar mechanisms of action to the discovered GNP-based TLR inhibitor. It is confirmed that PPIs (including omeprazole) do inhibit endosomal TLR signaling and inflammatory responses in macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and exhibits anti-inflammatory activity in an LPS-induced ALI mouse model. The omeprazole is then formulated into a nanoform with liposomes to enhance its macrophage targeting ability and the therapeutic efficacy in vivo. This research provides a new translational strategy of nano-enabled drug repurposing to translate bioactive nanoparticles into clinically used drugs and targeted nano-therapeutics for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preferential siRNA delivery to injured kidneys for combination treatment of acute kidney injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a sudden loss of renal function and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Tumor suppressor p53 and chemokine receptor CXCR4 were both implicated in the AKI pathology. Here, we report on the development and evaluation of polymeric CXCR4 antagonist (PCX) siRNA carrier for selective delivery to injured kidneys in AKI. Our results show that PCX/siRNA nanoparticles (polyplexes) provide protection against cisplatin injury to tubule cells in vitro when both CXCR4 and p53 are inhibited. The polyplexes selectively accumulate and are retained in the injured kidneys in cisplatin and bilateral ischemia reperfusion injury models of AKI. Treating AKI with the combined CXCR4 inhibition and p53 gene silencing with the PCX/sip53 polyplexes improves kidney function and decreases renal damage. Overall, our results suggest that the PCX/sip53 polyplexes have a significant potential to enhance renal accumulation in AKI and deliver therapeutic siRNA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Real-Time Monitoring Renal Impairment Due to Drug-Induced AKI and Diabetes-Caused CKD Using an NAG-Activatable NIR-II Nanoprobe</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34813273/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-time in vivo optical imaging of kidney function is important for the diagnosis of renal diseases, such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the reported optical imaging agents still have limitations for identifying AKI or CKD in the early stage due to their low sensitivity, poor tissue penetration, and significant background interference. Herein, an N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG)-activatable second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescent nanoprobe (BOD-II-NAG-NP) is developed for monitoring the progression of drug-induced AKI and in vivo imaging of diabetes-caused CKD. NAG, as a biomarker of renal diseases, is able to specifically activate BOD-II-NAG-NP to release NIR-II fluorescence signals, enabling in vivo imaging of kidney dysfunctions in living mice. Importantly, such an active imaging mechanism allows BOD-II-NAG-NP to noninvasively detect the onset of drug-induced AKI at least 32 h earlier than the most existing assays, which indicates that BOD-II-NAG-NP has the potential to be an optical imaging agent for the early diagnosis of AKI. Moreover, NIR-II fluorescence produced by BOD-II-NAG-NP could deeply penetrate into the relatively thick layers of fat in diabetic nephropathy mice and provide in vivo imaging with high resolution, indicating that BOD-II-NAG-NP has clinical potential for precision diagnosis of CKD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 N Protein Induces Acute Kidney Injury via Smad3-Dependent G1 Cell Cycle Arrest Mechanism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that the selective overactivation of autophagy can cause cell death with unique morphological features distinct from apoptosis or necrosis. This unique type of autophagic cell death, termed “autosis,” occurs not only &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; but also in vivo in cerebral hypoxia–ischemia. Moreover, autosis is inhibited both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; by cardiac glycosides, which are Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase antagonists used in clinical medicine. Our findings contribute to the basic understanding of cell-death mechanisms and suggest strategies for protecting cells against stresses such as hypoxia–ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and can cause severe multiple organ injury and death. Kidney is one of major target organs of COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, mechanisms through which COVID-19 causes AKI remain largely unknown and treatment remains unspecific and ineffective. Here, the authors report that normal kidney-specifically overexpressing SARS-CoV-2 N develops AKI, which worsens in mice under ischemic condition. Mechanistically, it is uncovered that SARS-CoV-2 N-induced AKI is Smad3-dependent as SARS-CoV-2 N protein can interact with Smad3 and enhance TGF-β/Smad3 signaling to cause tubular epithelial cell death and AKI via the G1 cell cycle arrest mechanism. This is further confirmed in Smad3 knockout mice and cells in which deletion of Smad3 protects against SARS-CoV-2 N protein-induced cell death and AKI in vivo and in vitro. Most significantly, it is also found that targeting Smad3 with a Smad3 pharmacological inhibitor is able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 N-induced AKI. In conclusion, the authors identify that SARS-CoV-2 N protein is a key mediator for AKI and induces AKI via the Smad3-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest mechanism. Targeting Smad3 may represent as a novel therapy for COVID-19-asscoaited AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fundamentals of vaping-associated pulmonary injury leading to severe respiratory distress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34810278/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaping of flavored liquids has been touted as safe alternative to traditional cigarette smoking with decreased health risks. The popularity of vaping has dramatically increased over the last decade, particularly among teenagers who incorporate vaping into their daily life as a social activity. Despite widespread and increasing adoption of vaping among young adults, there is little information on long-term consequences of vaping and potential health risks. This study demonstrates vaping-induced pulmonary injury using commercial JUUL pens with flavored vape juice using an inhalation exposure murine model. Profound pathological changes to upper airway, lung tissue architecture, and cellular structure are evident within 9 wk of exposure. Marked histologic changes include increased parenchyma tissue density, cellular infiltrates proximal to airway passages, alveolar rarefaction, increased collagen deposition, and bronchial thickening with elastin fiber disruption. Transcriptional reprogramming includes significant changes to gene families coding for xenobiotic response, glycerolipid metabolic processes, and oxidative stress. Cardiac systemic output is moderately but significantly impaired with pulmonary side ventricular chamber enlargement. This vaping-induced pulmonary injury model demonstrates mechanistic underpinnings of vaping-related pathologic injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of endothelial cells in pulmonary fibrosis via SREBP2 activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34806652/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with limited treatment options. Despite endothelial cells (ECs) comprising 30% of the lung cellular composition, the role of EC dysfunction in pulmonary fibrosis (PF) remains unclear. We hypothesize that sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of PF via EC phenotypic modifications. Transcriptome data demonstrate that SREBP2 overexpression in ECs led to the induction of the TGF, Wnt, and cytoskeleton remodeling gene ontology pathways and the increased expression of mesenchymal genes, such as snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (snai1), α-smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and neural cadherin. Furthermore, SREBP2 directly bound to the promoter regions and transactivated these mesenchymal genes. This transcriptomic change was associated with an epigenetic and phenotypic switch in ECs, leading to increased proliferation, stress fiber formation, and ECM deposition. Mice with endothelial-specific transgenic overexpression of SREBP2 (EC-SREBP2[N]-Tg mice) that were administered bleomycin to induce PF demonstrated exacerbated vascular remodeling and increased mesenchymal transition in the lung. SREBP2 was also found to be markedly increased in lung specimens from patients with IPF. These results suggest that SREBP2, induced by lung injury, can exacerbate PF in rodent models and in human patients with IPF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Syringaresinol Resisted Sepsis-Induced Acute Lung Injury by Suppressing Pyroptosis Via the Oestrogen Receptor-β Signalling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34807349/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common lung disease characterized by severe acute inflammatory lung injury in patients with sepsis. Syringaresinol (SYR) has been reported to have anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects, but whether it could prevent pyroptosis to improve sepsis-induced ALI remains unclear. The purpose of this work was to examine the impact of SYR on sepsis-induced ALI and investigate the underlying mechanisms. The ALI model was induced by caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in C57BL/6 mice, structural damage in the lung tissues was determined using haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, and the levels of related inflammatory cytokines and macrophage polarization were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and flow cytometry, respectively. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the protein levels of TLR4, NF-κB and MAPKs was measured by western blotting. The results demonstrated that SYR pretreatment significantly reduced lung tissue histological damage, inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines and albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, thereby alleviating lung tissue injury. Meanwhile, septic mice treated with SYR displayed a higher survival rate and lower percentage of M1 macrophages in the BALF and spleen than septic mice. In addition, lung tissues from the CLP + SYR group exhibited downregulated protein expression of NLRP3, ASC, GSDMD caspase-1 p20 and TLR4, along with decreased phosphorylated levels of NF-κB, ERK, JNK and P38, indicating that SYR administration effectively prevented CLP-induced pyroptosis in the lung. SYR also suppressed LPS-induced pyroptosis in RAW 264.7 cells by inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which was abolished by an oestrogen receptor-β (ERβ) antagonist (PHTPP). In conclusion, SYR exerted protective effects on CLP-induced ALI via the oestrogen receptor-β signalling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Newly established LC-MS/MS method for measurement of plasma BH4 as a predictive biomarker for kidney injury in diabetes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34808334/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34808334/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the first time LC-MS/MS with our own established protocol was used on human samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was confirmed that BH4 is negatively associated with ACR in diabetic human subjects and both BH4 and CPI 2h are independent risk factors for ACR progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BH4 can be protective for early renal function decline suggesting its deficiency may induce damage on renal function other than ACR progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; The clinical research on BH4 is limited because of the difficulties on its measurement. In this study, we used our own established LC-MS/MS method to examine the plasma BH4 levels in diabetes to determine whether it could be used as a biomarker for the prediction of kidney injury in those patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Hospitalized diabetes patients in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan to Aug 2021 were recruited. To assess the association between plasma BH4 with ACR or eGFR in diabetes, a total of 142 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were enrolled. They were divided into three groups by albuminuria levels: normoalbuminuria (n = 68), microalbuminuria (n = 48), and macroalbuminuria (n = 26) according to ACR; or into two groups by eGFR: eGFR≥90 or eGFR&amp;lt;90 ml/min for correlation and logistic regression analysis. Plasma BH4 level was measured by LC-MS/MS along with other biochemical indices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Plasma BH4 concentrations were decreased as ACR progressed. BH4 (r = -0.55, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and 2h C-Peptide (CP-2h) (r = -0.248, P = 0.003) levels were negatively correlated with ACR. Moreover, multivariable logistic regression analysis showed BH4 concentrations (B = -0.468, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and CP-2h (B = -0.257, P = 0.028) were independently associated with ACR progression. ROC curve showed that BH4 level has a predictive value on ACR (95%CI 0.686-0.841, sensitivity 69.1%, specificity 73%). Moreover, in diabetes patients with eGFR≥90 ml/min, plasma BH4 level (P = 0.008) is higher than those in diabetes with eGFR&amp;lt;90 ml/min and BH4 was remained independently associated with eGFR after multivariable logistic regression analysis (B = -0.193, P = 0.048).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our established LC-MS/MS method could be used on human plasma BH4 measurements and our data suggested that BH4 level can be used as a biomarker for kidney injury in diabetes indicated by its association with ACR progression and early renal function decline.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Pulmonary Vascular Model From Endothelialized Whole Organ Scaffolds</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34869270/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of an &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; system for the study of lung vascular disease is critical to understanding human pathologies. Conventional culture systems fail to fully recapitulate native microenvironmental conditions and are typically limited in their ability to represent human pathophysiology for the study of disease and drug mechanisms. Whole organ decellularization provides a means to developing a construct that recapitulates structural, mechanical, and biological features of a complete vascular structure. Here, we developed a culture protocol to improve endothelial cell coverage in whole lung scaffolds and used single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis to explore the impact of decellularized whole lung scaffolds on endothelial phenotypes and functions in a biomimetic bioreactor system. Intriguingly, we found that the phenotype and functional signals of primary pulmonary microvascular revert back-at least partially-toward native lung endothelium. Additionally, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelium cultured in decellularized lung systems start to gain various native human endothelial phenotypes. Vascular barrier function was partially restored, while small capillaries remained patent in endothelial cell-repopulated lungs. To evaluate the ability of the engineered endothelium to modulate permeability in response to exogenous stimuli, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was introduced into repopulated lungs to simulate acute lung injury. After LPS treatment, proinflammatory signals were significantly increased and the vascular barrier was impaired. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel platform that recapitulates some pulmonary microvascular functions and phenotypes at a whole organ level. This development may help pave the way for using the whole organ engineering approach to model vascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extracellular citrate serves as a DAMP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extracellular citrate aggravates the pathological lung injury induced by LPS in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extracellular citrate  triggers the priming of NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extracellular citrate plus ATP exacerbates the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrate has a prominent role as a substrate in cellular energy metabolism. Recently, citrate has been shown to drive inflammation. However, the role of citrate in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) remains unclear. Here, we aimed to clarify whether extracellular citrate aggravated the LPS-induced ALI and the potential mechanism. Our findings demonstrated that extracellular citrate aggravated the pathological lung injury induced by LPS in mice, characterized by up-regulation of pro-inflammatory factors and over-activation of NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in the lungs. In vitro, we found that citrate treatment significantly augmented the expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β and enhanced the translocation of NF-κB/p65 into the nucleus. Furthermore, extracellular citrate plus adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) significantly increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in primary murine macrophages. Inhibiting the production of ROS with a ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) attenuated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Altogether, we conclude that extracellular citrate may serve as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and aggravates LPS-induced ALI by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs) constitute an attractive alternative for asthma treatment. However, very little evidence is available from studies on the oral administration of CpG-ODNs in animals. Previously, we developed acid-resistant particles (named ODNcap) as an oral delivery device for ODNs. Here, we showed that free feeding of an ODNcap-containing feed prophylactically attenuates allergic airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and goblet cell hyperplasia in an ovalbumin-induced asthma model. Using transcriptomics-driven approaches, we demonstrated that injury of pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes accompanies allergen inhalation challenge, but is inhibited by ODNcap feeding. We also showed the participation of an airway antimicrobial peptide (Reg3γ) and fecal microbiota in the ODNcap-mediated effects. Collectively, our findings suggest that daily oral ingestion of ODNcap may provide preventive effects on allergic bronchopulmonary insults via regulation of mechanisms involved in the gut-lung connection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resveratrol alleviates acute lung injury through regulating PLSCR-3-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy in a cecal ligation and puncture model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34808102/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is considered as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response of the host to an infection. Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition, and is the type of organ injury that is most commonly induced by sepsis. Resveratrol (RSV) has been shown to exert a wide range of therapeutic effects due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. The present study aimed to investigate whether RSV could mitigate sepsis-induced ALI/ARDS, and also to unravel the underlying mechanism. The model of sepsis was established by applying the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method, and mitochondria from the lung tissue were isolated to assess mitochondrial function, as determined from measuring mitochondrial superoxide production using MitoSOX red mitochondrial superoxide indicator and the membrane potential. It was found that RSV could exert a protective role in CLP-induced ALI/ARDS, as evidenced by moderate levels of inflammatory cell infiltration and interstitial edema, as well as decreased levels of C-reactive protein (P&amp;lt;0.01), interleukin (IL)-6 (P&amp;lt;0.01), IL-1β (P&amp;lt;0.01) and tumor necrosis factor-α (P&amp;lt;0.01). Moreover, phospholipid scramblase 3 (PLSCR-3)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy were shown to contribute towards the CLP-caused lung damage, which was reversed upon RSV administration, as demonstrated by improved mitochondrial function and markedly reduced increases in the protein levels of autophagy related (ATG)5 (P&amp;lt;0.01), ATG7 (P&amp;lt;0.05) and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-Ⅰ/Ⅱ) (P&amp;lt;0.01), and a significantly increased expression of P62 (P&amp;lt;0.05). In addition, with regard to the CLP-induced lung injury in the mouse model, overexpression of PLSCR-3 was found to remove the beneficial effects observed upon RSV treatment. Taken together, the results of the present study have uncovered a novel molecular mechanism through which RSV may alleviate ALI/ARDS via regulating PLSCR-3-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy in CLP-induced mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Xanthine Oxidoreductase Inhibitors Suppress the Onset of Exercise-Induced AKI in High HPRT Activity Urat1- Uox Double Knockout Mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Hereditary renal hypouricemia type 1 (RHUC1) is caused by URAT1/SLC22A12 dysfunction, resulting in urolithiasis and exercise-induced AKI (EIAKI). However, because there is no useful experimental RHUC1 animal model, the precise pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying EIAKI have yet to be elucidated. We established a high HPRT activity &lt;em&gt;Urat1-Uox&lt;/em&gt; double knockout (DKO) mouse as a novel RHUC1 animal model for investigating the cause of EIAKI and the potential therapeutic effect of xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitors (XOIs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The novel &lt;em&gt;Urat1-Uox&lt;/em&gt; DKO mice were used in a forced swimming test as loading exercise to explore the onset mechanism of EIAKI and evaluate related purine metabolism and renal injury parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Urat1-Uox&lt;/em&gt; DKO mice had uricosuric effects and elevated levels of plasma creatinine and BUN as renal injury markers, and decreased creatinine clearance observed in a forced swimming test. In addition, &lt;em&gt;Urat1-Uox&lt;/em&gt; DKO mice had increased NLRP3 inflammasome activity and downregulated levels of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase protein in the kidney, as Western blot analysis showed. Finally, we demonstrated that topiroxostat and allopurinol, XOIs, improved renal injury and functional parameters of EIAKI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Urat1-Uox&lt;/em&gt; DKO mice are a useful experimental animal model for human RHUC1. The pathogenic mechanism of EIAKI was found to be due to increased levels of IL-1β via NLRP3 inflammasome signaling and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase dysfunction associated with excessive urinary urate excretion. In addition, XOIs appear to be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of EIAKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cell stress response impairs de novo NAD&#43; biosynthesis in the kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34793337/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biosynthetic routes leading to de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) production are involved in acute kidney injury (AKI), with a critical role for quinolinate phosphoribosyl transferase (QPRT), a bottleneck enzyme of de novo NAD+ biosynthesis. The molecular mechanisms determining reduced QPRT in AKI, and the role of impaired NAD+ biosynthesis in the progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD), are unknown. We demonstrate that a high urinary quinolinate-to-tryptophan ratio, an indirect indicator of impaired QPRT activity and reduced de novo NAD+ biosynthesis in the kidney, is a clinically applicable early marker of AKI after cardiac surgery and is predictive of progression to CKD in kidney transplant recipients. We also provide evidence that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response may impair de novo NAD+ biosynthesis by repressing QPRT transcription. In conclusion, NAD+ biosynthesis impairment is an early event in AKI embedded with the ER stress response, and persistent reduction of QPRT expression is associated with AKI to CKD progression. This finding may lead to identification of noninvasive metabolic biomarkers of kidney injury with prognostic and therapeutic implications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CHRFAM7A expression in mice increases resiliency after injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34792616/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34792616/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; The CHRNA7 gene encodes the α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAchR) that regulates anti-inflammatory responses to injury; however, only humans express a variant gene called CHRFAM7A that alters the function of α7nAChR; CHRFAM7A expression predominates in bone marrow and monocytes/macrophages where the CHRFAM7A/CHRNA7 ratio is highly variable between individuals. We have previously shown in transgenic mice that CHRFAM7A increased emergency myelopoiesis from the bone marrow and monocyte/macrophage expression in lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; CHRFAM7A transgenic mice are compared to age- and gender-matched wild-type (WT) siblings. We utilized a model of sepsis using LPS injection to measure survival. Lung vascular permeability was measured after severe burn injury in WT vs. CHRFAM7A transgenic mice. Bone marrow CHRFAM7A expression was evaluated using adoptive transfer of CHRFAM7A transgenic bone marrow into WT mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Here, we demonstrate that CHRFAM7A expression results in an anti-inflammatory phenotype with an improved survival to LPS and decreased acute lung injury in a severe cutaneous burn model compared to WT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These data suggest that the relative expression of CHRFAM7A may alter resiliency to injury and contribute to individual variability in the human systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) to injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disease modeling of pulmonary fibrosis using human pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar organoids</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34798066/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human pluripotent stem cell-based in vitro pulmonary fibrosis model was established&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bleomycin-treated alveolar organoids showed epithelium-dependent contraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abnormal differentiation state and cellular senescence in AT2 cells were mimicked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inhibition of TGFβ signaling ameliorated the fibrogenic changes of the disease model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although alveolar epithelial cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, few practical in vitro models exist to study them. Here, we established a novel in vitro pulmonary fibrosis model using alveolar organoids consisting of human pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar epithelial cells and primary human lung fibroblasts. In this human model, bleomycin treatment induced phenotypes such as epithelial cell-mediated fibroblast activation, cellular senescence, and presence of alveolar epithelial cells in abnormal differentiation states. Chemical screening performed to target these abnormalities showed that inhibition of ALK5 or blocking of integrin αVβ6 ameliorated the fibrogenic changes in the alveolar organoids. Furthermore, organoid contraction and extracellular matrix accumulation in the model recapitulated the pathological changes observed in pulmonary fibrosis. This human model may therefore accelerate the development of highly effective therapeutic agents for otherwise incurable pulmonary fibrosis by targeting alveolar epithelial cells and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Abscisic acid inhibited reactive oxygen species-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress by regulating the PPAR-γ signaling pathway in ARDS mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34791723/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening form of a respiratory disorder, and there are few effective therapies. Abscisic acid (ABA) has been proven to be effective in influenza and asthma. Herein, we explored the protective effect of ABA on the resolution of ARDS and the underlying mechanism. Mice were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish an ARDS model. We found that ABA reduced pulmonary injury, with concomitant suppression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, after the elimination of ROS by the specific inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), ABA did not further inhibit airway inflammation or ER stress in ARDS mice. In addition, ABA inhibited ROS production through nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation in parallel with elevated levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ). Furthermore, the addition of a PPAR-γ antagonist abrogated the suppressive action of ABA on inflammation as well as on ER stress and oxidative stress, while NAC restored the protective effect of ABA in ARDS mice treated with a PPAR-γ antagonist. Collectively, ABA protects against LPS-induced lung injury through PPAR-γ signaling, and this effect may be associated with its inhibitory effect on ROS-mediated ER stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evaluation of microRNA expression in a sheep model for lung fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34789159/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibroproliferative disorder that has one of the poorest prognoses amongst interstitial lung diseases. Recently, the finding of aberrant expression levels of miRNAs in IPF patients has drawn significant attention to the involvement of these molecules in the pathogenesis of this disease. Clarification of the differential expression of miRNAs in health and disease may identify novel therapeutic strategies that can be employed in the future to combat IPF. This study evaluates the miRNA expression profiles in a sheep model for lung fibrosis and compares them to the miRNA profiles of both IPF patients and the mouse bleomycin model for pulmonary fibrosis. Pathway enrichment analyses were performed on differentially expressed miRNAs to illustrate which biological mechanisms were associated with lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We discovered 49 differentially expressed miRNAs in the sheep fibrosis model, in which 32 miRNAs were significantly down regulated, while 17 miRNAs were significantly upregulated due to bleomycin-induced lung injury. Moreover, the miRNA families miR-29, miR-26, miR-30, let-7, miR-21, miR-19, miR-17 and miR-199 were aberrantly expressed in both sheep and mouse models, with similar differential miRNAs expression observed in IPF cases. Importantly, 18 miRNAs were aberrantly expressed in both the sheep model and IPF patients, but not in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Together with pathway enrichment analyses, these results show that the sheep model can potentially be used to characterize previously unrecognized biological pathways associated with lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knockdown of circFOXO3 ameliorates cigarette smoke-induced lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34789242/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a prevalent chronic airway inflammatory disease. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are associated with inflammation regulation; therefore, we examined distinct effects of circRNA FOXO3 (circFOXO3) against pneumonic inflammatory processes in COPD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We first quantified and localized circFOXO3 in mouse lung epithelial cell line MLE12 by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and in situ hybridization. Next, circFOXO3 was suppressed by therapeutic administration of circFOXO3 knockdown lentivirus in mice exposed to air or cigarette smoke (CS) for 12 weeks, and several hallmarks of COPD were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We noticed that circFOXO3 is upregulated in CS-exposed lungs and cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-treated murine alveolar epithelial cells. Knockdown of circFOXO3 attenuated the release of CXCL1 and IL-6 as well as inflammatory processes in the lungs of CS-exposed mice. In addition, we identified miR-214-3p as a circFOXO3-targeted microRNA. MiR-214-3p overexpression exerted protective effects against pneumonic inflammation after CS exposure. Silencing of circFOXO3 downregulated IKK-β mRNA (miR-214-3p&amp;rsquo;s target), resulting in the dysfunction of the NF-κB signaling pathway and attenuation of CSE-induced inflammatory-cytokine expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, these findings reveal a crucial function of circFOXO3 in the pathological remodeling related to CS-induced inflammatory processes. Hence, circFOXO3 might be a good target for the treatment of inflammatory disorders similar to CS-induced lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent Progress of Ferroptosis in Lung Diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34869391/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a new form of programmed cell death due to iron-dependent excess accumulation of lipid peroxides and differs from other programmed cell deaths in morphological and biochemical characteristics. The process of ferroptosis is precisely regulated by iron metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and numerous signaling pathways, and plays a complex role in many pathophysiological processes. Recent studies have found that ferroptosis is closely associated with the development and progression of many lung diseases, including acute lung injury, pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we present a review of the main regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis and its research progress in the pathogenesis and treatment of lung diseases, with the aim of providing new ideas for basic and clinical research of lung-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A contemporary simple risk score for prediction of contrast-associated acute kidney injury after percutaneous coronary intervention: derivation and validation from an observational registry</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34793743/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Contrast-associated acute kidney injury can occur after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Prediction of the contrast-associated acute kidney injury risk is important for a tailored prevention and mitigation strategy. We sought to develop a simple risk score to estimate contrast-associated acute kidney injury risk based on a large contemporary PCI cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Consecutive patients undergoing PCI at a large tertiary care centre between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2020, with available creatinine measurements both before and within 48 h after the procedure, were included; only patients on chronic dialysis were excluded. Patients treated between 2012 and 2017 comprised the derivation cohort and those treated between 2018 and 2020 formed the validation cohort. The primary endpoint was contrast-associated acute kidney injury, defined according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network. Independent predictors of contrast-associated acute kidney injury were derived from multivariate logistic regression analysis. Model 1 included only pre-procedural variables, whereas Model 2 also included procedural variables. A weighted integer score based on the effect estimate of each independent variable was used to calculate the final risk score for each patient. The impact of contrast-associated acute kidney injury on 1-year deaths was also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Findings:&lt;/em&gt; 32 378 PCI procedures were performed and screened for inclusion in the present analysis. After the exclusion of patients without paired creatinine measurements, patients on chronic dialysis, and multiple procedures, 14 616 patients were included in the derivation cohort (mean age 66·2 years, 29·2% female) and 5606 were included in the validation cohort (mean age 67·0 years, 26·4% female). Contrast-associated acute kidney injury occurred in 860 (4·3%) patients. Independent predictors of contrast-associated acute kidney injury included in Model 1 were: clinical presentation, estimated glomerular filtration rate, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes, haemoglobin, basal glucose, congestive heart failure, and age. Additional independent predictors in Model 2 were: contrast volume, peri-procedural bleeding, no flow or slow flow post procedure, and complex PCI anatomy. The occurrence of contrast-associated acute kidney injury in the derivation cohort increased gradually from the lowest to the highest of the four risk score groups in both models (2·3% to 34·9% in Model 1, and 2·0% to 38·8% in Model 2). Inclusion of procedural variables in the model only slightly improved the discrimination of the risk score (C-statistic in the derivation cohort: 0·72 for Model 1 and 0·74 for model 2; in the validation cohort: 0·84 for Model 1 and 0·86 for Model 2). The risk of 1-year deaths significantly increased in patients with contrast-associated acute kidney injury (10·2% vs 2·5%; adjusted hazard ratio 1·76, 95% CI 1·31-2·36; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0·0002), which was mainly due to excess 30-day deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/em&gt; A contemporary simple risk score based on readily available variables from patients undergoing PCI can accurately discriminate the risk of contrast-associated acute kidney injury, the occurrence of which is strongly associated with subsequent death.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that the selective overactivation of autophagy can cause cell death with unique morphological features distinct from apoptosis or necrosis. This unique type of autophagic cell death, termed “autosis,” occurs not only &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; but also in vivo in cerebral hypoxia–ischemia. Moreover, autosis is inhibited both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; by cardiac glycosides, which are Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase antagonists used in clinical medicine. Our findings contribute to the basic understanding of cell-death mechanisms and suggest strategies for protecting cells against stresses such as hypoxia–ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by lung inflammation and pulmonary edema. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with ARDS in the more severe cases. This study aimed to compare the specificity of the metabolic alterations induced by COVID-19 or Influenza A pneumonia (IAP) in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Eighteen patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and twenty patients with ARDS due to IAP, admitted to the intensive care unit. ARDS was defined as in the American-European Consensus Conference. As compared with patients with COVID-19, patients with IAP were younger and received more often noradrenaline to maintain a mean arterial pressure &amp;gt; 65 mm Hg. Serum samples were analyzed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Multivariate Statistical Analyses were used to identify metabolic differences between groups. Metabolic pathway analysis was performed to identify the most relevant pathways involved in ARDS development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; ARDS due to COVID-19 or to IAP induces a different regulation of amino acids metabolism, lipid metabolism, glycolysis, and anaplerotic metabolism. COVID-19 causes a significant energy supply deficit that induces supplementary energy-generating pathways. In contrast, IAP patients suffer more marked inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. The classificatory model discriminated against the cause of pneumonia with a success rate of 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings support the concept that ARDS is associated with a characteristic metabolomic profile that may discriminate patients with ARDS of different etiologies, being a potential biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Treatment of Severe Acute Pancreatitis and Related Lung Injury by Targeting Gasdermin D-Mediated Pyroptosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional relevance and effects of the pyroptosis executioner gasdermin D (GSDMD) on severe acute pancreatitis (SAP)-associated lung injury are unclear. We established caerulein-induced mouse models of SAP-associated lung injury, which showed that GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was activated in both pancreatic and lung tissues. Compared with Gsdmd wild-type SAP mouse models, Gsdmd knockout (Gsdmd-/- ) ameliorated SAP-induced pancreas and related lung injury. Additionally, we investigated the effects of disulfiram on the treatment of SAP. Disulfiram is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-alcoholism drug, which is reported as an effective pyroptosis inhibitor by either directly covalently modifying GSDMD or indirectly inhibiting the cleavage of GSDMD via inactivating Nod-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome. We demonstrated that disulfiram inhibited the cleavage of GSDMD, alleviated caerulein-induced SAP and related lung injury, and decreased the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18). Collectively, these findings disclosed the role of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in SAP and the potential application of disulfiram in the treatment of SAP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A knock-in rat model unravels acute and chronic renal toxicity in glutaric aciduria type I</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34799272/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glutaric aciduria type I (GA-I, OMIM # 231670) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH). The principal clinical manifestation in GA-I patients is striatal injury most often triggered by catabolic stress. Early diagnosis by newborn screening programs improved survival and reduced striatal damage in GA-I patients. However, the clinical phenotype is still evolving in the aging patient population. Evaluation of long-term outcome in GA-I patients recently identified glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline with increasing age. We recently created the first knock-in rat model for GA-I harboring the mutation p.R411W (c.1231 C&amp;gt;T), corresponding to the most frequent GCDH human mutation p.R402W. In this study, we evaluated the effect of an acute metabolic stress in form of high lysine diet (HLD) on young &lt;em&gt;Gcdh&lt;sup&gt;ki/ki&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats. We further studied the chronic effect of GCDH deficiency on kidney function in a longitudinal study on a cohort of &lt;em&gt;Gcdh&lt;sup&gt;ki/ki&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats by repetitive 68Ga-EDTA positron emission tomography (PET) renography, biochemical and histological analyses. In young &lt;em&gt;Gcdh&lt;sup&gt;ki/ki&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats exposed to HLD, we observed a GFR decline and biochemical signs of a tubulopathy. Histological analyses revealed lipophilic vacuoles, thinning of apical brush border membranes and increased numbers of mitochondria in proximal tubular (PT) cells. HLD also altered OXPHOS activities and proteome in kidneys of &lt;em&gt;Gcdh&lt;sup&gt;ki/ki&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats. In the longitudinal cohort, we showed a progressive GFR decline in &lt;em&gt;Gcdh&lt;sup&gt;ki/ki&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats starting at young adult age and a decline of renal clearance. Histopathological analyses in aged &lt;em&gt;Gcdh&lt;sup&gt;ki/ki&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats revealed tubular dilatation, protein accumulation in PT cells and mononuclear infiltrations. These observations confirm that GA-I leads to acute and chronic renal damage. This raises questions on indication for follow-up on kidney function in GA-I patients and possible therapeutic interventions to avoid renal damage.

      <title>Impaired innate antiviral defenses in COVID-19: Causes, consequences and therapeutic opportunities</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34815163/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innate antiviral defenses are crucial for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COVID-19 clinical heterogeneity is associated with variability in innate immunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impairments in the interferon response account for COVID-19 severity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type I and type III interferons are promising therapeutics for COVID-19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emerged pathogen that has caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the worst pandemic of our times leading to tremendous loss of human life and unprecedented measures of social distancing. COVID-19 symptom manifestations range from asymptomatic disease to severe and lethal outcomes. Lack of previous exposure and immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and high infectivity of the virus have contributed to its broad spread across the globe. In the absence of specific adaptive immunity, innate immune mechanisms are crucial for efficient antiviral defenses and control of the infection. Accumulating evidence now suggests that the remarkable heterogeneity in COVID-19 disease manifestations is due to variable degrees of impairment of innate immune mechanisms. In this review, we summarize recent findings describing both viral and host intrinsic factors that have been linked to defective innate immune responses and account for severe COVID-19. We also discuss emerging therapeutic opportunities for targeting innate immunity for the treatment of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ethyl 2-Succinate-Anthraquinone Attenuates Inflammatory Response and Oxidative Stress via Regulating NLRP3 Signaling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34819853/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aloe-emodin widely possesses antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, and anti-infectious properties. This study investigated the effect of ethyl 2-succinate-anthraquinone (Luhui derivative, LHD) on inflammation. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, a THP-1 macrophage inflammation model, made by 100 ng/ml phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and 1 μg/ml LPS for 24 h, was constructed. The LHD group (6.25 μmol/L, 12.5 μmol/L, 25 μmol/L, 50 μmol/L) had no effect on THP-1 cell activity, and the expression of IL-6 mRNA was down-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner, of which the 25 μmol/L group had the best inhibitory effect. The migration of THP-1 macrophages induced by LPS was decreased by the LHD. Moreover, the LHD suppressed ROS fluorescence expression by inhibiting MDA expression and increasing SOD activity. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, we revealed that the LHD, in different doses (6.25 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg), has a protective effect on stress physiological responses by assessing the body temperature of mice. Interestingly, acute lung injury (e.g., the structure of the alveoli disappeared and capillaries in the alveolar wall were dilated and congested) and liver damage (e.g., hepatocyte swelling, neutrophil infiltration, and hepatocyte apoptosis) were obviously improved at the same condition. Furthermore, we initially confirmed that the LHD can down-regulate the expression of NLRP3, IL-1β, and caspase-1 proteins, thereby mediating the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway to produce anti-inflammatory effects. In conclusion, our results indicate that the LHD exerts anti-inflammatory activity via regulating the NLRP3 signaling pathway, inhibition of oxidative stress, and THP-1 macrophage migration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhaled curcumin mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles against radiation pneumonitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35646537/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation therapy is an effective method to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors using high-energy X-ray or γ-ray. Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is one of the most serious complications of radiation therapy for thoracic cancers, commonly leading to serious respiratory distress and poor prognosis. Here, we prepared curcumin-loaded mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (CMPN) for prevention and treatment of RP by pulmonary delivery. Mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (MPDA) were successfully synthesized with an emulsion-induced interface polymerization method and curcumin was loaded in MPDA via π‒π stacking and hydrogen bonding interaction. MPDA owned the uniform spherical morphology with numerous mesopores that disappeared after loading curcumin. More than 80% curcumin released from CMPN in 6 h and mesopores recovered. CMPN remarkably protected BEAS-2B cells from γ-ray radiation injury by inhibiting apoptosis. RP rat models were established after a single dose of 15 Gy &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co γ-ray radiation was performed on the chest area. Effective therapy of RP was achieved by intratracheal administration of CMPN due to free radical scavenging and anti-oxidation ability, and reduced proinflammatory cytokines, high superoxide dismutase, decreased malondialdehyde, and alleviated lung tissue damages were observed. Inhaled CMPN paves a new avenue for the treatment of RP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoenzyme-mediated catalytic activity is emerging as a novel strategy for reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging in acute lung injury (ALI) treatment. However, one of the main hurdles for these metal-containing nanoenzymes is their potential toxicity and single therapeutic mechanism. Herein, we uncovered a melanin-like nanoparticles derived from the self-polymerization of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (PDH nanoparticles), showing a significant anti-inflammation therapeutic effect on ALI mice. The prepared PDH nanoparticles rich in phenol groups could not only act as radical scavengers to alleviate oxidative stress but could also chelate calcium overload to suppress the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. As revealed by the therapeutic effect in vivo, PDH nanoparticles significantly prohibited neutrophil infiltration and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), thus improving the inflammatory cascade in the ALI model. Above all, our work provides an effective anti-inflammatory nanoplatform by using the inherent capability of melanin-like nanoenzymes, proposing the potential application prospects of these melanin-like nanoparticles for acute inflammation-induced injury treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytokine immunotherapy represents an attractive strategy to stimulate robust immune responses for renal injury repair in ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI). However, its clinical application is hindered by its nonspecificity to kidney, short circulation half-life, and severe side effects. An ideal cytokine immunotherapy for AKI requires preferential delivery of cytokines with accurate dosage to the kidney and sustained-release of cytokines to stimulate the immune responses. Herein, we developed a DNA nanoraft cytokine by precisely arranging interleukin-33 (IL-33) nanoarray on rectangle DNA origami, through which IL-33 can be preferentially delivered to the kidney for alleviation of AKI. A nanoraft carrying precisely quantified IL-33 predominantly accumulated in the kidney for up to 48 h. Long-term sustained-release of IL-33 from nanoraft induced rapid expansion of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC 2s) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and achieved better treatment efficiency compared to free IL-33 treatment. Thus, our study demonstrates that a nanoraft can serve as a structurally well-defined delivery platform for cytokine immunotherapy in ischemic AKI and other renal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Robust rank aggregation for gene list integration and meta-analysisBaicalin inhibits APEC-induced lung injury by regulating gut microbiota and SCFA production</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34821232/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baicalin is a plant-derived flavonoid from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi with multiple bioactivities and has a protective effect against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) infection. However, the underlying mechanism of baicalin against APEC infection is still unknown. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether the protective effects and mechanisms of baicalin on APEC-induced lung inflammation were related to the regulation of gut microbiota. The results showed that baicalin significantly reduced APEC colonization and pro-inflammatory cytokines production, and additionally recovered air-blood barrier integrity in the lungs after APEC challenge. However, depletion of gut microbiota significantly weakened the protective effects of baicalin against APEC infection as mentioned above. Furthermore, baicalin markedly restored the dysbiosis of gut microbiota induced by APEC as well as increased the abundance of short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and the production of SCFAs including acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid, especially acetic acid. In addition, the concentrations of acetic acid and its receptor free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) were significantly upregulated in the lung tissues after baicalin treatment. In conclusion, gut microbiota played a key role in the pharmacological action of baicalin against APEC-induced lung inflammation. Baicalin remodeled the dysbiosis of gut microbiota caused by APEC and increased the production of SCFAs, especially acetic acid in the gut, and then the increased acetate may circulate to the lungs to activate FFAR2 to defend APEC infection. Together, our study suggested that baicalin inhibited APEC infection through remodeling the gut microbiota dysbiosis and increasing the SCFA production. Furthermore, baicalin may serve as an alternative antibiotic and a novel therapeutic drug to prevent or treat APEC infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Asthma characterized by airway remodeling is a multiple pulmonary disease, which is associated with various physiological processes including inflammation reaction, immune response, oxidative stress and autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to investigate whether these processes are modulated by the total glucosides of Paeonia lactiflora Pall (TGP), and its active compound paeoniflorin (PF) with anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory effects could alleviate ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, models of mouse asthma were established by intraperitoneally with a mixture of OVA and aluminum hydroxide, plus a single nasal injected with OVA to female C57BL/6 mice. The results were observed with PET imaging, TEM, RT-PCR, western blotting. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells were isolated and detected with flow cytometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; TGP, either in its crude or processed form, and PF effectively ameliorated lung injury in mice induced by OVA, regulated immune/inflammatory response by inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby decreasing Th2 cell proportion, inhibited oxidative stress by recovering mitochondrial membrane potential and regulating metabolic activity in dose-dependent manner. Moreover, PF could inhibit autophagy by regulating mitochondrial function. In addition, the therapeutic effects of TGP and PF on pulmonary injury in asthmatic mice were not affected by processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; PF may be a valuable agent in ameliorating inflammation and immune response in asthmatic mice, and the possible mechanism involved in this response rang may from oxidative stress to autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oleic acid alleviates LPS-induced acute kidney injury by restraining inflammation and oxidative stress via the Ras/MAPKs/PPAR-γ signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34798521/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Rehmannia Glutinosa Libosch. is applied for the treatment of renal and inflammatory-related diseases, and oleic acid (OA) is a compound isolated from Rehmannia Glutinosa Libosch.. Unfortunately, the pharmacological activity of OA on LPS treated acute kidney injury (AKI) has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; The research is aiming to probe the activities of OA on LPS-induced AKI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Information of OA effect on AKI were from network pharmacology. H&amp;amp;E staining, creatinine (CRE) and urea nitrogen (UN) were performed to evaluate the activities of OA on kidney function. Inflammatory factors in serum were measured by cytometric bead array. Increased ratio of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in kidney and immune cells in the peripheral blood were determined by flow cytometry (FCM). PPAR-γ, MAPK and apoptotic signaling pathways were measured by Western blot. Then, a metabolomics approach was utilized to investigate OA&amp;rsquo;s response to AKI. The role of salirasib (FTS, Ras inhibitor) in OA acted on ROS, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, MMP and Ras signaling pathway in LPS treated NRK-52e cells were investigated by FCM and In-cell western.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; It is proved that OA effetively ameliorated renal function, alleviated inflammatory response and oxidative stress, and transformed apoptotic, MAPK and PPAR-γ signaling pathways in mice with AKI, regulated phenylalanine metabolism, purine metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, moreover, the role of OA in injury of NRK-52e was blocked by FTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In a word, OA could alleviate AKI by restraining inflammation and oxidative stress via regulating the Ras/MAPKs/PPAR-γ signaling pathway, phenylalanine metabolism, purine metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, which might be a useful strategy for treating AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bryodulcosigenin a natural cucurbitane-type triterpenoid attenuates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34798522/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Bryodulcosigenin (BDG) a cucurbitane-type triterpenoid has been isolated from the roots of Bryonia dioca and possesses marked anti-inflammatory effects, although its beneficial effect against intestinal disorders remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; To explore the underlying mechanism of BDG on the dysbiosis of chronic ulcerative colitis (UC) and its associated side-effects on lung tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A chronic UC model was established using 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice treated for 64 days and diagnostic assessments, western blot analysis and quantitative real time-PCR were employed to determine the protective mechanism of BDG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Oral administration of BDG (10 mg/kg/day) significantly improved colon length, disease activity index, and alleviated colonic histopathological damage in the DSS-induced colitis mice. BDG not only reversed the TNF-α-induced degradation of tight junction proteins (occludin and ZO-1) but also suppressed the elevated apoptosis seen in intestinal epithelial cells (NCM460). In addition, BDG significantly attenuated damage in alveolar epithelial cells (MLE-12) co-cultured with NCM460 cells under inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, BDG in vivo significantly prevented the symptoms of respiratory disorders and repressed alveolar inflammation by regulating DSS-induced chronic colitis in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; BDG effectively inhibited the apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and suppressed the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome which resulted in the restoration of the intestinal barrier. Therefore, the enhanced integrity of intestinal epithelial cells produced by BDG intervention contributed to its anti-colitis effects, indicating its great potential as an inhibitor of UC and lung injury. Therefore, restoring intestinal integrity may represent a promising strategy in the prevention of pulmonary disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interactions of chemical components in ambient PM2.5 with influenza viruses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34844361/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of this work is that ambient PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is a direct transmission mode for influenza virus infection to the human alveolar epithelium. The concentration of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; was 11.7 ± 5.5 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in Taipei during 24 December 2019-13 January 2020. Approximately 79% of inhaled PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is able to reach the upper-to-lower airway, and 47% of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is able to reach the alveolar epithelium for influenza virus infection. Influenza A and B viruses were detected in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; on 9 days, and the influenza A/H5 virus was detected on 15 days during the study period. FL and Pyr were negatively correlated with the influenza A virus. D(ah)P and Acp were positively correlated with the influenza B and A/H5 viruses, respectively. Cd, V, and Zn were positively correlated with the influenza A, B, and A/H5 viruses, respectively. Next, influenza A, B, and A/H5 viral plasmids interacted with carbon black, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, DEPs, and UD. We observed that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; significantly decreased levels of complementary DNA of the three influenza viruses. DEPs and UD significantly decreased influenza A and A/H5 viral levels. In conclusion, chemicals in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; may play vital roles in terms of viable influenza virus in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of clinical pulmonary edema and contributes to the development of acute lung injury (ALI). Here we reported that ruscogenin (RUS), an effective steroidal sapogenin of Radix Ophiopogon japonicus, attenuated lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced pulmonary endothelial barrier disruption through mediating non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMMHC IIA)‒Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) interactions. By in vivo and in vitro experiments, we observed that RUS administration significantly ameliorated LPS-triggered pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction and ALI. Moreover, we identified that RUS directly targeted NMMHC IIA on its N-terminal and head domain by serial affinity chromatography, molecular docking, biolayer interferometry, and microscale thermophoresis analyses. Downregulation of endothelial NMMHC IIA expression in vivo and in vitro abolished the protective effect of RUS. It was also observed that NMMHC IIA was dissociated from TLR4 and then activating TLR4 downstream Src/vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) signaling in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells after LPS treatment, which could be restored by RUS. Collectively, these findings provide pharmacological evidence showing that RUS attenuates LPS-induced pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction by inhibiting TLR4/Src/VE-cadherin pathway through targeting NMMHC IIA and mediating NMMHC IIA‒TLR4 interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Biosafety Level 2 Mouse Model for Studying Betacoronavirus-Induced Acute Lung Damage and Systemic Manifestations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34495692/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of life-threatening zoonotic diseases caused by betacoronaviruses, including the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, has highlighted the need for developing preclinical models mirroring respiratory and systemic pathophysiological manifestations seen in infected humans. Here, we showed that C57BL/6J wild-type mice intranasally inoculated with the murine betacoronavirus murine hepatitis coronavirus 3 (MHV-3) develop a robust inflammatory response leading to acute lung injuries, including alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and fibrin thrombi. Although such histopathological changes seemed to resolve as the infection advanced, they efficiently impaired respiratory function, as the infected mice displayed restricted lung distention and increased respiratory frequency and ventilation. Following respiratory manifestation, the MHV-3 infection became systemic, and a high virus burden could be detected in multiple organs along with morphological changes. The systemic manifestation of MHV-3 infection was also marked by a sharp drop in the number of circulating platelets and lymphocytes, besides the augmented concentration of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-12, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), thereby mirroring some clinical features observed in moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. Importantly, both respiratory and systemic changes triggered by MHV-3 infection were greatly prevented by blocking TNF signaling, either via genetic or pharmacologic approaches. In line with this, TNF blockage also diminished the infection-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines and virus replication of human epithelial lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Collectively, results show that MHV-3 respiratory infection leads to a large range of clinical manifestations in mice and may constitute an attractive, lower-cost, biosafety level 2 (BSL2) in vivo platform for evaluating the respiratory and multiorgan involvement of betacoronavirus infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouse models have long been used as valuable in vivo platforms to investigate the pathogenesis of viral infections and effective countermeasures. The natural resistance of mice to the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has launched a race toward the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection in other animals (e.g., hamsters, cats, ferrets, bats, and monkeys), as well as adaptation of the mouse model, by modifying either the host or the virus. In the present study, we utilized a natural pathogen of mice, MHV, as a prototype to model betacoronavirus-induced acute lung injure and multiorgan involvement under biosafety level 2 conditions. We showed that C57BL/6J mice intranasally inoculated with MHV-3 develops severe disease, which includes acute lung damage and respiratory distress that precede systemic inflammation and death. Accordingly, the proposed animal model may provide a useful tool for studies regarding betacoronavirus respiratory infection and related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are fundamental for intercellular communication and influence nearly every process in cell physiology. However, because of their intricate molecular complexity, quantitative knowledge on their signaling mechanisms is missing, particularly impeding their therapeutic application. We used a complementary and quantitative engineering approach based on sequential synthetic bottom-up assembly of fully functional EVs with precisely controlled lipid, protein, and RNA composition. We show that the functionalities of synthetic EVs are analogous to natural EVs and demonstrate their programmable therapeutic administration for wound healing and neovascularization therapy. We apply transcriptome profiling to systematically decode synergistic effects between individual EV constituents, enabling analytical dissection and a fundamental understanding of EV signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multifaceted roles of a bioengineered nanoreactor in repressing radiation-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34478930/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a potentially fatal and dose-limiting complication of thoracic cancer radiotherapy. However, effective therapeutic agents for this condition are limited. Here, we describe a novel strategy to exert additive effects of a non-erythropoietic EPO derivative (ARA290), along with a free radical scavenger, superoxide dismutase (SOD), using a bioengineered nanoreactor (SOD@ARA290-HBc). ARA290-chimeric nanoreactor makes SOD present in a confined reaction space by encapsulation into its interior to heighten stability against denaturing stimuli. In a RILI mouse model, intratracheal administration of SOD@ARA290-HBc was shown to significantly ameliorate acute radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. Our investigations revealed that SOD@ARA290-HBc performs its radioprotective effects by protecting against radiation induced alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis and ferroptosis, suppressing oxidative stress, inhibiting inflammation and by modulating the infiltrated macrophage phenotype, or through a combination of these mechanisms. In conclusion, SOD@ARA29-HBc is a potential therapeutic agent for RILI, and given its multifaceted roles, it may be further developed as a translational nanomedicine for other related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CCL1 expression positively correlates with the development of lung fibrosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CCL1 exerts its fibrogenic activity by signaling through AMFR on fibroblasts&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Suppression of the CCL1-AMFR-Ras-ERK-p70S6K axis reduces lung fibrosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruitment of immune cells to the site of inflammation by the chemokine CCL1 is important in the pathology of inflammatory diseases. Here, we examined the role of CCL1 in pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from PF mouse models contained high amounts of CCL1, as did lung biopsies from PF patients. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed that alveolar macrophages and CD4+ T cells were major producers of CCL1 and targeted deletion of Ccl1 in these cells blunted pathology. Deletion of the CCL1 receptor Ccr8 in fibroblasts limited migration, but not activation, in response to CCL1. Mass spectrometry analyses of CCL1 complexes identified AMFR as a CCL1 receptor, and deletion of Amfr impaired fibroblast activation. Mechanistically, CCL1 binding triggered ubiquitination of the ERK inhibitor Spry1 by AMFR, thus activating Ras-mediated profibrotic protein synthesis. Antibody blockade of CCL1 ameliorated PF pathology, supporting the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway for treating fibroproliferative lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-1β augments TGF-β inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition of epithelial cells and associates with poor pulmonary function improvement in neutrophilic asthmatics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34344357/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophilic asthmatics (NA) have less response to inhaled corticosteroids. We aimed to find out the predictor of treatment response in NA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthmatics (n = 115) and healthy controls (n = 28) underwent clinical assessment during 6-month follow-up with standardized therapy. Asthmatics were categorized by sputum differential cell count. The mRNA expressions were measured by RT-qPCR for sputum cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-27, FOXP3, IL-17A, and IL-5). The protein of IL-1β in sputum supernatant was detected by ELISA. Reticular basement membranes (RBM) were measured in the biopsy samples. The role and signaling pathways of IL-1β mediating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process were explored through A549 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NA had increased baseline sputum cell IL-1β expression compared to eosinophilic asthmatics (EA). After follow-up, NA had less improvement in FEV1 compared to EA. For all asthmatics, sputum IL-1β mRNA was positively correlated with protein expression. Sputum IL-1β mRNA and protein levels were negatively correlated to FEV1 improvement. After subgrouping, the correlation between IL-1β mRNA and FEV1 improvement was significant in NA but not in EA. Thickness of RBM in asthmatics was greater than that of healthy controls and positively correlated with neutrophil percentage in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In vitro experiments, the process of IL-1β augmenting TGF-β1-induced EMT cannot be abrogated by glucocorticoid or montelukast sodium, but can be reversed by MAPK inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IL-1β level in baseline sputum predicts the poor lung function improvement in NA. The potential mechanism may be related to IL-1β augmenting TGF-β1-induced steroid-resistant EMT through MAPK signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammatory responses induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with severe symptoms of COVID-19. Inflammasomes activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are also associated with COVID-19 severity. Here, we show a distinct mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation to induce hyperinflammation. N protein facilitates maturation of proinflammatory cytokines and induces proinflammatory responses in cultured cells and mice. Mechanistically, N protein interacts directly with NLRP3 protein, promotes the binding of NLRP3 with ASC, and facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. More importantly, N protein aggravates lung injury, accelerates death in sepsis and acute inflammation mouse models, and promotes IL-1β and IL-6 activation in mice. Notably, N-induced lung injury and cytokine production are blocked by MCC950 (a specific inhibitor of NLRP3) and Ac-YVAD-cmk (an inhibitor of caspase-1). Therefore, this study reveals a distinct mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and induces excessive inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enterically derived high-density lipoprotein restrains liver injury through the portal vein</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) requires apoA1 and the cholesterol transporter ABCA1. Although the liver generates most of the HDL in the blood, HDL synthesis also occurs in the small intestine. Here, we show that intestine-derived HDL traverses the portal vein in the HDL3 subspecies form, in complex with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP). HDL3, but not HDL2 or low-density lipoprotein, prevented LPS binding to and inflammatory activation of liver macrophages and instead supported extracellular inactivation of LPS. In mouse models involving surgical, dietary, or alcoholic intestinal insult, loss of intestine-derived HDL worsened liver injury, whereas outcomes were improved by therapeutics that elevated and depended upon raising intestinal HDL. Thus, protection of the liver from injury in response to gut-derived LPS is a major function of intestinally synthesized HDL.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The cell cycle inhibitor P21 promotes the development of pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing lung alveolar regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35256943/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cell cycle inhibitor P21 has been implicated in cell senescence and plays an important role in the injury-repair process following lung injury. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a fibrotic lung disorder characterized by cell senescence in lung alveolar epithelial cells. In this study, we report that P21 expression was increased in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2s) in a time-dependent manner following multiple bleomycin-induced PF. Repeated injury of AEC2s resulted in telomere shortening and triggered P21-dependent cell senescence. AEC2s with elevated expression of P21 lost their self-renewal and differentiation abilities. In particular, elevated P21 not only induced cell cycle arrest in AEC2s but also bound to P300 and β-catenin and inhibited AEC2 differentiation by disturbing the P300-β-catenin interaction. Meanwhile, senescent AEC2s triggered myofibroblast activation by releasing profibrotic cytokines. Knockdown of &lt;em&gt;P21&lt;/em&gt; restored AEC2-mediated lung alveolar regeneration in mice with chronic PF. The results of our study reveal a mechanism of P21-mediated lung regeneration failure during PF development, which suggests a potential strategy for the treatment of fibrotic lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;L. casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt; improves renal function and pathology in mouse models of AKI and CKD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;L. casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt; ameliorates gut microbial dysbiosis in both AKI and CKD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;L. casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt; reduces renal inflammation and damage via SCFAs and nicotinamide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;L. casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt; slows the decline of kidney function in individuals with stage 3–5 CKD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between gut microbial dysbiosis and acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD) is still unclear. Here, we show that oral administration of the probiotic &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;L. casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt;) corrected bilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced gut microbial dysbiosis, alleviated kidney injury, and delayed its progression to CKD in mice. &lt;em&gt;L. casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt; elevated the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and nicotinamide in the serum and kidney, resulting in reduced renal inflammation and damage to renal tubular epithelial cells. We also performed a 1-year phase 1 placebo-controlled study of oral &lt;em&gt;L. casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt; use (Chinese clinical trial registry, ChiCTR-INR-17013952), which was well tolerated and slowed the decline of kidney function in individuals with stage 3-5 CKD. These results show that oral administration of &lt;em&gt;L. casei Zhang&lt;/em&gt;, by altering SCFAs and nicotinamide metabolism, is a potential therapy to mitigate kidney injury and slow the progression of renal decline.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Artemether confers neuroprotection on cerebral ischemic injury through stimulation of the Erk1/2-P90rsk-CREB signaling pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artemether conferred neuroprotection in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artemether conferred neuroprotection on oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion-induced cell injury model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artemether promoted the activation of Erk1/2-P90&lt;sup&gt;rsk&lt;/sup&gt;-CREB signaling pathway &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability among adults. Despite the economic burden of the disease, available treatment options are still very limited. With the exception of anti-thrombolytics and hypothermia, current therapies fail to reduce neuronal injury, neurological deficits and mortality rates, suggesting that the development of novel and more effective therapies against ischemic stroke is urgent. In the present study, we found that artemether, which has been used in the clinic as an anti-malarial drug, was able to improve the neurological deficits, attenuate the infarction volume and the brain water content in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal model. Furthermore, artemether treatment significantly suppressed cell apoptosis, stimulated cell proliferation and promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), P90&lt;sup&gt;rsk&lt;/sup&gt; and cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB). Artemether protective effect was attenuated by PD98059, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, administration. Similarly, in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/RP) cell models, artemether pre-treatment induced the suppression of the intracellular ROS, the down-regulation of LDH activity, the reduction of caspase 3 activity and of the apoptosis cell rate and reversed the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. As with MCAO animal model, artemether promoted the activation of Erk1/2-P90&lt;sup&gt;rsk&lt;/sup&gt;-CREB signaling pathway. This effect was blocked by the inhibition or knock-down of ERK1/2. The present study provides evidences of the neuroprotective effect of artemether unravelling its potential as a new therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal growth hormone receptor deficiency leads to failure of alveolar progenitor cell function and severe pulmonary fibrosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have identified impaired type 2 alveolar epithelial cell (ATII) renewal in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) human organoids and severe fibrosis when ATII is defective in mice. ATIIs function as progenitor cells and require supportive signals from the surrounding mesenchymal cells. The mechanisms by which mesenchymal cells promote ATII progenitor functions in lung fibrosis are incompletely understood. We identified growth hormone receptor (GHR) is mainly expressed in mesenchymal cells, and its expression is substantially decreased in IPF lungs. Higher levels of &lt;em&gt;GHR&lt;/em&gt; expression correlated with better lung function in patients with IPF. Profibrotic mesenchymal cells retarded ATII growth and were associated with suppressed vesicular &lt;em&gt;GHR&lt;/em&gt; expression. Vesicles enriched with &lt;em&gt;Ghr&lt;/em&gt; promote ATII proliferation and diminished pulmonary fibrosis in mesenchymal &lt;em&gt;Ghr&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice. Our findings demonstrate a previously unidentified mesenchymal paracrine signaling coordinated by &lt;em&gt;GHR&lt;/em&gt; that is capable of supporting ATII progenitor cell renewal and limiting the severity of lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GPR34-mediated sensing of lysophosphatidylserine released by apoptotic neutrophils activates type 3 innate lymphoid cells to mediate tissue repair</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils migrate rapidly to damaged tissue and play critical roles in host defense and tissue homeostasis. Here we investigated the mechanisms whereby neutrophils participate in tissue repair. In an intestinal epithelia injury model, neutrophil depletion exacerbated colitis and associated with reduced interleukin (IL)-22 and limited activation of type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). Co-culture with neutrophils activated ILC3s in a manner dependent on neutrophil apoptosis. Metabolomic analyses revealed that lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) from apoptotic neutrophils directly stimulated ILC3 activation. ILC3-specific deletion of Gpr34, encoding the LysoPS receptor GPR34, or inhibition of downstream PI3K-AKT or ERK suppressed IL-22 production in response to apoptotic neutrophils. Gpr34&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited compromised ILC3 activation and tissue repair during colon injury, and neutrophil depletion abrogated these defects. GPR34 deficiency in ILC3s limited IL-22 production and tissue repair in vivo in settings of colon and skin injury. Thus, GPR34 is an ILC3-expressed damage-sensing receptor that triggers tissue repair upon recognition of dying neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) regulate the turnover of approximately 20% of mammalian cellular proteins. Neddylation of individual cullin proteins is essential for the activation of each CRL. We report herein the discovery of DI-1548 and DI-1859 as two potent, selective and covalent DCN1 inhibitors. These inhibitors selectively inhibit neddylation of cullin 3 in cells at low nanomolar concentrations and are 2–3 orders of magnitude more potent than our previously reported reversible DCN1 inhibitor. Mass spectrometric analysis and co-crystal structures reveal that these compounds employ a unique mechanism of covalent bond formation with DCN1. DI-1859 induces a robust increase of NRF2 protein, a CRL3 substrate, in mouse liver and effectively protects mice from acetaminophen-induced liver damage. Taken together, this study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of selective inhibition of cullin neddylation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic injuries remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and restoration of functional blood perfusion is vital to limit tissue damage and support healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reveal a novel role of macrophages in reestablishment of functional tissue perfusion following ischemic injury that can be targeted to improve tissue restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods and Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using intravital microscopy of ischemic hindlimb muscle in mice, and confocal microscopy of human tissues from amputated legs, we found that macrophages accumulated perivascularly in ischemic muscles, where they expressed high levels of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide [NO] synthase). Genetic depletion of iNOS specifically in macrophages (Cx3cr1-CreERT2;Nos2&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt; or LysM-Cre;Nos2&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;) did not affect vascular architecture but highly compromised blood flow regulation in ischemic but not healthy muscle, which resulted in aggravated ischemic damage. Thus, the ability to upregulate blood flow was shifted from eNOS (endothelial)-dependence in healthy muscles to completely rely on macrophage-derived iNOS during ischemia. Macrophages in ischemic muscles expressed high levels of CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4) and CCR2 (C-C chemokine receptor type 2), and local overexpression by DNA plasmids encoding the corresponding chemokines CXCL12 (stromal-derived factor 1) or CCL2 (chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2) increased macrophage numbers, while CXCL12 but not CCL2 induced their perivascular positioning. As a result, CXCL12-overexpression increased the number of perfused blood vessels in the ischemic muscles, improved functional muscle perfusion in a macrophage-iNOS-dependent manner, and ultimately restored limb function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study establishes a new function for macrophages during tissue repair, as they regulate blood flow through the release of iNOS-produced NO. Further, we demonstrate that macrophages can be therapeutically targeted to improve blood flow regulation and functional recovery of ischemic tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aagab acts as a novel regulator of NEDD4-1-mediated Pten nuclear translocation to promote neurological recovery following hypoxic-ischemic brain damage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a main cause of mortality and severe neurologic impairment in the perinatal and neonatal period. However, few satisfactory therapeutic strategies are available. Here, we reported that a rapid nuclear translocation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome TEN (PTEN) is an essential step in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD)- and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neuronal injures both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we found that OGD-induced nuclear translocation of PTEN is dependent on PTEN mono-ubiquitination at the lysine 13 residue (K13) that is mediated by neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 4-1 (NEDD4-1). Importantly, we for the first time identified α- and γ-adaptin binding protein (Aagab) as a novel NEDD4-1 regulator to regulate the level of NEDD4-1, subsequently mediating Pten nuclear translocation. Finally, we demonstrated that genetic upregulation of Aagab or application of Tat-K13 peptide (a short interference peptide that flanks K13 residue of PTEN) not only reduced Pten nuclear translocation, but also significantly alleviated the deficits of myodynamia, motor and spatial learning and memory in HIBD model rats. These results suggest that Aagab may serve as a regulator of NEDD4-1-mediated Pten nuclear translocation to promote functional recovery following HIBD in neonatal rats, and provide a new potential therapeutic target to guide the clinical treatment for HIE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cardioprotective mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitor against myocardial infarction is through reduction of autosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33417139/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus but the protective mechanism remains elusive. Here we demonstrated that the SGLT2 inhibitor, Empagliflozin (EMPA), suppresses cardiomyocytes autosis (autophagic cell death) to confer cardioprotective effects. Using myocardial infarction (MI) mouse models with and without diabetes mellitus, EMPA treatment significantly reduced infarct size, and myocardial fibrosis, thereby leading to improved cardiac function and survival. In the context of ischemia and nutritional glucose deprivation where autosis is already highly stimulated, EMPA directly inhibits the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) in the cardiomyocytes to regulate excessive autophagy. Knockdown of NHE1 significantly rescued glucose deprivation-induced autosis. In contrast, overexpression of NHE1 aggravated the cardiomyocytes death in response to starvation, which was effectively rescued by EMPA treatment. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo analysis of NHE1 and Beclin 1 knockout mice validated that EMPA&amp;rsquo;s cardioprotective effects are at least in part through downregulation of autophagic flux. These findings provide new insights for drug development, specifically targeting NHE1 and autosis for ventricular remodeling and heart failure after MI in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal stem cell-mediated immunomodulation of recruited mononuclear phagocytes during acute lung injury: a high-dimensional analysis study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33500722/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI)-recruited mononuclear phagocytes play a pivotal role in lung injury and repair. This study investigated the types of recruited mononuclear phagocytes and the immunotherapeutic effects of allograft mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice were orotracheally instilled with LPS (20 mg/kg). Compact bone-derived MSCs were administered orotracheally 4 h after LPS inhalation. Mononuclear phagocytes recruited in the lung tissues were characterized at different timepoints by high-dimensional analysis including flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Eight mononuclear phagocyte subsets recruited to LPS-challenged lungs were precisely identified. On day 3 after LPS administration, both Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes were recruited into acutely injured lungs, which was associated with increased secretion of neutrophil chemokines. Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes differentiated into M1 macrophages on day 3, and subsequently differentiated into CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) on day 7, while Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes differentiated into CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs on day 7. When ALI mice were treated with MSCs, the mortality significantly reduced. Notably, MSCs reduced the amount of M1 macrophages and reduced the secretion of neutrophil chemokines on day 3. Furthermore, MSCs reduced the number of CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mo-DCs and CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs on day 7, suppressing the antigen presentation process. Recruited mononuclear phagocyte subsets with a high level of CD38 exhibited an activated phenotype and could secrete higher levels of cytokines and chemokines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study characterized the dynamic functions and phenotypes of recruited mononuclear phagocytes in ALI mice and MSC-treated ALI mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel SIRT6 activator ameliorates neuroinflammation and ischemic brain injury via EZH2/FOXC1 axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide with limited medications and neuroinflammation was recognized as a critical player in the progression of stroke, but how to control the overactive neuroinflammation is still a long-standing challenge. Here, we designed a novel SIRT6 activator MDL-811 which remarkably inhibited inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and primary mouse microglia, which were abolished by silencing SIRT6. RNA-seq screening identified the forkhead box C1 (Foxc1) is a key gene evoked by MDL-811 stimulation and is required for the anti-inflammatory effects of MDL-811. We found MDL-811-activated SIRT6 directly interacted with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and promoted deacetylation of EZH2 which could bind to the promoter of Foxc1 and upregulate its expression to modulate inflammation. Moreover, our data demonstrated that MDL-811 not only ameliorated sickness behaviors in neuroinflammatory mice induced by LPS, but also markedly reduced the brain injury in ischemic stroke mice in addition to promoting long-term functional recovery. Importantly, MDL-811 also exhibited strong anti-inflammatory effects in human monocytes isolated from ischemic stroke patients, underlying an interesting translational perspective. Taken together, MDL-811 could be an alternative therapeutic candidate for ischemic stroke and other brain disorders associated with neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The PINK1/PARK2/optineurin pathway of mitophagy is activated for protection in septic acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33137712/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is the major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with high mortality rates. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of septic AKI. Mitophagy is an important mitochondrial quality control mechanism that selectively eliminates damaged mitochondria, but its role and regulation in septic AKI remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate the induction of mitophagy in mouse models of septic AKI induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment or by cecal ligation and puncture. Mitophagy was also induced in cultured proximal tubular epithelial cells exposed to LPS. Induction of mitophagy under these experimental setting was suppressed by pink1 or park2 knockout, indicating the role of the PINK1/PARK2 pathway of mitophagy in septic AKI. In addition, sepsis induced more severe kidney injury and cell apoptosis in pink1 or park2 knockout mice than in wild-type mice, suggesting a beneficial role of mitophagy in septic AKI. Furthermore, in cultured renal tubular cells treated with LPS, knockdown of pink1 or park2 inhibited mitochondrial accumulation of the autophagy adaptor optineurin (OPTN) and silencing Optn inhibited LPS-induced mitophagy. Taken together, these findings suggest that the PINK1/PARK2 pathway of mitophagy plays an important role in mitochondrial quality control, tubular cell survival, and renal function in septic AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal stem cells alleviate LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the proinflammatory function of Ly6C&#43; CD8&#43; T cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systemic inflammatory processes, including alveolar injury, cytokine induction, and neutrophil accumulation, play key roles in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury (ALI). The immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can contribute to the treatment of inflammatory disorders. In previous studies, the focus was on innate immune cells and the effects of MSCs on ALI through CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells remain unclear. In the present study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce ALI in mice. ALI mice were treated with MSCs via intratracheal instillation. Survival rate, histopathological changes, protein levels, total cell count, cytokine levels, and chemokine levels in alveolar lavage fluid were used to determine the efficacy of MSCs. Mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were used to characterize the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the lungs. Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are prevalent in normal mice, whereas a specialized effector phenotype expressing a high level of Ly6C is predominant in advanced disease. MSCs significantly mitigated ALI and improved survival. MSCs decreased the infiltration of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, especially Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells into the lungs. Mass cytometry revealed that CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells expressing high Ly6C and CXCR3 levels caused tissue damage in the lungs of ALI mice, which was alleviated by MSCs. The scRNA-seq showed that Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells exhibited a more activated phenotype and decreased expression of proinflammatory factors that were enriched the most in immune chemotaxis after treatment with MSCs. We showed that CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells play an important role in MSC-mediated ALI remission, and both infiltration quantity and proinflammatory function were inhibited by MSCs, indicating a potential mechanism for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immunosuppressive effects of mesenchymal stem cells on lung B cell gene expression in LPS-induced acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Immune system disorders play important roles in acute lung injury (ALI), and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment can reduce inflammation during ALI. In this study, we compared the changes in lung B cells during MSC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the effects of MSCs on lung B cells in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. MSCs were administered intratracheally 4 h after LPS. As vehicle-treated controls, mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% C57BL/6 (PBS group). Histopathological changes, survival rate, inflammatory factor levels, and the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis was performed to evaluate the transcriptional changes in lung B cells between the PBS, LPS, and LPS/MSC groups on days 3 and 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MSC treatment ameliorated LPS-induced ALI, as indicated by the reductions in mortality, the levels of chemokines and cytokines in BALF, and the severity of lung tissue histopathology in ALI mice. Lung B cells in the PBS group remained undifferentiated and had an inhibitory phenotype. Based on our scRNA-Seq results, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lung B cells in both the PBS group and LPS group were involved in chemotaxis processes and some proinflammatory pathways. MSC treatment inhibited the expression of chemokine genes that were upregulated by LPS and were related to the recruitment of neutrophils into lung tissues. Immunoglobulin-related gene expression was decreased in lung B cells of mice treated with LPS/MSC for 7 days. The DEGs regulated by MSCs were enriched in biological processes, including humoral immune response and apoptotic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Lung B cells played an important role in the effects of treatment of ALI with MSCs. These observations provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of MSC treatment for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Persistence of a regeneration-associated, transitional alveolar epithelial cell state in pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32661339/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem cells undergo dynamic changes in response to injury to regenerate lost cells. However, the identity of transitional states and the mechanisms that drive their trajectories remain understudied. Using lung organoids, multiple in vivo repair models, single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing, we find that alveolar type-2 epithelial cells undergoing differentiation into type-1 cells acquire pre-alveolar type-1 transitional cell state (PATS) en route to terminal maturation. Transitional cells undergo extensive stretching during differentiation, making them vulnerable to DNA damage. Cells in the PATS show an enrichment of TP53, TGFβ, DNA-damage-response signalling and cellular senescence. Gain and loss of function as well as genomic binding assays revealed a direct transcriptional control of PATS by TP53 signalling. Notably, accumulation of PATS-like cells in human fibrotic lungs was observed, suggesting persistence of the transitional state in fibrosis. Our study thus implicates a transient state associated with senescence in normal epithelial tissue repair and its abnormal persistence in disease conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased pulmonary vascular permeability due to endothelial cell (EC) barrier dysfunction is a major pathological feature of acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury (ARDS/ALI), which is a devastating critical illness with high incidence and excessive mortality. Activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) induces EC dysfunction via production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the role(s) of NOX isoform(s), and their downstream signaling events, in the development of ARDS/ALI have remained unclear. Cecal Ligation Puncture (CLP) was used to induce preclinical septic ALI in wild-type mice and mice deficient in NOX2 or p47phox, or mice transfected of control siRNA, NOX1 or NOX4 siRNA in vivo. The survival rate of the CLP group at 24 h (26.6%, control siRNA treated) was substantially improved by NOX4 knockdown (52.9%). Mice lacking NOX2 or p47phox, however, had worse outcomes after CLP (survival rates at 0% and 8.3% respectively), whereas NOX1-silenced mice had similar survival rate (30%). NOX4 knockdown attenuated lung ROS production in septic mice, whereas NOX1 knockdown, NOX2 knockout, or p47phox knockout in mice had no effects. In addition, NOX4 knockdown attenuated redox-sensitive activation of the CaMKII/ERK1/2/MLCK pathway, and restored expression of EC tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin to maintain EC barrier integrity. Correspondingly, NOX4 knockdown in cultured human lung microvascular ECs also reduced LPS-induced ROS production, CaMKII/ERK1/2/MLCK activation and EC barrier dysfunction. Scavenging superoxide in vitro and in vivo with TEMPO, or inhibiting CaMKII activation with KN93, had similar effects as NOX4 knockdown in preserving EC barrier dysfunction. In summary, we have identified a novel, selective and causal role of NOX4 (versus other NOX isoforms) in inducing lung EC barrier dysfunction and injury/mortality in a preclinical CLP-induced septic model, which involves redox-sensitive activation of CaMKII/ERK1/2/MLCK pathway. Targeting NOX4 may therefore prove to an innovative therapeutic option that is markedly effective in treating ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decreased Hepatocyte Autophagy Leads to Synergistic IL-1β and TNF Mouse Liver Injury and Inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β has been implicated in the pathophysiology of nonalcoholic and alcoholic steatohepatitis. How IL-1β promotes liver injury in these diseases is unclear, as no IL-1β receptor-linked death pathway has been identified. Autophagy functions in hepatocyte resistance to injury and death, and findings of decreased hepatic autophagy in many liver diseases suggest a role for impaired autophagy in disease pathogenesis. Recent findings that autophagy blocks mouse liver injury from lipopolysaccharide led to an examination of autophagy&amp;rsquo;s function in hepatotoxicity from proinflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt; AML12 cells with decreased autophagy from a lentiviral autophagy-related 5 (Atg5) knockdown were resistant to toxicity from TNF, but sensitized to death from IL-1β, which was markedly amplified by TNF co-treatment. IL-1β/TNF death was necrosis by trypan blue and propidium iodide positivity, absence of mitochondrial death pathway and caspase activation, and failure of a caspase inhibitor or necrostatin-1s to prevent death. IL-1β/TNF depleted autophagy-deficient cells of ATP, and ATP depletion and cell death were prevented by supplementation with the energy substrate pyruvate or oleate. Pharmacological inhibitors and genetic knockdown studies demonstrated that IL-1β/TNF-induced necrosis resulted from lysosomal permeabilization and release of cathepsins B and L in autophagy-deficient cells. Mice with a tamoxifen-inducible, hepatocyte-specific Atg5 knockout were similarly sensitized to cathepsin-dependent hepatocellular injury and death from IL-1β/TNF in combination, but neither IL-1β nor TNF alone. Knockout mice had increased hepatic inflammation, and IL-1β/TNF-treated, autophagy-deficient AML12 cells secreted exosomes with proinflammatory damage-associated molecular patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The findings delineate mechanisms by which decreased hepatocyte autophagy promotes IL-1β/TNF-induced necrosis from impaired energy homeostasis and lysosomal permeabilization and inflammation through the secretion of exosomal damage-associated molecular patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nuclear receptor PXR targets AKR1B7 to protect mitochondrial metabolism and renal function in AKI</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32404507/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a worldwide public health problem with no specific and satisfactory therapies in clinic. The nuclear pregnane X receptor (PXR) is involved in the progression of multiple diseases, including metabolic diseases, atherosclerosis, hypertension, liver injury, etc. However, its role in kidney injury remains to be understood. In this study, we have investigated the role of PXR in AKI and underlying mechanism(s) involved in its function. PXR was robustly down-regulated and negatively correlated with renal dysfunction in human and animal kidneys with AKI. Silencing PXR in rats enhanced cisplatin-induced AKI and induced severe mitochondrial abnormalities, whereas activating PXR protected against AKI. Using luciferase reporter assays, genomic manipulation, and proteomics data analysis on the kidneys of PXR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; rats, we determined that PXR targeted Aldo-keto reductase family 1, member B7 (AKR1B7) to improve mitochondrial function, thereby ameliorating AKI. We confirmed the protective role of PXR against kidney injury using genomic and pharmacologic approaches in an ischemia/reperfusion model of AKI. These findings demonstrate that disabling the PXR/AKR1B7/mitochondrial metabolism axis is an important factor that can contribute to AKI, whereas reestablishing this axis can be useful for treating AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upregulation of Rubicon promotes autosis during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32364533/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although autophagy is generally protective, uncontrolled or excessive activation of autophagy can be detrimental. However, it is often difficult to distinguish death by autophagy from death with autophagy, and whether autophagy contributes to death in cardiomyocytes (CMs) is still controversial. Excessive activation of autophagy induces a morphologically and biochemically defined form of cell death termed autosis. Whether autosis is involved in tissue injury induced under pathologically relevant conditions is poorly understood. In the present study, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induced autosis in CMs, as evidenced by cell death with numerous vacuoles and perinuclear spaces, and ﻿depleted intracellular membranes. Autosis was observed frequently after 6 hours of reperfusion, accompanied by upregulation of Rubicon, attenuation of autophagic flux, and marked accumulation of autophagosomes. Genetic downregulation of Rubicon inhibited autosis and reduced I/R injury, whereas stimulation of autosis during the late phase of I/R with Tat-Beclin 1 exacerbated injury. Suppression of autosis by ouabain, a cardiac glycoside, in humanized ﻿Na+,K+-ATPase-knockin mice reduced I/R injury. Taken together, these results demonstrate that autosis is significantly involved in I/R injury in the heart and triggered by dysregulated accumulation of autophagosomes due to upregulation of Rubicon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosome-based delivery of super-repressor IκBα relieves sepsis-associated organ damage and mortality</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As extracellular vesicles that play an active role in intercellular communication by transferring cellular materials to recipient cells, exosomes offer great potential as a natural therapeutic drug delivery vehicle. The inflammatory responses in various disease models can be attenuated through introduction of super-repressor IκB (srIκB), which is the dominant active form of IκBα and can inhibit translocation of nuclear factor κB into the nucleus. An optogenetically engineered exosome system (EXPLOR) that we previously developed was implemented for loading a large amount of srIκB into exosomes. We showed that intraperitoneal injection of purified srIκB-loaded exosomes (Exo-srIκBs) attenuates mortality and systemic inflammation in septic mouse models. In a biodistribution study, Exo-srIκBs were observed mainly in the neutrophils, and in monocytes to a lesser extent, in the spleens and livers of mice. Moreover, we found that Exo-srIκB alleviates inflammatory responses in monocytic THP-1 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long-Term Culture Captures Injury-Repair Cycles of Colonic Stem Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31708126/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colonic epithelium can undergo multiple rounds of damage and repair, often in response to excessive inflammation. The responsive stem cell that mediates this process is unclear, in part because of a lack of in vitro models that recapitulate key epithelial changes that occur in vivo during damage and repair. Here, we identify a Hopx&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; colitis-associated regenerative stem cell (CARSC) population that functionally contributes to mucosal repair in mouse models of colitis. Hopx&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CARSCs, enriched for fetal-like markers, transiently arose from hypertrophic crypts known to facilitate regeneration. Importantly, we established a long-term, self-organizing two-dimensional (2D) epithelial monolayer system to model the regenerative properties and responses of Hopx&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CARSCs. This system can reenact the &amp;ldquo;homeostasis-injury-regeneration&amp;rdquo; cycles of epithelial alterations that occur in vivo. Using this system, we found that hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum stress, insults commonly present in inflammatory bowel diseases, mediated the cyclic switch of cellular status in this process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting Degradation of the Transcription Factor C/EBPβ Reduces Lung Fibrosis by Restoring Activity of the Ubiquitin-Editing Enzyme A20 in Macrophages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although recent progress provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), rare anti-PF therapeutics show definitive promise for treating this disease. Repeated lung epithelial injury results in injury-repairing response and inflammation, which drive the development of PF. Here, we report that chronic lung injury inactivated the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, causing progressive accumulation of the transcription factor C/EBPβ in alveolar macrophages (AMs) from PF patients and mice, which upregulated a number of immunosuppressive and profibrotic factors promoting PF development. In response to chronic lung injury, elevated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) interacted with and phosphorylated A20 to suppress C/EBPβ degradation. Ectopic expression of A20 or pharmacological restoration of A20 activity by disturbing the A20-GSK-3β interaction accelerated C/EBPβ degradation and showed potent therapeutic efficacy against experimental PF. Our study indicates that a regulatory mechanism of the GSK-3β-A20-C/EBPβ axis in AMs may be a potential target for treating PF and fibroproliferative lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tolerogenic signaling of alveolar macrophages induces lung adaptation to oxidative injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31356919/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inhaled oxidative toxicants present in ambient air cause airway epithelial injury, inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Effective adaptation to such environmental insults is essential for the preservation of pulmonary function, whereas failure or incomplete adaptation to oxidative injury can render the host susceptible to the development of airway disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; We sought to explore the mechanisms of airway adaptation to oxidative injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; For a model to study pulmonary adaptation to oxidative stress-induced lung injury, we exposed mice to repeated nose-only chlorine gas exposures. Outcome measures were evaluated 24 hours after the last chlorine exposure. Lung mechanics and airway responsiveness to methacholine were assessed by using the flexiVent. Inflammation and antioxidant responses were assessed in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue. Using both loss or gain of function and genomic approaches, we further dissected the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in pulmonary adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Repeated exposures to oxidative stress resulted in pulmonary adaptation evidenced by abrogation of neutrophilic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. This adaptation was independent of antioxidant mechanisms and regulatory T cells but dependent on residential alveolar macrophages (AMs). Interestingly, 5% of AMs expressed forkhead box P3, and depletion of these cells abolished adaptation. Results from transcriptomic profiling and loss and gain of function suggest that adaptation might be dependent on TGF-β and prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Pulmonary adaptation during oxidative stress-induced lung injury is mediated by a novel subset of forkhead box P3-positive AMs that limits inflammation, favoring airway adaptation and host fitness through TGF-β and prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophages play an important role in structural cardiac remodeling and the transition to heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI). Previous research has focused on the impact of blood-derived monocytes on cardiac repair. Here we examined the contribution of resident cavity macrophages located in the pericardial space adjacent to the site of injury. We found that disruption of the pericardial cavity accelerated maladaptive post-MI cardiac remodeling. Gata6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages in mouse pericardial fluid contributed to the reparative immune response. Following experimental MI, these macrophages invaded the epicardium and lost Gata6 expression but continued to perform anti-fibrotic functions. Loss of this specialized macrophage population enhanced interstitial fibrosis after ischemic injury. Gata6+ macrophages were present in human pericardial fluid, supporting the notion that this reparative function is relevant in human disease. Our findings uncover an immune cardioprotective role for the pericardial tissue compartment and argue for the reevaluation of surgical procedures that remove the pericardium.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>S100a8/a9 Signaling Causes Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Cardiomyocyte Death in Response to Ischemic/Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31220942/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury is a significant clinical problem without effective therapy. Unbiased omics approaches may reveal key MI/R mediators to initiate MI/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used a dynamic transcriptome analysis of mouse heart exposed to various MI/R periods to identify S100a8/a9 as an early mediator. Using loss/gain-of-function approaches to understand the role of S100a8/a9 in MI/R injury, we explored the mechanisms through transcriptome and functional experiment. Dynamic serum S100a8/a9 levels were measured in patients with acute myocardial infarction before and after percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were prospectively followed for the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; S100a8/a9 was identified as the most significantly upregulated gene during the early reperfusion stage. Knockout of S100a9 markedly decreased cardiomyocyte death and improved heart function, whereas hematopoietic overexpression of S100a9 exacerbated MI/R injury. Transcriptome/functional studies revealed that S100a8/a9 caused mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction in cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, S100a8/a9 downregulated NDUF gene expression with subsequent mitochondrial complex I inhibition via Toll-like receptor 4/Erk-mediated Pparg coactivator 1 alpha/nuclear respiratory factor 1 signaling suppression. Administration of S100a9 neutralizing antibody significantly reduced MI/R injury and improved cardiac function. Finally, we demonstrated that serum S100a8/a9 levels were significantly increased 1 day after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute myocardial infarction, and elevated S100a8/a9 levels were associated with the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study identified S100a8/a9 as a master regulator causing cardiomyocyte death in the early stage of MI/R injury via the suppression of mitochondrial function. Targeting S100a8/a9-intiated signaling may represent a novel therapeutic intervention against MI/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corrigendum to Zhao Y, Wang C, Hong X, et al. &lt;a href=&#34;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0085253822006226&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wnt/β-catenin signaling mediates both heart and kidney injury in type 2 cardiorenal syndrome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kidney Int. 2019;95:815-829.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In type 2 cardiorenal syndrome, chronic heart failure is thought to cause or promote chronic kidney disease; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the role of Wnt signaling in heart and kidney injury in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). At 8 weeks after TAC, cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis were prominent, and echocardiography confirmed impaired cardiac function. The cardiac lesions were accompanied by upregulation of multiple Wnt ligands and activation of β-catenin, as well as activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Wnt3a induced multiple components of the RAS in primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. TAC also caused proteinuria and kidney fibrosis, accompanied by klotho depletion and β-catenin activation in the kidney. Pharmacologic blockade of β-catenin with a small molecule inhibitor or the RAS with losartan ameliorated cardiac injury, restored heart function, and mitigated the renal lesions. Serum from TAC mice was sufficient to activate β-catenin and trigger tubular cell injury in vitro, indicating a role for circulating factors. Multiple inflammatory cytokines were upregulated in the circulation of TAC mice, and tumor necrosis factor-α was able to inhibit klotho, induce β-catenin activation, and cause tubular cell injury in vitro. These studies identify Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a common pathogenic mediator of heart and kidney injury in type 2 cardiorenal syndrome after TAC. Targeting this pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy to protect both organs in cardiorenal syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Endotoxin Delivery Protein HMGB1 Mediates Caspase-11-Dependent Lethality in Sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/30314759/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hepatocyte-released HMGB1 mediates caspase-11-dependent lethality in sepsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HMGB1-LPS complexes are taken up by macrophages and endothelial cells via RAGE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HMGB1 destabilizes phagolysosomes for the transfer of LPS to cytosolic caspase-11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neutralizing extracellular HMGB1 inhibits caspase-11 activation in sepsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caspase-11, a cytosolic endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide: LPS) receptor, mediates pyroptosis, a lytic form of cell death. Caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis mediates lethality in endotoxemia, but it is unclear how LPS is delivered into the cytosol for the activation of caspase-11. Here we discovered that hepatocyte-released high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was required for caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and lethality in endotoxemia and bacterial sepsis. Mechanistically, hepatocyte-released HMGB1 bound LPS and targeted its internalization into the lysosomes of macrophages and endothelial cells via the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). Subsequently, HMGB1 permeabilized the phospholipid bilayer in the acidic environment of lysosomes. This resulted in LPS leakage into the cytosol and caspase-11 activation. Depletion of hepatocyte HMGB1, inhibition of hepatocyte HMGB1 release, neutralizing extracellular HMGB1, or RAGE deficiency prevented caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and death in endotoxemia and bacterial sepsis. These findings indicate that HMGB1 interacts with LPS to mediate caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis in lethal sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autosis is a Na&#43;,K&#43;-ATPase-regulated form of cell death triggered by autophagy-inducing peptides, starvation, and hypoxia-ischemia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/24277826/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that the selective overactivation of autophagy can cause cell death with unique morphological features distinct from apoptosis or necrosis. This unique type of autophagic cell death, termed “autosis,” occurs not only &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; but also in vivo in cerebral hypoxia–ischemia. Moreover, autosis is inhibited both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; by cardiac glycosides, which are Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase antagonists used in clinical medicine. Our findings contribute to the basic understanding of cell-death mechanisms and suggest strategies for protecting cells against stresses such as hypoxia–ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long-standing controversy is whether autophagy is a bona fide cause of mammalian cell death. We used a cell-penetrating autophagy-inducing peptide, Tat-Beclin 1, derived from the autophagy protein Beclin 1, to investigate whether high levels of autophagy result in cell death by autophagy. Here we show that Tat-Beclin 1 induces dose-dependent death that is blocked by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy, but not of apoptosis or necroptosis. This death, termed &amp;ldquo;autosis,&amp;rdquo; has unique morphological features, including increased autophagosomes/autolysosomes and nuclear convolution at early stages, and focal swelling of the perinuclear space at late stages. We also observed autotic death in cells during stress conditions, including in a subpopulation of nutrient-starved cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and in hippocampal neurons of neonatal rats subjected to cerebral hypoxia-ischemia &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. A chemical screen of ~5,000 known bioactive compounds revealed that cardiac glycosides, antagonists of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase, inhibit autotic cell death &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Furthermore, genetic knockdown of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase α1 subunit blocks peptide and starvation-induced autosis &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, we have identified a unique form of autophagy-dependent cell death, a Food and Drug Administration-approved class of compounds that inhibit such death, and a crucial role for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase in its regulation. These findings have implications for understanding how cells die during certain stress conditions and how such cell death might be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
