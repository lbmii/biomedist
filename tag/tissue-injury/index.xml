      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Necroptosis, one of the types of regulated necrosis, causes ischemia-reperfusion (IR) lung injury. N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), a calpain inhibitor, is known to attenuate necroptosis and apoptosis, and the purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of ALLN during cold ischemia against IR injury in a rat lung transplant model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male Lewis rats (250-350 g) were divided into 3 groups: sham group (n = 4), nontransplantation; control group (n = 8), transplantation with IR lung injury; and ALLN group (n = 8), transplantation with IR lung injury/ALLN. Rats in the sham group underwent a simple thoracotomy, and the remaining 2 groups of rats underwent an orthotopic left lung transplant. Cold ischemic time was 15 h. After 2 h of reperfusion, physiological function, inflammatory cytokine expression, pathway activation, and the degrees of necroptosis and apoptosis were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Lung gas exchange (PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was significantly better, and pulmonary edema was significantly improved in the ALLN group compared with the control group (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0009, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0014). Plasma expression of interleukin-1Î² was significantly lower in the ALLN group than in the control group (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0313). The proportion of necroptotic and apoptotic cells was significantly lower in the ALLN group than in the control group (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0009), whereas the proportion of apoptotic cells remained unchanged (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.372); therefore, the calpain inhibitor was thought to suppress necroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The administration of ALLN during cold ischemia appears to improve IR lung injury in a lung transplant animal model via the inhibition of necroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TFEB-mediated lysosomal exocytosis alleviates high fat diet-induced lipotoxicity in the kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36649084/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a major risk factor for end-stage kidney disease. We previously found that lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagic flux contributed to lipotoxicity in obesity-related kidney disease, both in humans and experimental animal models. However, the regulatory factors involved in countering renal lipotoxicity are largely unknown. Here we found that palmitic acid (PA) strongly promoted dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) by inhibiting the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1 (MTORC1) pathway in a Rag GTPase-dependent manner, although these effects gradually diminished after extended treatment. We then investigated the role of TFEB in the pathogenesis of obesity-related kidney disease. Proximal tubular epithelial cell (PTEC)-specific Tfeb-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibited greater phospholipid accumulation in enlarged lysosomes, which manifested as multilamellar bodies (MLBs). Activated TFEB mediated lysosomal exocytosis of phospholipids, which help reduce MLB accumulation in PTECs. Furthermore, HFD-fed PTEC-specific Tfeb-deficient mice showed autophagic stagnation and exacerbated injury upon renal ischemia-reperfusion. Finally, higher body mass index was associated with increased vacuolation and decreased nuclear TFEB in the proximal tubules of chronic kidney disease patients. These results indicate a critical role of TFEB-mediated lysosomal exocytosis in counteracting renal lipotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Timing and cell specificity of senescence drives postnatal lung development and injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36650158/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senescence causes age-related diseases and stress-related injury. Paradoxically, it is also essential for organismal development. Whether senescence contributes to lung development or injury in early life remains unclear. Here, we show that lung senescence occurred at birth and decreased throughout the saccular stage in mice. Reducing senescent cells at this stage disrupted lung development. In mice (&amp;lt;12 h old) exposed to hyperoxia during the saccular stage followed by air recovery until adulthood, lung senescence increased particularly in type II cells and secondary crest myofibroblasts. This peaked during the alveolar stage and was mediated by the p53/p21 pathway. Decreasing senescent cells during the alveolar stage attenuated hyperoxia-induced alveolar and vascular simplification. Conclusively, early programmed senescence orchestrates postnatal lung development whereas later hyperoxia-induced senescence causes lung injury through different mechanisms. This defines the ontogeny of lung senescence and provides an optimal therapeutic window for mitigating neonatal hyperoxic lung injury by inhibiting senescence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>O-linked N-acetylglucosamine affects mitochondrial homeostasis by regulating Parkin-dependent mitophagy in hyperoxia-injured alveolar type II cells injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36647045/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The level of linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) has been proved to be a sensor of cell state, but its relationship with hyperoxia-induced alveolar type 2 epithelial cells injure and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not been clarified. In this study, we evaluated if these effects ultimately led to functional damage in hyperoxia-induced alveolar cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We treated RLE-6TN cells at 85% hyperoxia for 0, 24 and 48 h with Thiamet G (TG), an OGA inhibitor; OSMI-1 (OS), an OGT inhibitor; or with UDP-GlcNAc, which is involved in synthesis of O-GlcNAc as a donor. The metabolic rerouting, cell viability and apoptosis resulting from the changes in O-GlcNAc glycosyltransferase levels were evaluated in RLE-6TN cells after hyperoxia exposure. We constructed rat Park2 overexpression and knockdown plasmmids for in vitro verification and Co-immunoprecipitation corroborated the binding of Parkin and O-GlcNAc. Finally, we assessed morphological detection in neonatal BPD rats with TG and OS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found a decrease in O-GlcNAc content and levels of its metabolic enzymes in RLE-6TN cells under hyperoxia. However, the inhibition of OGT function with OSMI-1 ameliorated hyperoxia-induced lung epithelial cell injury, enhanced cell metabolism and viability, reduced apoptosis, and accelerated the cell proliferation. Mitochondrial homeostasis was affected by O-GlcNAc and regulated Parkin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The results revealed that the decreased O-GlcNAc levels and increased O-GlcNAcylation of Parkin might cause hyperoxia-induced alveolar type II cells injurys.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulatory T cell and macrophage crosstalk in acute lung injury: future perspectives</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36646692/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) describes the injury to endothelial cells in the lungs and associated vessels due to various factors. Furthermore, ALI accompanied by inflammation and thrombosis has been reported as a common complication of SARS-COV-2 infection. It is widely accepted that inflammation and the cytokine storm are main causes of ALI. Two classical anti-inflammatory cell types, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2 macrophages, are theoretically capable of resisting uncontrolled inflammation. Recent studies have indicated possible crosstalk between Tregs and macrophages involving their mutual activation. In this review, we discuss the current findings related to ALI pathogenesis and the role of Tregs and macrophages. In particular, we review the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between Tregs and macrophages in ALI pathogenesis. Understanding the role of Tregs and macrophages will provide the potential targets for treating ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and macrophages are responsible for acute lung injury (ALI) progression through pro-/anti-inflammatory cell balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tregs and macrophages influence each other to potentiate their roles in ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the mutual interaction, new application of conventional drugs and novel insights of ALI treatment are generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The specific Tregâmacrophage crosslink in different stage of ALI needs more investigations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The curative effects of application of conventional drugs and new immunological therapy should be performed in precise clinical verifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proper control of Treg or M2 macrophage expansion in ALI treatment expects further studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Adaptor protein HIP-55-mediated signalosome protects against ferroptosis in myocardial infarction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36639542/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Myocardial infarction (MI) results in cardiac damage due to cell death and insufficient cardiomyocyte self-renewal. Ferroptosis, a novel type of cell death, has recently been shown as a key cause of cardiomyocyte death after MI. However, the complicated regulation mechanisms involved in ferroptosis, especially how ferroptosis is integrated into classical cell survival/death pathways, are still unclear. Here, we discovered that HIP-55, a novel adaptor protein, acts as a hub protein for the integration of the ferroptosis mechanism into the classical AKT cell survival and MAP4K1 cell death pathways for MI injury. The expression of HIP-55 is induced in MI. Genetic deletion of HIP-55 increased cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and MI injury, whereas cardiac-specific overexpression of HIP-55 significantly alleviated cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and MI injury. Mechanistically, HIP-55 was identified as a new AKT substrate. AKT phosphorylates HIP-55 at S269/T291 sites and further HIP-55 directs AKT signaling to negatively regulate the MAP4K1 pathway against MI injury in a site-specific manner. S269A/T291A-mutated HIP-55 (HIP-55AA), which is defective in AKT phosphorylation and significantly decreases the interaction between HIP-55 and MAP4K1, failed to inhibit the MAP4K1/GPX4 ferroptosis pathway. In line with this mechanism, cardiac-specific overexpression of HIP-55WT mice, but not cardiac-specific overexpression of HIP-55AA mice, protected cardiomyocytes against MI-induced ferroptosis and cardiac injury in vivo. These findings suggest that HIP-55 rewired the classical AKT (cell survival) and MAPK (cell death) pathways into ferroptosis mechanism in MI injury. HIP-55 may be a new therapeutic target for myocardial damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anti-angiogenic effect of exo-LncRNA TUG1 in myocardial infarction and modulation by remote ischemic conditioning</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36635484/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successful use of exosomes in therapy after myocardial infarction depends on an improved understanding of their role in cardiac signaling and regulation. Here, we report that exosomes circulating after myocardial infarction (MI) carry LncRNA TUG1 which downregulates angiogenesis by disablement of the HIF-1Î±/VEGF-Î± axis and that this effect can be counterbalanced by remote ischemic conditioning (RIC). Rats with MI induced through left coronary artery ligation without (MI model) and with reperfusion (ischemia/reperfusion I/R model) were randomized to RIC, or MI (I/R) or sham-operated (SO) control. Data from one cohort study and one randomized-controlled trial of humans with MI were also utilized, the former involving patients who had not received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and the latter patients with PCI. Exosome concentrations did not differ between intervention groups (RIC vs. control) in rats (MI and I/R model) as well as humans (with and without PCI). However, MI and I/R exosomes attenuated HIF-1Î±, VEGF-Î±, and endothelial function. LncRNA TUG1 was increased in MI and I/R exosomes, but decreased in SO and RIC exosomes. HIF-1Î± expression was downregulated with MI and I/R exosomes but increased with RIC exosomes. Exosome inhibition suppressed HIF-1Î± upregulation through RIC exosomes. VEGF-Î± was identified as HIF-1Î±-regulated target gene. Knockdown of HIF-1Î± decreased VEGF-Î±, endothelial cell capability, and tube formation. Overexpression of HIF-1Î± exerted opposite effects. Transfection and co-transfection of 293 T cells with exosome-inhibitor GW4869 and HIF-1Î± inhibitor si-HIF-1Î± confirmed the exosomal-LncRNA TUG1/HIF-1Î±/VEGF-Î± pathway. LncRNA TUG1 is a potential therapeutic target after MI with or without reperfusion through PCI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GPR97 deficiency ameliorates renal interstitial fibrosis in mouse hypertensive nephropathy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36635422/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypertensive nephropathy (HTN) ranks as the second-leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Accumulating evidence suggests that persistent hypertension injures tubular cells, leading to tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF), which is involved in the pathogenesis of HTN. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are implicated in many important pathological and physiological processes and act as important drug targets. In this study, we explored the intrarenal mechanisms underlying hypertension-associated TIF, and particularly, the potential role of GPR97, a member of the adhesion GPCR subfamily, in TIF. A deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)/salt-induced hypertensive mouse model was used. We revealed a significantly upregulated expression of GPR97 in the kidneys, especially in renal tubules, of the hypertensive mice and 10 patients with biopsy-proven hypertensive kidney injury. GPR97-/- mice showed markedly elevated blood pressure, which was comparable to that of wild-type mice following DOCA/salt treatment, but dramatically ameliorated renal injury and TIF. In NRK-52E cells, we demonstrated that knockdown of GPR97 suppressed the activation of TGF-Î² signaling by disturbing small GTPase RhoA-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization, thus inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis of TGF-Î² receptors and subsequent Smad activation. Collectively, this study demonstrates that GPR97 contributes to hypertension-associated TIF at least in part by facilitating TGF-Î² signaling, suggesting that GPR97 is a pivotal intrarenal factor for TIF progression under hypertensive conditions, and therapeutic strategies targeting GPR97 may improve the outcomes of patients with HTN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lifelong exposure to high-altitude hypoxia in humans is associated with improved redox homeostasis and structural-functional adaptations of the neurovascular unit</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36633375/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-altitude (HA) hypoxia has the potential to alter the structural-functional integrity of the neurovascular unit (NVU) in humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the first time, we examined to what extent chronic and lifelong hypoxia impacts multimodal biomarkers reflecting NVU structure-function in lowlanders and native Andean highlanders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite lowlanders presenting with a reduction in systemic oxidative-nitrosative stress and maintained cerebral bioenergetic and cerebrovascular function during chronic hypoxia, there was evidence for increased axonal injury and cognitive impairment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared to lowlanders at sea-level, highlanders exhibited elevated vascular NO bioavailability, improved dynamic regulatory capacity and cerebrovascular reactivity, comparable cerebral substrate delivery, neurovascular coupling and maintained cognition. Unlike lowlanders following chronic-HA, highlanders presented with lower concentrations of S100B, neurofilament-light chain and total-tau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These findings highlight novel integrated adaptations towards the regulation of the NVU in highlanders that may represent a neuroprotective phenotype underpinning successful adaptation to the lifelong stress of HA hypoxia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-altitude (HA) hypoxia may alter the structural-functional integrity of the neurovascular unit (NVU). Herein, we compared male lowlanders (n = 9) at sea-level (SL) and after 14-days acclimatization to 4,300 m (chronic HA) in Cerro de Pasco (CdP), PÃ©ru (HA), against sex, age and body mass index-matched healthy highlanders (n = 9) native to CdP (lifelong-HA). Serum proteins were examined to reflect NVU integrity and venous blood assayed for free radicals and nitric oxide (NO). Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was examined in conjunction with cerebral substrate delivery, dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA), cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide (CVRCO2 ) and neurovascular coupling (NVC). Psychomotor tests were employed to examine cognitive function. Compared to lowlanders at SL, highlanders exhibited elevated plasma and red blood cell NO bioavailability (P = 0.005, d = 1.549 and P = 0.003, d = 1.681), improved anterior and posterior dCA (low frequency Gain: P = 0.029, d = -1.292 and P = 0.017, d = -1.255 respectively), elevated anterior CVRCO2 (P = 0.113, d = -0.852) and preserved cerebral substrate delivery and NVC (all P = &amp;gt;0.100). In highlanders, S100B, neurofilament light-chain and T-tau were consistently lower (P = 0.018, d = -1.244, P = 0.037, d = -1.075 and P = &amp;lt;0.001, d = -3.894, respectively) and cognition comparable (all P = &amp;gt;0.100) to lowlanders following chronic-HA. These findings highlight novel integrated adaptations towards regulation of the NVU in highlanders that may represent a neuroprotective phenotype underpinning successful adaptation to the lifelong stress of HA hypoxia. Abstract figure legend We determined how the hypoxia of high-altitude across the temporal continuum of chronic through to lifelong exposure impacts the neurovascular unit (NVU) phenotype and to what extent this is subject to altered redox homeostasis. Basal multimodal biomarkers reflecting NVU structure-function were determined in lowlanders at sea-level (lifelong normoxia) and after 2 weeks acclimatization to 4,300 m (chronic hypoxia) in Cerro de Pasco, PÃ©ru (CdP) and compared to age/sex-matched highlanders native to CdP (lifelong hypoxia). Compared to acclimatized lowlanders, highlanders were characterized by elevated systemic nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, improved dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) and cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide (CVRCO2 ) and lower concentrations of S100B, neurofilament-light chain (NF-L) and total tau (T-Tau) in the face of preserved cerebral bioenergetics and cognition. Collectively, our novel findings tentatively suggest that these integrated adaptations may collectively reflect a neuroprotective phenotype to cope with the lifelong stress of high-altitude hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective effect of soloxolone derivatives in carrageenan- and LPS-driven acute inflammation: Pharmacological profiling and their effects on key inflammation-related processes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36640672/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36640672/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soloxolone derivatives (SDs) effectively ameliorate carrageenan-induced inflammation and LPS-stimulated ALI in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SDs suppress the expression of key inflammatory genes in inflamed sites and the functional activity of murine macrophages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SDs inhibit macrophage NO production by both suppression of Nos2 expression and probable direct interaction with iNOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soloxolone methyl (SM) displays cytoprotective effect on inflamed pneumocytes and does not affect their ALI-driven EMT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SM directly inhibits the activity of thrombin involved in the regulation of inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-inflammatory potential of three cyanoenone-containing triterpenoids, including soloxolone methyl (SM), soloxolone (S) and its novel derivative bearing at the C-30 amidoxime moiety (SAO), was studied in murine models of acute inflammation. It was found that the compounds effectively suppressed the development of carrageenan-induced paw edema and peritonitis as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-driven acute lung injury (ALI) with therapeutic outcomes comparable with that of the reference drugs indomethacin and dexamethasone. Non-immunogenic carrageenan-stimulated inflammation was more sensitive to the transformation of C-30 of SM compared with immunogenic LPS-induced inflammation: the anti-inflammatory properties of the studied compounds against carrageenan-induced paw edema and peritonitis decreased in the order of SAO &amp;gt; S &amp;gt; &amp;gt; SM, whereas the efficiency of these triterpenoids against LPS-driven ALI was similar (SAO â S â SM). Further studies demonstrated that soloxolone derivatives significantly inhibited a range of immune-related processes, including granulocyte influx and the expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the inflamed sites as well as the functional activity of macrophages. Moreover, SM was found to prevent inflammation-associated apoptosis of A549 pneumocytes and effectively inhibited the protease activity of thrombin (IC50 = 10.3 ÂµM) tightly associated with rodent inflammatome. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that soloxolone derivatives can be considered as novel promising anti-inflammatory drug candidates with multi-targeted mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exposure to polystyrene microplastics triggers lung injury via targeting toll-like receptor 2 and activation of the NF-ÎºB signal in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36641069/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are ubiquitous pollutants with a wide range of plastic applications. More recently, microplastics are in the air and can be inhaled into the lungs, causing respiratory diseases. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms by which microplastics may induce respiratory disease is still limited. This study used intranasal instillation to develop a model of lung injury. The histopathology result showed that the mouse lung had severe inflammatory responses, apoptosis and collagen deposition with chronic exposure to different sizes (Small: 1â5 Î¼m and Large: 10â20 Î¼m) of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPS), and the damage of smaller sizes was obvious. The expression levels of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) family, evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors, were detected, and the levels of TLR2 mRNA was significantly increased. In transfection experiments, PS-MPS increased the inflammatory response in HEK293 cells with TLR2 expression. Furthermore, exposure to small polystyrene microplastics promoted oxidative stress and apoptosis, and accelerated the process of fibrosis. Interestingly, inhibition of the NF-ÎºB signal relieves inflammation and oxidative stress, reduces apoptosis, and thus controls the fibrosis process. These results suggested that PS-MPS targeted binding to TLR2 and further exacerbated fibrosis by facilitating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis with the activation of NF-ÎºB signal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicle-encapsulated CC16 as novel nanotherapeutics for treatment of acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36635966/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is still associated with high mortality. Growing evidence suggests that Club Cell Protein 16 (CC16) plays a protective role against ALI. However, the doses of recombinant CC16 (rCC16) used in preclinical studies are supraphysiological for clinical applications. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanovesicles endogenously generated by mammalian cells. Our study demonstrated that CC16 is released via small EVs and EV-encapsulated CC16 (sEV-CC16) has anti-inflammatory activities, which protect mice from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or bacteria-induced ALI. Additionally, sEV-CC16 can activate the DNA damage repair signaling pathways. Consistent with this activity, we observed more severe DNA damage in lungs from Cc16 knockout (KO) than wild-type (WT) mice. Mechanistically, we elucidated that CC16 suppresses NF-ÎºB signaling activation by binding to Heat Shock Protein 60 (HSP60). We concluded that sEV-CC16 could be a potential therapeutic agent for ALI by inhibiting the inflammatory and DNA damage responses by reducing NF-ÎºB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LONP1 targets HMGCS2 to protect mitochondrial function and attenuate chronic kidney disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36629048/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria comprise the central metabolic hub of cells and their imbalance plays a pathogenic role in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here, we studied Lon protease 1 (LONP1), a major mitochondrial protease, as its role in CKD pathogenesis is unclear. LONP1 expression was decreased in human patients and mice with CKD, and tubular-specific Lonp1 overexpression mitigated renal injury and mitochondrial dysfunction in two different models of CKD, but these outcomes were aggravated by Lonp1 deletion. These results were confirmed in renal tubular epithelial cells in vitro. Mechanistically, LONP1 downregulation caused mitochondrial accumulation of the LONP1 substrate, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2), which disrupted mitochondrial function and further accelerated CKD progression. Finally, computer-aided virtual screening was performed, which identified a novel LONP1 activator. Pharmacologically, the LONP1 activator attenuated renal fibrosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Collectively, these results imply that LONP1 is a promising therapeutic target for treating CKD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B inhibits the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B prevents the production of ROS and reduced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onychiol B alleviates pulmonary edema, reverses inflammatory mediator TNF-Î±, IL-6, and IL-Î² secretion in lung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a devastating respiratory disorder characterized by rapid alveolar injury, uncontrolled inflammatory response, etc. Onychiol B is a cyathane diterpene originally isolated from fern plants. In this study, onychiol B can inhibit the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as NO, iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-Î± in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells by restraining the NF-ÎºB and the p38 MAPK pathway. In addition, it prevents the production of ROS and reduces the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, in the acute lung injury mouse model induced by LPS injected into the trachea, onychiol B alleviates pulmonary edema, reverses inflammatory mediator TNF-Î±, IL-6, and IL-Î² secretion in lung. In general, our data show that significant anti-ALI effects of onychiol B would render it a potential candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sesamolin Attenuates Kidney Injury, Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction, and Gut Microbiota Imbalance in High-Fat and High-Fructose Diet-Fed Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36630317/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the effects of sesamolin on kidney injury, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and gut microbiota imbalance in high-fat and high-fructose (HF-HF) diet-fed mice and explored the underlying correlations among them. The results indicated that sesamolin suppressed metabolic disorders and increased renal function parameters. Histological evaluation showed that sesamolin mitigated renal epithelial cell degeneration and brush border damage. Meanwhile, sesamolin inhibited the endotoxin-mediated induction of the Toll-like receptor 4-related IKKÎ±/NF-ÎºB p65 pathway activation. Additionally, sesamolin mitigated intestinal barrier dysfunction and improved the composition of gut microbiota. The correlation results further indicated that changes in the dominant phyla, including &lt;em&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deferribacterota&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Desulfobacterota&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroidota&lt;/em&gt;, were more highly correlated with a reduction in endotoxemia and metabolic disorders, as well as decreases in intestinal proinflammatory response and related renal risk biomarkers. The results of this study suggest that sesamolin attenuates kidney injuries, which might be associated with its effects on the reduction of endotoxemia and related metabolic disorders through the restoration of the intestinal barrier and the modulation of gut microbiota. Thus, sesamolin may be a potential dietary supplement for protection against obesity-associated kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>microRNA-33 deficiency in macrophages enhances autophagy, improves mitochondrial homeostasis, and protects against lung fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36626225/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease. Recent findings have shown a marked metabolic reprogramming associated with changes in mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy during pulmonary fibrosis. The microRNA-33 (miR-33) family of microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded within the introns of SREBP (sterol regulatory element binding protein) genes are master regulators of sterol and fatty acid (FA) metabolism. miR-33 controls macrophage immuno-metabolic response and enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, FA oxidation, and cholesterol efflux. Here, we show that miR-33 levels are increased in Broncho Alveolar Lavage (BAL) cells isolated from IPF patients compared to healthy controls. We demonstrate that specific genetic ablation of miR-33 in macrophages protects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The absence of miR-33 in macrophages improves mitochondrial homeostasis and increases autophagy while decreasing inflammatory response after bleomycin injury. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of miR-33 in macrophages via administration of anti-miR-33 Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNA-33) attenuates fibrosis in different &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; mice and human models of pulmonary fibrosis. Together, these studies elucidate a major role of miR-33 in macrophages in the regulation of pulmonary fibrosis and uncover a novel therapeutic approach to treat this disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular imaging of chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) in experimental acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36626557/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study developed a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent that detects pulmonary inflammation during acute lung injury. The PET radiotracer uptake was highest in lung regions with high macrophage influx, and quantification of radiotracer uptake strongly correlated with the expression of established inflammatory markers. Further, this PET tracer was able to monitor treatment response to a clinically relevant treatment, providing information beyond what would be obtained by other imaging modalities, like computed tomography, alone. This knowledge will enhance our ability to noninvasively characterize and monitor molecular patterns of inflammation to help develop precision medicine approaches to treat the acutely injured lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of techniques for noninvasive imaging of inflammation has challenged precision medicine management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here, we determined the potential of positron emission tomography (PET) of chemokine-like receptor-1 (CMKLR1) to monitor lung inflammation in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide-induced injury. Lung uptake of a CMKLR1-targeting radiotracer, [&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu]NODAGA-CG34, was significantly increased in lipopolysaccharide-induced injury, correlated with the expression of multiple inflammatory markers, and reduced by dexamethasone treatment. Monocyte-derived macrophages, followed by interstitial macrophages and monocytes were the major CMKLR1-expressing leukocytes contributing to the increased tracer uptake throughout the first week of lipopolysaccharide-induced injury. The clinical relevance of CMKLR1 as a biomarker of lung inflammation in ARDS was confirmed using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets which showed significant increases in &lt;em&gt;CMKLR1&lt;/em&gt; expression among transcriptionally distinct subsets of lung monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 patients vs. controls. CMKLR1-targeted PET is a promising strategy to monitor the dynamics of lung inflammation and response to anti-inflammatory treatment in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1324 Protein Contributes to Mycobacterial Persistence and Causes Pathological Lung Injury in Mice by Inducing Ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36625672/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; (Mtb) is the pathogenic agent of tuberculosis (TB). Intracellular survival plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Mtb, a process that depends on an array of virulence factors for Mtb to colonize and proliferate within a host. Reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNS and ROS) are among the most effective antimycobacterial molecules generated by the host during infection. However, Mtb has evolved a number of proteins and enzymes to detoxify ROS and RNS. Secretory protein Rv1324, as a possible thioredoxin, might also have oxidoreductase activity against ROS and RNS during Mtb infection, and it is a potential virulence factor of Mtb. In this study, we investigated the biochemical properties of Mtb Rv1324 and its role in mycobacterial survival and virulence. The results showed that the Rv1324 protein had antioxidant activity and increased the survival of &lt;em&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/em&gt; that was exposed to ROS and RNS. In addition, Rv1324 enhanced the colonization ability of &lt;em&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/em&gt; in the lungs of mice. Further, mice infected with &lt;em&gt;M. smegmatis&lt;/em&gt; harboring Rv1324 exhibited pathological injury and inflammation in the lung, which was mediated by ferroptosis. In summary, this study advances our understanding of the mechanisms of mycobacterial survival and pathogenesis, and it reveals a novel target for TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intracellular survival of &lt;em&gt;M. tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; (Mtb) plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis, which depends on various Mtb oxidoreductases that are resistant to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) that are generated by the host during Mtb infection. Secretory protein Rv1324 is a potential virulence factor of Mtb and is a possible thioredoxin that has oxidoreductase activity against ROS and RNS during Mtb infection. We investigated the biochemical properties of Mtb Rv1324 and its role in mycobacterial survival and virulence. It was confirmed that the Rv1324 protein had antioxidant activity and an increased mycobacterial resistance to ROS and RNS. In addition, Rv1324 enhanced mycobacterial persistence and induced pathological injury and inflammation in the lungs of mice by activating ferroptosis. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms of mycobacterial survival and pathogenesis, and it reveals a novel target for TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myofibroblast-Specific Inhibition of the Rho Kinase-MRTF-SRF Pathway Using Nanotechnology for the Prevention of Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36625494/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of myofibroblasts in the lung and progressive tissue scarring. Fibroblasts exist across a spectrum of states, from quiescence in health to activated myofibroblasts in the setting of injury. Highly activated myofibroblasts have a critical role in the establishment of fibrosis as the predominant source of type 1 collagen and pro-fibrotic mediators. Myofibroblasts are also highly contractile cells and can alter lung biomechanical properties through tissue contraction. . One of the ways myofibroblast activation occurs is through activation of the Rho/myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) / serum response factor (SRF) pathway, which signals through intracellular actin polymerization. However, concerns surrounding the pleiotropic and ubiquitous nature of these signaling pathways have limited the translation of inhibitory drugs. Herein, we demonstrate a novel therapeutic anti-fibrotic strategy utilizing myofibroblast-targeted nanoparticles containing a MTRF/SRF pathway inhibitor (CCG-1423) which has been shown to block myofibroblast activation in vitro. Myofibroblasts were preferentially targeted via the angiotensin 2 receptor, which has been shown to be selectively upregulated in animal and human studies. These nanoparticles were non-toxic and accumulated in lung myofibroblasts in the bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, reducing the number of these activated cells and their production of pro-fibrotic mediators. Ultimately, in a murine model of lung fibrosis, a single injection of these drug containing targeted nanoagents reduced fibrosis as compared to control mice. This approach has the potential to deliver personalized therapy by precisely targeting signaling pathways in a cell-specific manner, allowing increased efficacy with reduced deleterious off-target effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell transcriptomics reveals a mechanosensitive injury signaling pathway in early diabetic nephropathy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36627643/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36627643/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, and histopathologic glomerular lesions are among the earliest structural alterations of DN. However, the signaling pathways that initiate these glomerular alterations are incompletely understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To delineate the cellular and molecular basis for DN initiation, we performed single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing of renal cells from type 2 diabetes mice (BTBR ob/ob) at the early stage of DN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed glucose-independent responses in glomerular cell types. The gene regulatory network upstream of glomerular cell programs suggested the activation of mechanosensitive transcriptional pathway MRTF-SRF predominantly taking place in mesangial cells. Importantly, activation of MRTF-SRF transcriptional pathway was also identified in DN glomeruli in independent patient cohort datasets. Furthermore, ex vivo kidney perfusion suggested that the regulation of MRTF-SRF is a common mechanism in response to glomerular hyperfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Overall, our study presents a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of early DN, highlighting mechanosensitive signaling pathways as novel targets of diabetic glomerulopathy.Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The main e-cigarette component vegetable glycerin enhances neutrophil migration and fibrosis in endotoxin-induced lung injury via p38 MAPK activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36627690/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the effects of vegetable glycerin (VG), a main e-cigarette constituent, on endotoxin-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Mice received intratracheal administration of 30% VG in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vehicle or only PBS (control) for 4 days. On Day 5, mice received an intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (LPS group and VG + LPS group) or PBS (VG group and control group). Lung histopathology, expression of chemokine receptors, and regulatory signaling were analyzed 24 h after the Day 5 treatment. VG significantly increased ALI-associated histopathological and fibrotic changes in both the VG group and LPS-induced ALI mice (VG + LPS group). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analyses revealed that VG administration resulted in upregulation of neutrophil markers [lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus G6D (Ly6G) and myeloperoxidase (MPO)] as well as upregulation of the expression of transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²), a central mediator of fibrogenesis, in the lungs of both VG and VG + LPS groups. VG enhanced the expression of adhesion molecules [very late antigen 4 (VLA-4) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)] and increased activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) to prompt neutrophil recruitment in the lungs of mice with ALI. Intraperitoneal administration of a p38 inhibitor attenuated these histopathological changes significantly as well as VG-induced upregulation in expression of Ly6G, MPO, VLA-4, VCAM-1, TGF-Î², and collagen-1 in mice with ALI. In conclusion, VG enhances neutrophil chemotaxis and fibrosis and it amplifies the inflammatory response associated with LPS-induced ALI in the lungs via enhancement of p38 MAPK activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of short-term high-concentration exposure to PM2.5 on pulmonary tissue damage and repair ability as well as innate immune events</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36632972/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-term heavy air pollution still occurs frequently worldwide, especially during the winter heating period in some developing countries, which is usually accompanied by the temporary explosive growth of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;. The pulmonary damage caused by PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure has been determined, but there have been few studies on the repair ability after the cessation of exposure and the important role of innate immune events. This study established a short-term (30 days) high-concentration (15 mg/kg body weight) PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure and recovery (15 days of exposure cessation) model by intratracheal instillation. The results showed that short-term PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure increased the content of collagen fiber in rat lung tissue, which was significantly repaired after recovery by 15 days of exposure cessation. Meanwhile, exposure to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; also caused changes in lung epithelial function, macrophage polarization and cell autophagy function. Most of these changes could be restored or reversed to a certain extent after recovery. However, there were also some biomarkers, including CLDN18.1, SP-A, SP-D, iNOS, CD206, Beclin1, p62 and LC3B, that were still significantly different between the exposure and control groups after recovery, suggesting that some toxic effects, especially epithelial function damage, were not completely repaired. In addition, there was a significant correlation between pulmonary fibrosis and innate immunity. The present study demonstrated that short-term high-concentration exposure to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; could cause temporary lung tissue damage and related innate immune events in rats, and the repair ability existed after the cessation of exposure, but part of the damage that required special attention still persisted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cationic phosphorus dendron nanomicelles deliver microRNA mimics and microRNA inhibitors for enhanced anti-inflammatory therapy of acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36607143/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient nanomedicines to repress the repolarization of M1 phenotype macrophages and therefore inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression for anti-inflammatory therapy is still a challenging task. We report here an original gene delivery nanoplatform based on pyrrolidinium-modified amphiphilic generation 1 phosphorus dendron (C12G1) nanomicelles with a rigid phosphorous dendron structure. The nanomicelles display higher gene delivery efficiency than the counterpart materials of pyrrolidinium-modified G1 phosphorus dendrimers, and meanwhile exhibit excellent cytocompatibility. The C12G1 nanomicelles can be employed to co-deliver the miRNA-146a mimic (miR-146a mimic) and miRNA-429 inhibitor (miR-429i) to inhibit the Toll-like receptor-4 signaling pathway and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, respectively, thus causing repression of M1 phenotype alveolar macrophage polarization. The developed C12G1/miR-mixture polyplexes enable efficient therapy of lipopolysaccharide-activated alveolar macrophages &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and an acute lung injury mouse model &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. The generated cationic phosphorus dendron nanomicelles may hold promising potential for anti-inflammatory gene therapy of other inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immunity to the microbiota promotes sensory neuron regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36640762/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microbiota-induced T cells accelerate sensory neuron regeneration upon injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Injury promotes the expression of IL-17RA in dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL-17/IL-17RA axis promotes peripheral sensory neuron regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue immunity and responses to injury depend on the coordinated action and communication among physiological systems. Here, we show that, upon injury, adaptive responses to the microbiota directly promote sensory neuron regeneration. At homeostasis, tissue-resident commensal-specific T cells colocalize with sensory nerve fibers within the dermis, express a transcriptional program associated with neuronal interaction and repair, and promote axon growth and local nerve regeneration following injury. Mechanistically, our data reveal that the cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) released by commensal-specific Th17 cells upon injury directly signals to sensory neurons via IL-17 receptor A, the transcription of which is specifically upregulated in injured neurons. Collectively, our work reveals that in the context of tissue damage, preemptive immunity to the microbiota can rapidly bridge biological systems by directly promoting neuronal repair, while also identifying IL-17A as a major determinant of this fundamental process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WWOX activates autophagy to alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury by regulating mTOR</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36621327/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by acute systemic inflammatory responses that may lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The clinical course of ALI/ARDS is variable; however, it has been reported that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) play a role in its development. The fragile chromosomal site gene WWOX is highly sensitive to genotoxic stress induced by environmental exposure and is an important candidate gene for exposure-related lung disease research. However, the expression of WWOX and its role in LPS-induced ALI still remain unidentified. This study investigated the expression of WWOX in mouse lung and epithelial cells and explored the role of WWOX in LPS-induced ALI model in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we explored one of the possible mechanisms by which WWOX alleviates ALI from the perspective of autophagy. Here, we observed that LPS stimulation reduced the expression of WWOX and the autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3Î²-II (MAP1LC3B/LC3B) in mouse lung epithelial and human epithelial (H292) cells. Overexpression of WWOX led to the activation of autophagy and inhibited inflammatory responses in LPS-induced ALI cells and mouse model. More importantly, we found that WWOX interacts with mechanistic target of rapamycin [serine/threonine kinase] (mTOR) and regulates mTOR and ULK-1 signaling-mediated autophagy. Thus, reduced WWOX levels were associated with LPS-induced ALI. WWOX can activate autophagy in lung epithelial cells and protect against LPS-induced ALI, which is partly related to the mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD44-targeting Drug Delivery System of Exosomes Loading Forsythiaside A Combats Liver Fibrosis via Regulating NLRP3-mediated Pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36603210/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver fibrosis is a progressive pathological process induced by various stimuli and may progress to liver cirrhosis and cancer. Forsythiaside A (FA) is an active ingredient extracted from traditional Chinese medicine Forsythiae Fructus and has prominent hepatoprotective activities. However, the unsatisfactory pharmacokinetic properties restrict its clinical application. In this study, the nanocarrier of CD44-specific ligand Hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified milk-derived exosomes (mExo) encapsulated with FA (HA-mExo-FA) is developed. As a result, HA modification could deliver drug-loaded exosomes to the target cells and form a specific ligand-receptor interaction with CD44, thus improving the anti-liver fibrosis effect of FA. In vitro findings indicate that HA-mExo-FA could inhibit TGF-Î²1-induced LX2 cell proliferation, reduce Î±-SMA and collagen gene and protein levels, and promote the apoptosis of activated LX2 cells. In vivo results demonstrate that HA-mExo-FA could improve liver morphology and function changes in zebrafish larvae. The anti-liver fibrosis mechanism of HA-mExo-FA may be attributed to the inhibition of NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis. In addition, the effect of HA-mExo-FA on TAA-induced increase in NLRP3 production is attenuated by NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950. Collectively, this study demonstrates the promising application of HA-mExo-FA in drug delivery with high specificity and provides a powerful and novel delivery platform for liver fibrosis therapy.

      <title>Development of a 32-gene signature using machine learning for accurate prediction of inflammatory bowel disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36600111/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Numerous genes are implicated in the etiology of IBD, but the diagnosis of IBD is challenging. Here, XGBoost, a machine learning prediction model, has been used to distinguish IBD from healthy cases following elaborative feature selection. Using combined unsupervised clustering analysis and the XGBoost feature selection method, we successfully identified a 32-gene signature that can predict IBD occurrence in new cohorts with 0.8651 accuracy. The signature shows enrichment in neutrophil extracellular trap formation and cytokine signaling in the immune system. The probability threshold of the XGBoost-based classification model can be adjusted to fit personalized lifestyle and health status. Therefore, this study reveals potential IBD-related biomarkers that facilitate an effective personalized diagnosis of IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A method for preparing hydrogels with parallel wavy fibers was developed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATA with a bionic double-layer structure was prepared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATA has bionic mechanical properties and biocompatibility and can repair TA injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This approach could provide a common platform for future tissue analog preparations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian tunica albuginea (TA) is characterized by a double-layer orthogonal structure composed of stacked parallel wavy collagen fibers. During an erection, these fibers undergo sequential straightening and stretching to mediate the soft-to-firm transition. Inspired by the delicate strain-adaptive structure of natural TA, we propose an artificial TA (ATA) composed of a strain-stiffening hydrogel consisting of aligned yet crimped fibers. This delicate structure is produced via the stretching of an isotropic polyvinyl alcohol gel followed by covalent cross-linking. ATA possesses several key mechanical features of natural TA, including rapid strain stiffening over small intervals of deformation, excellent fatigue resistance to sustain cyclic bursts, and high toughness to withstand pointwise acupuncture during suturing. Furthermore, ATA displays the capability to repair injuries and restore normal erectile function of the TA-damaged penile tissue in a pig model. Our study demonstrates that ATA has great promise for penile injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress and potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mammalian tunica albuginea (TA) is characterized by a double-layer orthogonal structure composed of stacked parallel wavy collagen fibrils. A TA mimic fiber with directional crimping was synthesized in this study by stretching an isotropic polyvinyl alcohol gel followed by covalent cross-linking to permanently fix the parallel aligned curved structures. Similar to the sequential response of the crimped structure in natural TA, the curved fibers first straighten to absorb strain and then stretch to induce a soft-to-firm transition. The proposed method paves the way for building a variety of weight-bearing organizations. Through the imitation of the structure, performance matching can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary inflammation as one of the extraintestinal manifestations of ulcerative colitis (UC) has attracted extensive attention, and its pathogenesis is closely related to gut dysbiosis. &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis&lt;/em&gt; subsp. lactis BL-99 (BL-99) can alleviate osteoporosis caused by UC, but less research has been done on other extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) caused by UC. This study aimed to explore the role and potential mechanisms of BL-99 on DSS-induced pulmonary complications in colitis mice. The results showed that BL-99 decreased weight loss, disease activity index score, colonic pathology score, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6) in colitis mice. BL-99 also alleviated DSS-induced lung pathological damage by suppressing the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory monocytes, and macrophages. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed lower abundances of several potentially pathogenic bacteria (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Burkholderia, Shigella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/em&gt;) and enrichment in specific beneficial bacteria (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Adlercreutzia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis&lt;/em&gt;) in colitis mice with BL-99 treatment. Targeted metabolomics suggested that BL-99 intervention promoted the production of intestinal acetate and butyrate. Finally, we observed that the pulmonary expression of primary acetate and butyrate receptors, including FFAR2, FFAR3, and, GPR109a, was up-regulated in BL-99-treated mice, which negatively correlated with inflammatory monocytes and macrophages. Altogether, these results suggest that BL-99 might be utilized as a probiotic intervention to prevent the incidence of colitis-related lung injury owing to its ability to shape the intestinal microbiota and suppress inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiome dysregulation drives bone damage in broiler tibial dyschondroplasia by disrupting glucose homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36596826/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) with multiple incentives is a metabolic skeletal disease that occurs in fast-growing broilers. Perturbations in the gut microbiota (GM) have been shown to affect bone homoeostasis, but the mechanisms by which GM modulates bone metabolism in TD broilers remain unknown. Here, using a broiler model of TD, we noted elevated blood glucose (GLU) levels in TD broilers, accompanied by alterations in the pancreatic structure and secretory function and damaged intestinal barrier function. Importantly, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of gut microbes from normal donors rehabilitated the GM and decreased the elevated GLU levels in TD broilers. A high GLU level is a predisposing factor to bone disease, suggesting that GM dysbiosis-mediated hyperglycaemia might be involved in bone regulation. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and short-chain fatty acid analysis revealed that the significantly increased level of the metabolite butyric acid derived from the genera &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Coprococcus&lt;/em&gt; regulated GLU levels in TD broilers by binding to GPR109A in the pancreas. Tibial studies showed reduced expression of vascular regulatory factors (including PI3K, AKT and VEFGA) based on transcriptomics analysis and reduced vascular distribution, contributing to nonvascularization of cartilage in the proximal tibial growth plate of TD broilers with elevated GLU levels. Additionally, treatment with the total flavonoids from Rhizoma drynariae further validated the improvement in bone homoeostasis in TD broilers by regulating GLU levels through the regulation of GM to subsequently improve intestinal and pancreatic function. These findings clarify the critical role of GM-mediated changes in GLU levels via the gutâpancreas axis in bone homoeostasis in TD chickens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rngtt governs biliary-derived liver regeneration initiation by transcriptional regulation of mTORC1 and Dnmt1 in zebrafish</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases of end-stage liver diseases, the proliferation of existing hepatocytes is compromised, a feature of human chronic liver disease, in which most hepatocytes are dysfunctional. So far, liver transplantation represents the only curative therapeutic solution for advanced liver diseases, and the shortage of donor organs leads to high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The promising treatment is to prompt the biliary epithelial cells (BECs) transdifferentiation. However, the critical factors governing the initiation of BEC-derived liver regeneration are largely unknown. The zebrafish has advantages in large-scale genetic screens to identify the critical factors involved in liver regeneration. Here, we combined N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea screen, positional cloning, transgenic lines, antibody staining, and in situ hybridization methods and identified a liver regeneration defect mutant (lrd) using the zebrafish extensive liver injury model. Through positional cloning and genomic sequencing, we mapped the mutation site to rngtt. Loss of rngtt lead to the defects of BEC dedifferentiation, bipotential progenitor cell activation, and cell proliferation in the initiation stage of liver regeneration. The transdifferentiation from BECs to hepatocytes did not occur even at the late stage of liver regeneration. Mechanically, Rngtt transcriptionally regulates the attachment of mRNA cap to mTORC1 components and dnmt1 to maintain the activation of mTORC1 and DNA methylation in BECs after severe liver injury and prompt BEC to hepatocyte conversion. Furthermore, rptor and dnmt1 mutants displayed the same liver regeneration defects as rngtt mutation. In conclusion, our results suggest Rngtt is a new factor that initiates BEC-derived liver regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcript shortening via alternative polyadenylation promotes gene expression during fracture healing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36596777/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maturation of the 3&amp;rsquo; end of almost all eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) requires cleavage and polyadenylation. Most mammalian mRNAs are polyadenylated at different sites within the last exon, generating alternative polyadenylation (APA) isoforms that have the same coding region but distinct 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated regions (UTRs). The 3&amp;rsquo;UTR contains motifs that regulate mRNA metabolism; thus, changing the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR length via APA can significantly affect gene expression. Endochondral ossification is a central process in bone healing, but the impact of APA on gene expression during this process is unknown. Here, we report the widespread occurrence of APA, which impacts multiple pathways that are known to participate in bone healing. Importantly, the progression of endochondral ossification involves global 3&amp;rsquo;UTR shortening, which is coupled with an increased abundance of shortened transcripts relative to other transcripts; these results highlight the role of APA in promoting gene expression during endochondral bone formation. Our mechanistic studies of transcripts that undergo APA in the fracture callus revealed an intricate regulatory network in which APA enhances the expression of the collagen, type I, alpha 1 (Col1a1) and Col1a2 genes, which encode the 2 subunits of the abundantly expressed protein collagen 1. APA exerts this effect by shortening the 3&amp;rsquo;UTRs of the Col1a1 and Col1a2 mRNAs, thus removing the binding sites of miR-29a-3p, which would otherwise strongly promote the degradation of both transcripts. Taken together, our study is the first to characterize the crucial roles of APA in regulating the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR landscape and modulating gene expression during fracture healing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Staphylococcal virulence factor HlgB targets the endoplasmic-reticulum-resident E3 ubiquitin ligase AMFR to promote pneumonia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36593296/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; invades cells and persists intracellularly, causing persistent inflammation that is notoriously difficult to treat. Here we investigated host-pathogen interactions underlying intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection in macrophages and discovered that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important cellular compartment for intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection. Using CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA library screening, we determined that the autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR), an ER-resident E3 ubiquitin ligase, played an essential role in mediating intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;-induced inflammation. AMFR directly interacted with TAK1-binding protein 3 (TAB3) in the ER, inducing K27-linked polyubiquitination of TAB3 on lysine 649 and promoting TAK1 activation. Moreover, the virulence factor Î³-haemolysin B (HIgB) of &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; bound to the AMFR and regulated TAB3. Our findings highlight an unknown role of AMFR in intracellular &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infection-induced pneumonia and suggest that pharmacological interruption of AMFR-mediated TAB3 signalling cascades and HIgB targeting may prevent invasive staphylococci-mediated pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TMBIM6 prevents VDAC1 multimerization and improves mitochondrial quality control to reduce sepsis-related myocardial injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36603706/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36603706/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulatory mechanisms involved in mitochondrial quality control (MQC) dysfunction during septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) remain incompletely characterized. Transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 6 (TMBIM6) is an endoplasmic reticulum protein with Ca2+ leak activity that modulates cellular responses to various cellular stressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we evaluated the role of TMBIM6 in SCM using cardiomyocyte-specific TMBIM6 knockout (TMBIM6CKO) and TMBIM6 transgenic (TMBIM6TG) mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myocardial TMBIM6 transcription and expression were significantly downregulated in wild-type mice upon LPS exposure, along with characteristic alterations in myocardial systolic/diastolic function, cardiac inflammation, and cardiomyocyte death. Notably, these alterations were further exacerbated in LPS-treated TMBIM6CKO mice, and largely absent in TMBIM6TG mice. In LPS-treated primary cardiomyocytes, TMBIM6 deficiency further impaired mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, while defective MQC was suggested by enhanced mitochondrial fission, impaired mitophagy, and disrupted mitochondrial biogenesis. Structural protein analysis, Co-IP, mutant TMBIM6 plasmid transfection, and molecular docking assays subsequently indicated that TMBIM6 exerts cardioprotection against LPS-induced sepsis by interacting with and preventing the oligomerization of voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), the major route of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that the TMBIM6-VDAC1 interaction prevents VDAC1 oligomerization and thus sustains mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis as well as MQC, contributing to improved myocardial function in SCM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular Vesicle-Encapsulated microRNAs as Novel Biomarkers of Lung Health</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35943330/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Early detection of respiratory diseases is critical to facilitate delivery of disease-modifying interventions. Extracellular vesicle-enriched microRNAs (EV-miRNAs) may represent reliable markers of early lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; Evaluate associations of plasma EV-miRNAs with lung function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The prospective NAS (Normative Aging Study) collected plasma EV-miRNA measurements from 1996-2015 and spirometry every 3-5 years through 2019. Associations of EV-miRNAs with baseline lung function were modeled using linear regression. To complement the individual miRNA approach, unsupervised machine learning was used to identify clusters of participants with distinct EV-miRNA profiles. Associations of EV-miRNA profiles with multivariate latent longitudinal lung function trajectories were modeled using log binomial regression. Biological functions of significant EV-miRNAs were explored using pathway analyses. Results were replicated in an independent sample of NAS participants and in the HEALS (Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and Main Results:&lt;/em&gt; In the main cohort of 656 participants, 51 plasma EV-miRNAs were associated with baseline lung function (false discovery rate-adjusted &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.05), 28 of which were replicated in the independent NAS sample and/or in the HEALS cohort. A subset of participants with distinct EV-miRNA expression patterns had increased risk of declining lung function over time, which was replicated in the independent NAS sample. Significant EV-miRNAs were shown in pathway analyses to target biological pathways that regulate respiratory cellular immunity, the lung inflammatory response, and airway structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Plasma EV-miRNAs may represent a robust biomarker of subclinical lung injury and may facilitate early identification and treatment of patients at risk of developing overt lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Delay Diabetic Wound Healing by Inducing Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition via the Hippo pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36594092/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are among the most frequent complications of diabetes with significant morbidity and mortality. Diabetes can trigger neutrophils to undergo histone citrullination by protein arginine deiminase 4 (encoded by Padi4 in mice) and release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The specific mechanism of NETs-mediated wound healing impairment in diabetes remains unknown. In this study, we show neutrophils are more susceptible to NETosis in diabetic wound environments. Via in vitro experiments and in vivo models of wound healing using wide-type and Padi4 -/- mice, we demonstrate NETs can induce the activation of PAK2 via the membrane receptor TLR-9. Then PAK2 phosphorylates the intracellular protein Merlin/NF2 to inhibit the Hippo-YAP pathway. YAP binds to transcription factor SMAD2 and translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to promote endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which ultimately impedes angiogenesis and delays wound healing. Suppression of the Merlin/YAP/SMAD2 pathway can attenuate NET-induced EndMT. Inhibition of NETosis accelerates wound healing by reducing EndMT and promoting angiogenesis. Cumulatively, these data suggest NETosis delays diabetic wound healing by inducing EndMT via the Hippo-YAP pathway. Increased understanding of the molecular mechanism that regulates NETosis and EndMT will be of considerable value for providing cellular targets amenable to therapeutic intervention for DFUs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>De Novo Design of Activatable Photoacoustic/Fluorescent Probes for Imaging Acute Lung Injury In Vivo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective monitoring of the physiological progression of acute lung injury (ALI) in real time is crucial for early theranostics to reduce its high mortality. In particular, activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic molecule probes have attracted attention to assess ALI by detecting related indicators. However, the existing fluorophores often encounter issues of low retention in the lungs and slow clearance from the body, which compromise the probe&amp;rsquo;s actual capability for in situ imaging by intravenous injection in vivo. Herein, a novel near-infrared hemicyanines fluorophore (FJH) bearing a quaternary ammonium group was first developed by combining with the rational design and screening strategy. The properties of good hydrophilicity and blood circulation effectively enable FJH accumulation for lung imaging. Inspired by the high retention efficiency, the probe FJH-C that turns on fluorescence and photoacoustic signals in response to the ALI indicator (esterase) was subsequently synthesized. Notably, the probe FJH-C successfully achieved the selectivity and sensitivity toward esterase in vitro and in living cells. More importantly, FJH-C can be further used to assess lipopolysaccharides and silica-induced ALI through the desired fluo-photoacoustic signal. Therefore, this study not only shows the first activatable probe for real-time imaging of lung function but also highlights the fluorophore structure with high lung retention. It is believed that FJH and FJH-C can serve as an efficient platform to reveal the pathological progression of other lung diseases for early diagnosis and medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DerinatÂ® has an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect on the model of acute lung injury in male SD rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36642990/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simulate acute lung injury (ALI) in SD male rats they we administered intratracheally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by hyperventilation of the lungs (HVL), which lead to functional changes in the respiratory system and an increase in the blood serum concentration of inflammatory cytokines. LPS + HVL after 4 h lead to pronounced histological signs of lung damage. We have studied the effectiveness of DerinatÂ® when administered intramuscularly at dose of 7.5 mg/kg for 8 days in the ALI model. DerinatÂ® administration lead to an increase in the concentration of most of the studied cytokines in a day. In the ALI model the administration of DerinatÂ® returned the concentration of cytokines to its original values already 48 h after LPS + HVL, and also normalized the parameters of pulmonary respiration in comparison with animals without treatment. By the eighth day after LPS + HVL, respiratory parameters and cytokine levels, as well as biochemical and hematological parameters did not differ between groups, while histological signs of residual effects of lung damage were found in all animals, and were more pronounced in DerinatÂ® group, which may indicate stimulation of the local immune response. Thus, the administration of DerinatÂ® stimulates the immune response, has a pronounced protective effect against cytokinemia and respiratory failure caused by ALI, has immunomodulatory effect, and also stimulates a local immune response in lung tissues. Thus, DerinatÂ® is a promising treatment for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interdependent Nuclear Co-Trafficking of ASPP1 and p53 Aggravates Cardiac Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/23-01-01-10-14/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OBJECTIVE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASPP1 (apoptosis stimulating of p53 protein 1) is critical in regulating cell apoptosis as a cofactor of p53 to promote its transcriptional activity in the nucleus. However, whether cytoplasmic ASPP1 affects p53 nuclear trafficking and its role in cardiac diseases remains unknown. This study aims to explore the mechanism by which ASPP1 modulates p53 nuclear trafficking and the subsequent contribution to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;METHODS AND RESULTS:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immunofluorescent staining showed that under normal condition ASPP1 and p53 colocalized in the cytoplasm of neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes, while they were both upregulated and translocated to the nuclei upon hypoxia/reoxygenation treatment. The nuclear translocation of ASPP1 and p53 was interdependent, as knockdown of either ASPP1 or p53 attenuated nuclear translocation of the other one. Inhibition of importin-Î²1 resulted in the cytoplasmic sequestration of both p53 and ASPP1 in neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes with hypoxia/reoxygenation stimulation. Overexpression of ASPP1 potentiated, whereas knockdown of ASPP1 inhibited the expression of Bax (Bcl2-associated X), PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis), and Noxa, direct apoptosis-associated targets of p53. ASPP1 was also increased in the I/R myocardium. Cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic overexpression of ASPP1 aggravated I/R injury as indicated by increased infarct size and impaired cardiac function. Conversely, knockout of ASPP1 mitigated cardiac I/R injury. The same qualitative data were observed in neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. Furthermore, inhibition of p53 significantly blunted the proapoptotic activity and detrimental effects of ASPP1 both in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONCLUSIONS:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binding of ASPP1 to p53 triggers their nuclear cotranslocation via importin-Î²1 that eventually exacerbates cardiac I/R injury. The findings imply that interfering the expression of ASPP1 or the interaction between ASPP1 and p53 to block their nuclear trafficking represents an important therapeutic strategy for cardiac I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lycopene Attenuates Di(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate-Induced Mitochondrial Damage and Inflammation in Kidney via cGAS-STING Signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36583613/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a highly harmful and persistent environmental pollutant. Due to its unique chemical composition, it frequently dissolves and enters the environment to endanger human and animal health. Lycopene is a natural bioactive component that can potentially reduce the risk of environmental factor-induced chronic diseases. The present study sought to explore the role and underlying mechanism of lycopene (LYC) on DEHP-induced renal inflammatory response and apoptosis. In this study, mice were orally treated with LYC (5 mg/kg BW/day) and/or DEHP (500 or 1000 mg/kg BW/day) for 28 days. Our results indicated that LYC prevented DEHP-induced histopathological alterations and ultrastructural injuries, including decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨m), PINK1/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy, and mitochondrial energetic deficit. When damaged mitochondria release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into cytosol, LYC can alleviate inflammation and apoptosis caused by DEHP exposure by activating the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS-STING) signal pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrate that LYC can reduce mitophagy caused by DEHP exposure by activating the PINK1/Parkin pathway and then reduce renal inflammation and apoptosis through the cGAS-STING pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of oleocanthal (OC) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in chickens and its possible mechanisms. In total, 20 chickens were randomly divided into 4 groups: control (CON) group, LPS group, LPS + OC group, and OC group. LPS + OC and OC groups were intragastrically administered a 5 mg/kgÂ·d OC dose for 7 d. On d 8, the LPS group and LPS + OC group were intratracheally administered 2 mg/kg LPS for 12 h. It was found that OC ameliorated the pathological morphology and significantly suppressed apoptosis after OC treatment in LPS-induced ALI chicken (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Antioxidant capacity was higher in the LPS + OC group compared with the LPS group (P &amp;lt; 0.01). OC downregulated the related genes and proteins expression of toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-ÎºB (TLR4/NF-ÎºB) pathway in LPS group (P &amp;lt; 0.01). In conclusion, OC supplementation can alleviate LPS-induced ALI in chickens by suppressing apoptosis, enhancing lung antioxidant capacities and inhibiting TLR4/NF-ÎºB pathway activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. alleviate LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. protect mice by reducing pulmonary edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. inhibit the influx of inflammatory cells into the lung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. reduce inflammation in the lung by inhibiting TLR4/NF-ÎºB pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common respiratory disease in clinics, which is characterized by alveolar-capillary membrane loss, plasma protein leakage, pulmonary edema, massive neutrophil infiltration, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators. Rhodiola rosea L. an adaptogenic plant rich in phenylethanoloids, phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. We hope to verify the relieving effect of total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. (RTG) on ALI in mice and clarify its mechanism through this study. In this study, we identified the effect and mechanism of RTG on ALI through LPS-induced ALI mice. After RTG treatment, the pathological structure of lung tissue in ALI mice induced by LPS was significantly improved, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells was reduced. In addition, RTG reduced the production of IL-6, IL-1Î², and TNF-Î± in the serum of ALI mice and reduced the content or activity of MPO, T-SOD, GSH, and MDA in lung tissue. RNAseq analysis showed that RTG ameliorated LPS-induced ALI through anti-inflammatory, reduced immune response, and anti-apoptotic activities. The western blotting analysis confirmed that RTG could down-regulate the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-ÎºB p65, and p-IÎºBÎ±/IÎºBÎ±. These results suggest that RTG can attenuate LPS-induced ALI through antioxidants and inhibition of the TLR4/NF-ÎºB pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crosstalk between the nervous and immune systems has gained increasing attention for its emerging role in neurological diseases. Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) remains the most common medical complication of cranial radiotherapy, and its pathological mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Here, using single-cell RNA and T cell receptor sequencing, we found infiltration and clonal expansion of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T lymphocytes in the lesioned brain tissues of RIBI patients. Furthermore, by strategies of genetic or pharmacologic interruption, we identified a chemotactic action of microglia-derived CCL2/CCL8 chemokines in mediating the infiltration of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CCR5&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and tissue damage in RIBI mice. Such a chemotactic axis also participated in the progression of cerebral infarction in the mouse model of ischemic injury. Our findings therefore highlight the critical role of microglia in mediating the dysregulation of adaptive immune responses and reveal a potential therapeutic strategy for non-infectious brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The transcription factor ATF4 mediates endoplasmic reticulum stress related podocyte injury and slit diaphragm defects</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in &lt;em&gt;OSGEP&lt;/em&gt; and four other genes that encode subunits of the KEOPS complex cause Galloway-Mowat syndrome, a severe, inherited kidney-neurological disease. The complex catalyzes an essential posttranscriptional modification of tRNA and its loss of function induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster garland nephrocytes and cultured human podocytes, we aimed to elucidate the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of KEOPS related glomerular disease and to test pharmacological inhibition of ER stress related signaling as a therapeutic principle. We found that ATF4, an ER stress mediating transcription factor, or its fly orthologue Crc, were upregulated in both fly nephrocytes and human podocytes. Knockdown of Tcs3, a fly orthologue of OSGEP, caused slit diaphragm defects, recapitulating the human kidney phenotype. &lt;em&gt;OSGEP&lt;/em&gt; cDNA with mutations found in patients lacked the capacity for rescue. Genetic interaction studies in Tcs3 deficient nephrocytes revealed that Crc mediates not only cell injury, but surprisingly also slit diaphragm defects, and that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Crc activation attenuates both phenotypes. These findings are conserved in human podocytes where ATF4 inhibition improved the viability of podocytes with OSGEP knockdown, with chemically-induced ER stress, and where ATF4 target genes and pro-apoptotic gene clusters are upregulated upon OSGEP knockdown. Thus, our data identify ATF4 mediated signaling as a molecular link between ER stress, slit diaphragm defects, podocyte injury, and suggest that modulation of ATF4 signaling may be a potential therapeutic target for certain podocyte diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD-L1 upregulation promotes drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting vimentin degradation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36586643/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with high mortality and limited therapeutic options. The immune checkpoint PD1/PD-L1 axis is related to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, and upregulated expression levels of PD-L1 have been demonstrated in IPF patients. However, the mechanism of PD-L1 in pulmonary fibrosis is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated upregulated expression of PD-L1 in fibrotic lung tissues and sera of IPF patients. Bleomycin (BLM) treatment induced PD-L1 upregulation, EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition) and fibrosis-like morphology changes in human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiCs). Silencing PD-L1 attenuated BLM-induced EMT and fibrosis-like morphology changes in HPAEpiCs. In addition, we identified that PD-L1 directly binds to vimentin and inhibits vimentin ubiquitination, thereby increasing vimentin levels in HPAEpiCs. Silencing of vimentin inhibited BLM- and PD-L1-induced fibrosis in HPAEpiCs. The correlation between PD-L1 and EMT or vimentin expression was further confirmed in clinical samples and animal models. Finally, we used BLM- and paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis animal models to confirm the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects of PD-L1 silencing. Taken together, our findings suggest that upregulated PD-L1 stimulates EMT of alveolar epithelial cells by increasing vimentin levels by inhibiting vimentin ubiquitination, thereby contributing to pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting the limitation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) application in vivo, self-assembled AMPs library with specific nanostructures is expected to gradually overtake monomer AMPs libraries in the future. Peptide polymers are fascinating self-assembling nanoscale structures that have great advantage in biomedical applications because of their satisfactory biocompatibility and versatile properties. Herein, we describe a strategy for inducing the self-assembly of T9W into nanostructured antimicrobial micelles with evidently improved pharmacological properties, that is, PEGylation at the C-terminal of T9W (CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt;), an antibacterial biomaterial that self-assembles in aqueous media without exogenous excipients, has been developed. Compared with parental molecular, the CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; is more effective against &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, and its antibacterial spectrum had also been broadened. Additionally, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles had higher stability under salt ion, serum, and acid-base environments. Importantly, the self-assembled structure is highly resistant to trypsin degradation, probably allowing T9W to be applied in clinical settings in the future. Mechanistically, by acting on membranes and through supplementary bactericidal mechanisms, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles contribute to the antibacterial process. Collectively, CT9W&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; micelles exhibited good biocompatibility &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, resulting in highly effective treatment in a mouse acute lung injury model induced by &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 without drug resistance. These advances may profoundly accelerate the clinical transformation of T9W and promote the development of a combination of peptide-based antibiotics and PEGylated nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane- N, N, N&#39;, N&#39;-tetraacetic Acid Acetoxymethyl Ester Loaded Reactive Oxygen Species Responsive Hyaluronic Acid-Bilirubin Nanoparticles for Acute Kidney Injury Therapy via Alleviating Calcium Overload Mediated Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcium overload is one of the early determinants of the core cellular events that contribute to the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI), which include oxidative stress, ATP depletion, calcium overload, and inflammatory response with self-amplifying and interactive feedback loops that ultimately lead to cellular injury and renal failure. Excluding adjuvant therapy, there are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AKI. Using an adipic dihydride linker, we modified the hyaluronic acid polymer chain with a potent antioxidant, bilirubin, to produce an amphiphilic conjugate. Subsequently, we developed a kidney-targeted and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive drug delivery system based on the flash nanocomplexation method to deliver a well-known intracellular calcium chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N&amp;rsquo;,N&amp;rsquo;-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM, BA), with the goal of rescuing renal cell damage via rapidly scavenging of intracellularly overloaded Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced AKI rat model, a single dose of as-prepared formulation (BA 100 Î¼gÂ·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) 6 h post-reperfusion significantly reduced renal function indicators by more than 60% within 12 h, significantly alleviated tissular pathological changes, ameliorated tissular oxidative damage, significantly inhibited apoptosis of renal tubular cells and the expression of renal tubular marker kidney injury molecule 1, etc., thus greatly reducing the risk of kidney failure. Mechanistically, the treatment with BA-loaded NPs significantly inhibited the activation of the ER stress cascade response (IRE1-TRAF2-JNK, ATF4-CHOP, and ATF6 axis) and regulated the downstream apoptosis-related pathway while also reducing the inflammatory response. The BA-loaded NPs hold great promise as a potential therapy for I/R injury-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung injury is induced by abrupt increase in respiratory rate but prevented by recruitment maneuver in mild acute respiratory distress syndrome in rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36571572/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Gradually changing respiratory rate (RR) over time to reduce ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) has not been investigated. We hypothesized that gradual, compared to abrupt, increments in RR would mitigate VILI and that recruitment maneuver (RM) prior to abrupt increasing RR may prevent injurious biological impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Twenty-four hours after intratracheal administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, 49 male Wistar rats were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated (VT=6ml/kg, PEEP=3cmH2O) with RR increase patterns as follows (n=7/group): (1)control-1, RR=70bpm for 2h; (2) and (3)abrupt increases of RR for 1h and 2h, respectively, both for 2h; (4)shorter RR adaptation, gradually increasing RR (from 70 to 130bpm over 30min); (5)longer RR adaptation, more gradual increase in RR (from 70 to 130bpm over 60min), both for 2h; (6)control-2, abrupt increase of RR maintained for 1h; and (7)control-3, RM [CPAP=30cmH2O for 30s] followed by control-2 protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; At the end of 1h of mechanical ventilation, cumulative diffuse alveolar damage scores were lower in shorter (11.0 [8.0-12.0]) and longer (13.0 [11.0-14.0]) RR adaptation groups than in animals with abrupt increase of RR for 1 h (25.0 [22.0-26.0] p=0.035, and p=0.048, respectively) and 2 h (35.0 [32.0-39.0], p=0.003, and p=0.040, respectively); mechanical power and lung heterogeneity were lower, and alveolar integrity was higher, in the longer RR adaptation group compared with abruptly adjusted groups; markers of lung inflammation (IL-6), epithelial (CC-16) and endothelial cell damage (VCAM-1) were higher in both abrupt groups, but not in either RR adaptation group, compared with controls. RM prevented the increase in VCAM-1 and CC-16 gene expressions in the abruptly increased RR groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In mild experimental ARDS in rats, gradually increasing RR, compared with abruptly doing so, can mitigate the development of VILI. In addition, recruitment maneuver prevented the injurious biological impact of abrupt increases in RR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tripterin liposome relieves severe acute respiratory syndrome as a potent COVID-19 treatment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 15-30% of patients are likely to develop COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are still few effective and well-understood therapies available. Novel variants and short-lasting immunity are posing challenges to vaccine efficacy, so finding antiviral and antiinflammatory treatments remains crucial. Here, tripterin (TP), a traditional Chinese medicine, was encapsulated into liposome (TP lipo) to investigate its antiviral and antiinflammatory effects in severe COVID-19. By using two severe COVID-19 models in human ACE2-transgenic (hACE2) mice, an analysis of TP lipo&amp;rsquo;s effects on pulmonary immune responses was conducted. Pulmonary pathological alterations and viral burden were reduced by TP lipo treatment. TP lipo inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication and hyperinflammation in infected cells and mice, two crucial events in severe COVID-19 pathophysiology, it is a promising drug candidate to treat SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UHRF1-mediated ferroptosis promotes pulmonary fibrosis via epigenetic repression of GPX4 and FSP1 genes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36566325/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis (PF), as an end-stage clinical phenotype of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), is frequently initiated after alveolar injury, in which ferroptosis has been identified as a critical event aggravating the pathophysiological progression of this disease. Here in, a comprehensive analysis of two mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis developed in our lab demonstrated that lung damage-induced ferroptosis of alveolar epithelial Type2 cells (AEC2) significantly accumulates during the development of pulmonary fibrosis while ferroptosis suppressor genes GPX4 and FSP1 are dramatically inactivated. Mechanistically, upregulation of de novo methylation regulator Uhrf1 sensitively elevates CpG site methylation levels in promoters of both GPX4 and FSP1 genes and induces the epigenetic repression of both genes, subsequently leading to ferroptosis in chemically interfered AEC2 cells. Meanwhile, specific inhibition of UHRF1 highly arrests the ferroptosis formation and blocks the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in both of our research models. This study first, to our knowledge, identified the involvement of Uhrf1 in mediating the ferroptosis of chemically injured AEC2s via de novo promoter-specific methylation of both GPX4 and FSP1 genes, which consequently accelerates the process of pulmonary fibrosis. The above findings also strongly suggested Uhrf1 as a novel potential target in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Peptide Vaccine Against ADAMTS-7 Ameliorates Atherosclerosis and Postinjury Neointima Hyperplasia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36562301/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36562301/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The metalloprotease ADAMTS-7 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 7) is a novel locus associated with human coronary atherosclerosis. ADAMTS-7 deletion protects against atherosclerosis and vascular restenosis in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We designed 3 potential vaccines consisting of distinct B cell epitopic peptides derived from ADAMTS-7 and conjugated with the carrier protein KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) as well as aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. Arterial ligation or wire injury was used to induce neointima in mice, whereas &lt;em&gt;ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LDLR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (low-density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR) mice fed a high-fat diet were applied to assess atherosclerosis. In addition, coronary stent implantation was performed on vaccine-immunized Bama miniature pigs, followed by optical coherence tomography to evaluate coronary intimal hyperplasia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A vaccine, ATS7vac, was screened out from 3 candidates to effectively inhibit intimal thickening in murine carotid artery ligation models after vaccination. As well, immunization with ATS7vac alleviated neointima formation in murine wire injury models and mitigated atherosclerotic lesions in both hyperlipidemic &lt;em&gt;ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LDLR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice without lowering lipid levels. Preclinically, ATS7vac markedly impeded intimal hyperplasia in swine stented coronary arteries, but without significant immune-related organ injuries. Mechanistically, ATS7vac vaccination produced specific antibodies against ADAMTS-7, which markedly repressed ADAMTS-7-mediated COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein) and TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) degradation and subsequently inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell migration but promoted re-endothelialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; ATS7vac is a novel atherosclerosis vaccine that also alleviates in-stent restenosis. The application of ATS7vac would be a complementary therapeutic avenue to the current lipid-lowering strategy for atherosclerotic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chimeric efferocytic receptors improve apoptotic cell clearance and alleviate inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36563662/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design of chimeric receptors for efferocytosis (CHEF) to enhance efferocytosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boosting efferocytosis via CHEF attenuates multiple inflammatory insults &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protein folding and misfolded protein degradation are rate-limiting steps in efferocytosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHEF expression can improve outcomes in ongoing disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies turn over billions of cells daily via apoptosis and are in turn cleared by phagocytes via the process of &amp;ldquo;efferocytosis.&amp;rdquo; Defects in efferocytosis are now linked to various inflammatory diseases. Here, we designed a strategy to boost efferocytosis, denoted &amp;ldquo;chimeric receptor for efferocytosis&amp;rdquo; (CHEF). We fused a specific signaling domain within the cytoplasmic adapter protein ELMO1 to the extracellular phosphatidylserine recognition domains of the efferocytic receptors BAI1 or TIM4, generating BELMO and TELMO, respectively. CHEF-expressing phagocytes display a striking increase in efferocytosis. In mouse models of inflammation, BELMO expression attenuates colitis, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. In mechanistic studies, BELMO increases ER-resident enzymes and chaperones to overcome protein-folding-associated toxicity, which was further validated in a model of ER-stress-induced renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Finally, TELMO introduction after onset of kidney injury significantly reduced fibrosis. Collectively, these data advance a concept of chimeric efferocytic receptors to boost efferocytosis and dampen inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiota modulates lung fibrosis severity following acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36543914/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent studies demonstrate the significance of gut microbiota on the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases; yet little is known regarding the role of the gut microbiota in lung fibrosis progression. Here we show, using the bleomycin murine model to quantify lung fibrosis in C57BL/6 J mice housed in germ-free, animal biosafety level 1 (ABSL-1), or animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL-2) environments, that germ-free mice are protected from lung fibrosis, while ABSL-1 and ABSL-2 mice develop mild and severe lung fibrosis, respectively. Metagenomic analysis reveals no notable distinctions between ABSL-1 and ABSL-2 lung microbiota, whereas greater microbial diversity, with increased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacilli, is present in ABSL-1 compared to ABSL-2 gut microbiota. Flow cytometric analysis reveals enhanced IL-6/STAT3/IL-17A signaling in pulmonary CD4 + T cells of ABSL-2 mice. Fecal transplantation of ABSL-2 stool into germ-free mice recapitulated more severe fibrosis than transplantation of ABSL-1 stool. Lactobacilli supernatant reduces collagen 1 A production in IL-17A- and TGFÎ²1-stimulated human lung fibroblasts. These findings support a functional role of the gut microbiota in augmenting lung fibrosis severity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inheritance of paternal DNA damage by histone-mediated repair restriction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36544019/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How paternal exposure to ionizing radiation affects genetic inheritance and disease risk in the offspring has been a long-standing question in radiation biology. In humans, nearly 80% of transmitted mutations arise in the paternal germline1, but the transgenerational effects of ionizing radiation exposure has remained controversial and the mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that in sex-separated Caenorhabditis elegans strains, paternal, but not maternal, exposure to ionizing radiation leads to transgenerational embryonic lethality. The offspring of irradiated males displayed various genome instability phenotypes, including DNA fragmentation, chromosomal rearrangement and aneuploidy. Paternal DNA double strand breaks were repaired by maternally provided error-prone polymerase theta-mediated end joining. Mechanistically, we show that depletion of an orthologue of human histone H1.0, HIS-24, or the heterochromatin protein HPL-1, could significantly reverse the transgenerational embryonic lethality. Removal of HIS-24 or HPL-1 reduced histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation and enabled error-free homologous recombination repair in the germline of the F1 generation from ionizing radiation-treated P0 males, consequently improving the viability of the F2 generation. This work establishes the mechanistic underpinnings of the heritable consequences of paternal radiation exposure on the health of offspring, which may lead to congenital disorders and cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resolution of post-lung transplant ischemia-reperfusion injury is modulated via Resolvin D1-FPR2 and Maresin 1-LGR6 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36628837/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Dysregulation of inflammation-resolution pathways leads to postlung transplant (LTx) ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and allograft dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that combined treatment with specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, that is, Resolvin D1 (RvD1) and Maresin-1 (MaR1), enhances inflammation-resolution of lung IR injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Expression of RvD1 and MaR1 was analyzed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients on days 0, 1, and 7 post-LTx. Lung IR injury was evaluated in C57BL/6 (WT), FPR2-/-, and LGR6 siRNA treated mice using a hilar-ligation model with or without administration with RvD1 and/or MaR1. A donation after circulatory death and murine orthotopic lung transplantation model was used to evaluate the protection by RvD1 and MaR1 against lung IR injury. In vitro studies analyzed alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cell activation after treatment with RvD1 or MaR1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; RvD1 and MaR1 expressions in BAL from post-LTx patients was significantly increased on day 7 compared to days 0 and 1. Concomitant RvD1 and MaR1 treatment significantly mitigated early pulmonary inflammation and lung IR injury in WT mice, which was regulated via FPR2 and LGR6 receptors. In the murine orthotopic donation after cardiac death LTx model, RvD1 and MaR1 treatments significantly attenuated lung IR injury and increased PaO2 levels compared to saline-treated controls. Mechanistically, RvD1/FPR2 signaling on alveolar macrophages attenuated HMGB1 and TNF-Î± secretion and upregulated uptake of macrophage-dependent apoptotic neutrophils (efferocytosis), whereas MaR1/LGR6 signaling mitigated CXCL1 secretion by epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Bioactive proresolving lipid mediator-dependent signaling that is, RvD1/FPR2 and MaR1/LGR6- offers a novel therapeutic strategy in post-LTx injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The transcription factor Fosl1 preserves Klotho expression and protects from acute kidney injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased expression of AP-1 transcription factor components has been reported in acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the role of specific components, such as Fosl1, in tubular cells or AKI is unknown. Upstream regulator analysis of murine nephrotoxic AKI transcriptomics identified AP-1 as highly upregulated. Among AP-1 canonical components, Fosl1 was found to be upregulated in two transcriptomics datasets from nephrotoxic murine AKI induced by folic acid or cisplatin and from proximal tubular cells exposed to TWEAK, a cytokine mediator of AKI. Fosl1 was minimally expressed in the kidneys of control uninjured mice. Increased Fosl1 protein was localized to proximal tubular cell nuclei in AKI. In human AKI, FOSL1 was found present in proximal tubular cells in kidney sections and in urine along with increased urinary FOSL1 mRNA. Selective Fosl1 deficiency in proximal tubular cells (Fosl1Îtub) increased the severity of murine cisplatin- or folate-induced AKI as characterized by lower kidney function, more severe kidney inflammation and Klotho downregulation. Indeed, elevated AP-1 activity was observed after cisplatin-induced AKI in Fosl1Îtub mice compared to wild type mice. More severe Klotho downregulation preceded more severe kidney dysfunction. The Klotho promoter was enriched in Fosl1 binding sites and Fosl1 bound to the Klotho promoter in cisplatin-AKI. In cultured proximal tubular cells, Fosl1 targeting increased the proinflammatory response and downregulated Klotho. In vivo, recombinant Klotho administration protected Fosl1Îtub mice from cisplatin-AKI. Thus, increased proximal tubular Fosl1 expression during AKI is an adaptive response, preserves Klotho. and limits the severity of tubular cell injury and AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its inflammatory form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), have quickly risen to become the most prevalent chronic liver disease in the Western world and are risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is not only one of the most common cancers but is also highly lethal. Nevertheless, there are currently no clinically approved drugs for NAFLD, and NASH-induced HCC poses a unique metabolic microenvironment that may influence responsiveness to certain treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the pathogenesis of this rampant disease to devise new therapies. In this line, preclinical mouse models are crucial tools to investigate mechanisms as well as novel treatment modalities during the pathogenesis of NASH and subsequent HCC in preparation for human clinical trials. Although, there are numerous genetically induced, diet-induced and toxin-induced models of NASH, not all of these models faithfully phenocopy and mirror the human pathology very well. In this Perspective, we shed some light onto the most widely used mouse models of NASH and highlight some of the key advantages and disadvantages of the various models with an emphasis on &amp;lsquo;Western diets&amp;rsquo;, which are increasingly recognized as some of the best models in recapitulating the human NASH pathology and comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BAP31 regulates the expression of ICAM-1/VCAM-1 via MyD88/NF-ÎºB pathway in acute lung injury mice model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549351/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; The cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that mediate neutrophil-endothelium cell adhesion are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). B-cell receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31) has been reported to engage in the expression of some CAMs. This study was undertaken to explore whether BAP31 in endotheliocyte affects the pathological process of ALI by regulating CAMs, and its possible mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; Our study used the shBAP31 endothelium cell lines and endothelial-specific BAP31 conditional knockdown mice constructed via Cre/loxP system. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the histopathological manifestations. The adhesion of neutrophils to vascular wall was examined by intravital microscopy. The nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB was observed by immunofluorescence staining assay. Flow cytometric, real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assay were performed to determine the expression of CAMs and key proteins in MyD88/NF-ÎºB-related signaling pathway. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were analyzed for transcriptional activity of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; Mechanistic investigations indicated that endothelium-specific BAP31 depletion dramatically reduced the capacity of neutrophils adherence to endothelial cells (ECs), which was mainly attributed to the significant downregulation of ICAM-1 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and VCAM-1 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) expression. Interestingly, BAP31 knockdown apparently deactivated MyD88/TRAF6-mediated TAK1/NF-ÎºB and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades, resulting in the inhibition of NF-ÎºB activation and nuclear translocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; Our data furnished convincing evidence that BAP31 deficiency performs a mitigative effect on ALI by decreasing neutrophils-ECs adhesion. These findings identified BAP31 as a promising protein for regulating the pathogenesis process of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging roles of mechanosensitive ion channels in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36539808/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a devastating respiratory disorder with high rates of mortality and morbidity, but the detailed underlying mechanisms of ALI/ARDS remain largely unknown. Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), including epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Piezo channels, transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), and two-pore domain potassium ion (K2P) channels, are highly expressed in lung tissues, and the activity of these MSCs can be modulated by mechanical forces (e.g., mechanical ventilation) and other stimuli (e.g., LPS, hyperoxia). Dysfunction of MSCs has been found in various types of ALI/ARDS, and MSCs play a key role in regulating alveolar fluid clearance, alveolar epithelial/endothelial barrier function, the inflammatory response and surfactant secretion in ALI/ARDS lungs. Targeting MSCs exerts therapeutic effects in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. In this review, we summarize the structure and functions of several well-recognized MSCs, the role of MSCs in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and recent advances in the pharmacological and molecular modulation of MSCs in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. According to the current literature, targeting MSCs might be a very promising therapeutic approach against ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kir4.2 mediates proximal potassium effects on glutaminase activity and kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36543132/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; deficiency causes kidney-specific injury and inflammation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Injury effects are dependent on the proximal K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Kir4.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kir4.2 mediates activation of the ammoniagenesis pathway under low-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kidney deletion of glutaminase prevents low-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated kidney injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inadequate potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) consumption correlates with increased mortality and poor cardiovascular outcomes. Potassium effects on blood pressure have been described previously; however, whether or not low K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; independently affects kidney disease progression remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that dietary K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; deficiency causes direct kidney injury. Effects depend on reduced blood K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and are kidney specific. In response to reduced K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the channel Kir4.2 mediates altered proximal tubule (PT) basolateral K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux, causing intracellular acidosis and activation of the enzyme glutaminase and the ammoniagenesis pathway. Deletion of either Kir4.2 or glutaminase protects from low-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; injury. Reduced K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;also mediates injury and fibrosis in a model of aldosteronism. These results demonstrate that the PT epithelium, like the distal nephron, is K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sensitive, with reduced blood K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; causing direct PT injury. Kir4.2 and glutaminase are essential mediators of this injury process, and we identify their potential for future targeting in the treatment of chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PI3K/AKT-mediated autophagy inhibition facilitates mast cell activation to enhance severe inflammatory lung injury in influenza A virus- and secondary Staphylococcus aureus-infected mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36549394/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality each year globally, and secondary bacterial infection further exacerbates the severity and fatality of the initial viral infection. Mast cells have substantial roles in protecting the respiratory tract mucosa, while their role in viral and bacterial co-infection remains unclear. The present study revealed that secondary Staphylococcus aureus infection significantly aggravated the activation of mast cells during the initial H1N1 infection both in vivo and in vitro, which was closely related to the increased inflammatory lung injury and mortality. Meanwhile, the secondary S. aureus infection suppressed autophagy and promoted inflammatory mediators released by mast cells through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Blocking PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation, could rescue autophagy and inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, based on the influenza A viral and secondary bacterial infected mice model, we showed that the combination of LY294002 and antiviral drug oseltamivir could effectively reduce the inflammatory damage and pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing in lungs, recovering body weight loss and improving the survival rate from the co-infections. In conclusion, secondary bacterial infection can inhibit autophagy and stimulate mast cell activation through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which might explain why secondary bacterial infection would cause severe and fatal consequences following an initial influenza A viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Î²-hydroxybutyrate inhibits ferroptosis-mediated pancreatic damage in acute liver failure through the increase of H3K9bhb</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferroptosis contributes to pancreatic injury after acute liver failure (ALF)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Î²-hydroxybutyrate (Î²-HB) restoration alleviates pancreatic injury after ALF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Î²-HB induces enrichment of H3K9bhb in the promotor regions of ferroptosis-suppressor genes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Î²-HB regulates chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression of ferroptosis-suppressor genes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia are often seen in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study describes pancreatic tissue damage and exocrine dysfunction in a mouse model of major-liver-resection-induced ALF. The analysis of 1,264 clinical cases of liver failure (LF) showed that the incidence of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia in patients with LF is 5.5% and 20%, respectively. Metabolomic studies indicate that glutathione (GSH)-deficiency-caused ferroptosis contributes to pancreatic damage in mouse ALF. Î²-hydroxybutyrate (Î²-HB) is the only metabolite downregulated in the liver, serum, and pancreas. Our data suggest that Î²-HB protects pancreatic cells and tissues from GSH-deficiency-caused ferroptosis. Î²-HB administration in ALF mice restores the expression of ferroptosis-suppressor genes through histone H3 lysine 9 Î²-hydroxybutyrylation (H3K9bhb)-mediated chromatin opening. Our findings highlight Î²-HB as an endogenous metabolite regulating ferroptosis in the pancreas and extend our understanding of the pathophysiology of ALF-induced pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peritubular capillaries (PTCs) are closely related to renal tubules in structure and function, and both are pivotal regulators in the development and progression of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the mechanisms that underlie the interaction between PTCs and tubules during AKI remain unclear. Here we explored a new mode of tubulovascular crosstalk mediated by small extracellular vesicles (sEV) after AKI. In response to renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, endothelial proliferation of PTCs and tubular expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) were increased, accompanied by a remarkable redistribution of cytoplasmic VEGF-A to the basolateral side of tubular cells. Meanwhile, the secretion mode of VEGF-A was converted in the injured tubular cells, which showed a much greater tendency to secrete VEGF-A via sEV other than the free form. Interestingly, tubular cell-derived VEGF-A-enriched sEV (sEV-VEGF-A) turned out to promote endothelial proliferation which was regulated by VEGF receptors 1 and 2. Furthermore, inhibition of renal sEV secretion by Rab27a knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in the proliferation of peritubular endothelial cells in vivo. Importantly, taking advantage of the newly recognized endogenous repair response of PTCs, exogenous supplementation of VEGF-A + sEV efficiently recused PTC rarefaction, improved renal perfusion, and halted the AKI to CKD transition. Taken together, our study uncovered a novel intrinsic repair response after AKI through renal tubule-PTC crosstalk via sEV-VEGF-A, which could be exploited as a promising therapeutic angiogenesis strategy in diseases with ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hepatic neddylation deficiency triggers fatal liver injury via inducing NF-ÎºB-inducing kinase in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36526632/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conjugation of neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 8 (NEDD8) to target proteins, termed neddylation, participates in many cellular processes and is aberrant in various pathological diseases. Its relevance to liver function and failure remains poorly understood. Herein, we show dysregulated expression of NAE1, a regulatory subunit of the only NEDD8 E1 enzyme, in human acute liver failure. Embryonic- and adult-onset deletion of NAE1 in hepatocytes causes hepatocyte death, inflammation, and fibrosis, culminating in fatal liver injury in mice. Hepatic neddylation deficiency triggers oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hepatocyte reprogramming, potentiating liver injury. Importantly, NF-ÎºB-inducing kinase (NIK), a serine/Thr kinase, is a neddylation substrate. Neddylation of NIK promotes its ubiquitination and degradation. Inhibition of neddylation conversely causes aberrant NIK activation, accentuating hepatocyte damage and inflammation. Administration of N-acetylcysteine, a glutathione surrogate and antioxidant, mitigates liver failure caused by hepatic NAE1 deletion in adult male mice. Therefore, hepatic neddylation is important in maintaining postnatal and adult liver homeostasis, and the identified neddylation targets/pathways provide insights into therapeutically intervening acute liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inappropriate accumulation of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and subsequent excessive production of immune responses play critical roles in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI), but the core negative regulators governing innate signalling in AMs are ill defined. We have previously shown that single immunoglobin IL-1 receptor-related protein (SIGIRR), a negative regulator of IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor signalling, inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in AMs. To address the biological relevance of SIGIRR in vivo, we generated a murine ALI model via intratracheal instillation of LPS. Intriguingly, SIGIRR expression was observed to be decreased in resident and recruited macrophages during ALI. This decrease was associated with parallel induction in CD18 protein levels in LPS-challenged lung tissues. Through intranasal injection of SIGIRR lentiviral particles studies, we showed that the overexpression of SIGIRR attenuated recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils, decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and ameliorated pathological changes in lungs. Whilst exploring the basis for this phenotype, SIGIRR was found to be coexpressed with CD18 in AMs, and SIGIRR potentiated the instability of CD18 protein via enhancement of its ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Conversely, by using CD18-/- mice, we further observed that CD18 deletion completely abolished the therapeutic effects of overexpression of SIGIRR on LPS-induced ALI. Mover, overexpression of CD18 in AMs promoted adhesion to ECM components, enhanced TLR4-mediated inflammasome activation and thereby potentiated IL-1Î² production. These data collectively identify SIGIRR/CD18 as a key negative regulatory circuit maintaining innate immune homeostasis in AMs along the pathogenesis of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional reconstruction of the basal ganglia neural circuit by human striatal neurons in hypoxic-ischaemic injured brain</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36516880/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy is the leading cause of neonatal death and permanent neurological deficits, while the basal ganglia is one of the major nuclei that is selectively and greatly affected in the brains of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy patients, especially in severe cases. Human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons have shown great potential in different types of brain disorders in adults. However, it remains unknown whether and how grafted human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons can repair immature brains with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Here, by administrating genetically labelled human embryonic stem cell-derived striatal neural progenitors into the ipsilateral striatum of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy-injured mice, we found that the grafted cells gradually matured into GABA spiny projection neurons morphologically and electrophysiologically, and significantly rescued the area loss of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy-injured brains. Intriguingly, using immunohistochemical staining combined with enhanced ascorbate peroxidase-based immunoelectron microscopy and rabies virus-mediated trans-synaptic tracing, we show that the grafts start to extend axonal projections to the endogenous target areas (globus pallidus externa, globus pallidus internus, substantia nigra), form synapses with host striatal, globus pallidus and nigra neurons, and receive extensive and stable synaptic inputs as early as 2 months post-transplantation. Importantly, we further demonstrated functional neural circuits re-established between the grafted neurons and host cortical, striatal and substantial nigra neurons at 3-6 months post-transplantation in the hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy-injured brain by optogenetics combined with electrophysiological recording. Finally, the transplanted striatal spiny projection neurons but not spinal GABA neurons restored the motor defects of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, which were reversed by clozapine-N-oxide-based inhibition of graft function. These findings demonstrate anatomical and functional reconstruction of the basal ganglia neural circuit including multiple loops by striatal spiny projection neurons in hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy-injured immature brains, which raises the possibility of such a cell replacement therapeutic strategy for hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy in neonates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heparan sulfate proteoglycan-mediated internalization of extracellular vesicles ameliorates liver fibrosis by targeting hepatic stellate cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/22-12-14-10-24/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence shows that stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown great promise for tissue regeneration and are considered an alternative to cell-based therapy. However, the mechanisms by which EVs induce tissue repair have not been well demonstrated. Previous work indicates that activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) may contribute to the progression of liver fibrosis. Here, we investigate the therapeutic potential of EVs derived from human placental mesenchymal stem cells (hP-MSCs) for the treatment of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury. Our data revealed that EVs derived from hP-MSCs effectively ameliorate liver injury by attenuating inflammation and fibrosis. Further data revealed that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the surface of HSCs mediate the internalization of EVs. Furthermore, EVs could inhibit the epithelialâmesenchymal transition (EMT) process in HSCs through the downregulated TGF-/Smad pathway, which was mediated by miR-744-5p in EVs. Meanwhile, glycosaminoglycans on the surface of EVs play a crucial anti-inflammatory role. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that hP-MSC-derived EVs promote the recovery of liver injury by targeting HSPGs on HSCs and inhibiting liver inflammation through glycosaminoglycans from EVs. These findings may provide a novel theoretical basis for the treatment of liver fibrosis based on EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Locally organised and activated Fth1hi neutrophils aggravate inflammation of acute lung injury in an IL-10-dependent manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36513690/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common respiratory critical syndrome with no effective therapeutic intervention. Neutrophils function in the overwhelming inflammatory process of acute lung injury (ALI) caused by ARDS; however, the phenotypic heterogeneity of pulmonary neutrophils in ALI/ARDS remains largely unknown. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify two transcriptionally and functionally heterogeneous neutrophil populations (Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu and Prok2&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu) with distinct locations in LPS-induced ALI mouse lungs. Exposure to LPS promotes the Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu subtype, with more inflammatory factors, stronger antioxidant, and decreased apoptosis under the regulation of interleukin-10. Furthermore, prolonged retention of Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu within lung tissue aggravates inflammatory injury throughout the development of ALI/ARDS. Notably, ARDS patients have high ratios of Fth1 to Prok2 expression in pulmonary neutrophils, suggesting that the Fth1&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; Neu population may promote the pathological development and provide a marker of poor outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reprogramming transcription after DNA damage: recognition, response, repair, and restart</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36513571/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent advances in elucidating the role of transcription in DNA damage repair reveal that it has both beneficial and adverse effects on genome stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNA lesion-stalled RNA polymerase (Pol) II triggers the transcription-coupled DNA repair pathway, which involves multiple regulatory factors acting in a concerted and sequential manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transcription is rapidly shut down by DNA damage response (DDR) master regulators, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), using mechanisms that include the direct inhibition of Pol II elongation and the establishment of repressive chromatin environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the damaged DNA is repaired, multiple mechanisms exist to ensure proper and timely restoration of transcription. The inhibition of this process undermines genomic integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome integrity is constantly challenged by endogenous and exogenous insults that cause DNA damage. To cope with these threats, cells have a surveillance mechanism, known as the DNA damage response (DDR), to repair any lesions. Although transcription has long been implicated in DNA repair, how transcriptional reprogramming is coordinated with the DDR is just beginning to be understood. In this review, we highlight recent advances in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying major transcriptional events, including RNA polymerase (Pol) II stalling and transcriptional silencing and recovery, which occur in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, we discuss how such transcriptional adaptation contributes to sensing and eliminating damaged DNA and how it can jeopardize genome integrity when it goes awry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prolonged hypernutrition impairs TREM2-dependent efferocytosis to license chronic liver inflammation and NASH development</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36521495/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TREM2-dependent macrophage efferocytosis maintains immune homeostasis in the fatty liver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hepatocyte-derived S1P upregulates TREM2 in infiltrated liver macrophages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent obesity causes TREM2 shedding via TNF and IL-1Î²-induced proteolytic cleavage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of TREM2 disables efferocytosis to license chronic liver inflammation and NASH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity-induced chronic liver inflammation is a hallmark of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)âan aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, it remains unclear how such a low-grade, yet persistent, inflammation is sustained in the liver. Here, we show that the macrophage phagocytic receptor TREM2, induced by hepatocyte-derived sphingosine-1-phosphate, was required for efferocytosis of lipid-laden apoptotic hepatocytes and thereby maintained liver immune homeostasis. However, prolonged hypernutrition led to the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1Î² in the liver to induce TREM2 shedding through ADAM17-dependent proteolytic cleavage. Loss of TREM2 resulted in aberrant accumulation of dying hepatocytes, thereby further augmenting proinflammatory cytokine production. This ultimately precipitated a vicious cycle that licensed chronic inflammation to drive simple steatosis transition to NASH. Therefore, impaired macrophage efferocytosis is a previously unrecognized key pathogenic event that enables chronic liver inflammation in obesity. Blocking TREM2 cleavage to restore efferocytosis may represent an effective strategy to treat NASH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cerium oxide-based nanozyme suppresses kidney calcium oxalate crystal depositions via reversing hyperoxaluria-induced oxidative stress damage</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36482378/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress damage to renal epithelial cells is the main pathological factor of calcium oxalate calculi formation. The development of medicine that could alleviate oxidative damage has become the key to the prevention and treatment of urolithiasis. Herein, porous nanorods CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (CNPs) were selected from CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with different morphologies as an antioxidant reagent to suppress kidney calcium oxalate crystal depositions with excellent oxidation resistance due to its larger specific surface area. The reversible transformation from Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; could catalyze the decomposition of excess free radicals and act as a biological antioxidant enzyme basing on its strong ability to scavenge free radicals. The protection capability of CNP&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; against oxalate-induced damage and the effect of CNP&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; on calcium oxalate crystallization were studied. CNP&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; could effectively reduce reactive oxygen species production, restore mitochondrial membrane potential polarity, recover cell cycle progression, reduce cell death, and inhibit the formation of calcium oxalate crystals on the cell surface in vitro. The results of high-throughput sequencing of mRNA showed that CNPs could protect renal epithelial cells from oxidative stress damage caused by high oxalate by suppressing the expression gene of cell surface adhesion proteins. In addition, CNP&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; can significantly reduce the pathological damage of renal tubules and inhibit the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in rat kidneys while having no significant side effect on other organs and physiological indicators in vivo. Our results provide a new strategy for CNP&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; as a potential for clinical prevention of crystalline kidney injury and crystal deposition.

      <title>Ventilator-induced Lung Injury Is Modulated by the Circadian Clock</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36480958/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/36480958/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Mechanical ventilation is life-saving but may evoke ventilator-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; To explore how the circadian clock modulates severity of murine ventilator-induced lung injury via the core clock component BMAL1 in myeloid cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Myeloid cell BMAL1-deficient (&lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) or wild type control (&lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1+/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice were subjected to 4 hours mechanical ventilation (34 mL/kg bodyweight) to induce lung injury. Ventilation was initiated at dawn or dusk, or in complete darkness (circadian time 0 or 12) to determine diurnal and circadian effects. Lung injury was quantified by lung function, pulmonary permeability, blood gas analysis, neutrophil recruitment, inflammatory markers and histology. Neutrophil activation and oxidative burst were analyzed ex vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and main results:&lt;/em&gt; In diurnal experiments, mice ventilated at dawn exhibited higher permeability and neutrophil recruitment compared to dusk. Experiments at circadian time showed deterioration of pulmonary function, worsening of oxygenation and increased mortality at circadian time 0 compared to circadian time 12. Wild type neutrophils isolated at dawn showed higher activation and ROS production compared to dusk, while these day-night differences were dampened in &lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; neutrophils. In &lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, circadian variations in VILI severity were dampened and VILI-induced mortality at circadian time 0 was reduced compared with &lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1+/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammatory response and lung barrier dysfunction upon mechanical ventilation exhibit diurnal variations, regulated by the circadian clock. &lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice are less susceptible to ventilation-induced pathology and lack circadian variation of severity compared with &lt;em&gt;LysM&lt;sup&gt;Bmal1+/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Our data suggest that the internal clock in myeloid cells is an important modulator of ventilator-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Common mechanisms in pediatric acute liver failure</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36496278/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;n 2022 an epidemic of acute hepatitis causing ALF, which affected children aged &amp;lt;5 years, has drawn attention to the lack of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of ALF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most children with ALF during this epidemic were positive for human adenovirus and adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), neither of which is typically linked to ALF in immunocompetent children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children with mutations in genes that form part of the ISR (e.g., PERK) can develop ALF in response to non-hepatotropic viruses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activity in the innate immune system is potentiated by factors derived from the intestinal microbiome and is dependent on Myc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulation of p53 activity is important for determining the balance of hepatocyte senescence and therefore the ability to regenerate during ALF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but potentially fatal disease in children. The etiology is multifactorial, including infection, autoimmune, and genetic disorders, as well as indeterminate hepatitis, which has a higher requirement for liver transplantation. Activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems leads to hepatocyte-specific injury which is mitigated by T regulatory cell activation. Recovery of the native liver depends on activation of apoptotic and regenerative pathways, including the integrated stress response (ISR; e.g., PERK), p53, and HNF4Î±. Loss-of-function mutations in these pathways cause recurrent ALF in response to non-hepatotropic viruses. Deeper understanding of these mechanisms will lead to improved diagnosis, management, and outcomes for pediatric ALF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened small molecules to identify two compounds, which we named RSL3 and RSL5, that have increased lethality in the presence of oncogenic RAS. Counter screening with biologically active compounds defined aspects of the mechanism of action for RSL3 and RSL5, such as a nonapoptotic, MEK-dependent, and iron-dependent oxidative cell death. Erastin, a previously reported compound with RAS-selective lethality, showed similar properties. RNA interference experiments targeting voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (VDAC3), a target of erastin, demonstrated that RSL5 is a scaffold that acts through VDACs to activate the observed pathway. RSL3 activated a similar death mechanism but in a VDAC-independent manner. We found that cells transformed with oncogenic RAS have increased iron content relative to their normal cell counterparts through upregulation of transferrin receptor 1 and downregulation of ferritin heavy chain 1 and ferritin light chain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery of a pyrano[2,3-b]pyridine derivative YX-2102 as a cannabinoid receptor 2 agonist for alleviating lung fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36474298/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pharmacological modulation of cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) is a promising therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Thus, to develop CB2R selective ligands with new chemical space has attracted much research interests. This work aims to discover a novel CB2R agonist from an in-house library, and to evaluate its therapeutic effects on PF model, as well as to disclose the pharmacological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Virtual screening was used to identify the candidate ligand for CB2R from a newly established in-house library. Both in vivo experiments on PF rat model and in vitro experiments on cells were performed to investigate the therapeutic effects of the lead compound and underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A &amp;ldquo;natural product-like&amp;rdquo; pyrano[2,3-b]pyridine derivative, YX-2102 was identified that bound to CB2R with high affinity. Intraperitoneal YX-2102 injections significantly ameliorated lung injury, inflammation and fibrosis in a rat model of PF induced by bleomycin (BLM). On one hand, YX-2102 inhibited inflammatory response at least partially through modulating macrophages polarization thereby exerting protective effects. Whereas, on the other hand, YX-2102 significantly upregulated CB2R expression in alveolar epithelial cells in vivo. Its pretreatment inhibited lung alveolar epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and PF model induced by transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-Î²1) via a CB2 receptor-dependent pathway. Further studies suggested that the Nrf2-Smad7 pathway might be involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These findings suggest that CB2R is a potential target for PF treatment and YX-2102 is a promising CB2R agonist with new chemical space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Necroptosis signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome cross-talking in epithelium facilitate Pseudomonas aeruginosa mediated lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36470578/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, although there is an amount of research just focus on ALI/ ARDS pathophysiological analysis, the development of therapies based on specific molecular targets are still lacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-talking between necroptosis and inflammasome in epithelium promotes pathological damage of ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROS inhibitor Mito-TEMPO blocks inflammasome to alleviate inflammation of ALI, which could be a potential therapeutic target for acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced acute lung injury is such a serious risk to public health, but the pathological regulation remains unclear. Here, we reported that PA mediated epithelial necroptosis plays an important role in pathological process. Pharmacological and genomic ablation of necroptosis signaling ameliorate PA mediated ALI and pulmonary inflammation. Our results further proved NLRP3 inflammasome to involve in the process. Mechanism investigation revealed the cross-talking between inflammasome activation and necroptosis that MLKL-dependent necroptosis signaling promotes the change of mitochondrial membrane potential for the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is the important trigger for functional inflammasome activation. Furthermore, antioxidants such as Mito-TEMPO was confirmed to significantly restrain inflammasome activation in epithelium, resulting in a reduction in PA induced pulmonary inflammation. Taken together, our findings revealed that necroptosis-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome in epithelium plays a crucial role in PA mediated injury, which could be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protection of adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells during acute lung injury requires autophagy maintained by mTOR</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36470863/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells may represent a promising cellular therapy for acute lung injury (ALI); however, the underlying relevant molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) were isolated and characterized by alizarin red staining, oil red staining, and flow cytometry. Lung injury and inflammatory cell infiltration were determined using the Evans blue method, wet/dry weight ratio, and H&amp;amp;E staining. An ELISA was used to detect the concentrations of IFN-Î³, IL-2, and TNF-Î±. Autophagy was detected with an mRFP-GFP-LC3 dual-fluorescence autophagy indicator system, Western blotting, and electron microscopy. We first demonstrated that ADSCs did alleviate the inflammatory responses and tissue damage in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Next, we further demonstrated in vivo that autophagy plays a key role in the maintenance of ADSC therapeutic efficacy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ADSCs co-cultured with alveolar epithelial cells depend on autophagy for significant anti-inflammatory functions. Moreover, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of autophagy. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of ADSC on ALI, especially on alveolar epithelial cells, is dependent on mTOR-mediated autophagy maintenance. The significance of our study for ALI therapy is discussed with respect to a more complete understanding of the therapeutic strategy paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sacubitril/valsartan alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting GSDMD-dependent macrophage pyroptosis in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36471663/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disorder with intricate pathogenesis. Macrophage pyroptosis reportedly plays a vital role in ALI. Although it has been established that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can reduce sepsis-induced organ injury, the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan (SV) for sepsis has been largely understudied. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of SV in sepsis-induced ALI. Caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) were used to induce polymicrobial sepsis and related ALI. The therapeutic effects of SV in CLP mice were subsequently assessed. Gasdermin D (GSDMD)&lt;sup&gt;â/â&lt;/sup&gt; mice were used to validate the signalling pathways affected by SV. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and Raw264.7 cells were treated with SV following exposure to lipopolysaccharide and adenosine triphosphate. Finally, the serum obtained from 42 septic patients was used for biochemical analysis. Compared to the other ARBs, SV yielded more pronounced anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, SV decreased mortality rates, significantly reduced lung damage and prevented the inflammatory response in CLP mice. In addition, SV suppressed GSDMD-mediated macrophage pyroptosis in mice. In BMDMs and Raw264.7 cells, the anti-inflammatory and anti-pyroptosis properties of SV were verified. SV treatment effectively inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and prevented macrophage pyroptosis in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that septic individuals had considerably higher serum angiotensin II levels. Overall, we found that SV might prevent ALI in CLP mice by inhibiting GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis of macrophages. Thus, SV might be a viable drug for sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of cannabinoid-2 receptor protects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced acute lung injury and inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463179/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Bacterial pneumonia is a major risk factor for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; (PA), an opportunistic pathogen with an increasing resistance acquired against multiple drugs, is one of the main causative agents of ALI and ARDS in diverse clinical settings. Given the anti-inflammatory role of the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2R), the effect of CB2R activation in the regulation of PA-induced ALI and inflammation was tested in a mouse model as an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In order to activate CB2R, a selective synthetic agonist, JWH133, was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, SR144528 (a selective CB2R antagonist) was administered in combination with JWH133 to test the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effect. PA was administered intratracheally (i.t.) for induction of pneumonia in mice. At 24 h after PA exposure, lung mechanics were measured using the FlexiVent system. The total cell number, protein content, and neutrophil population in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. The bacterial load in the whole lung was also measured. Lung injury was evaluated by histological examination and PA-induced inflammation was assessed by measuring the levels of BALF cytokines and chemokines. Neutrophil activation (examined by immunofluorescence and immunoblot) and PA-induced inflammatory signaling (analyzed by immunoblot) were also studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CB2R activation by JWH133 was found to significantly reduce PA-induced ALI and the bacterial burden. CB2R activation also suppressed the PA-induced increase in immune cell infiltration, neutrophil population, and inflammatory cytokines. These effects were abrogated by a CB2R antagonist, SR144528, further confirming the specificity of the CB2R-mediated effects. CB2R-knock out (CB2RKO) mice had a significantly higher level of PA-induced inflammation as compared to that in WT mice. CB2R activation diminished the excess activation of neutrophils, whereas mice lacking CB2R had elevated neutrophil activation. Pharmacological activation of CB2R significantly reduced the PA-induced NF-ÎºB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, whereas CB2KO mice had elevated NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings indicate that CB2R activation ameliorates PA-induced lung injury and inflammation, thus paving the path for new therapeutic avenues against PA pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD44 promotes angiogenesis in myocardial infarction through regulating plasma exosome uptake and further enhancing FGFR2 signaling transduction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463112/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36463112/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since angiogenesis occurs as the pathological process following myocardial infarction to alleviate ischemia, therapeutic angiogenesis has been proposed to be a cardioprotective strategy. CD44 has been implicated in endothelial cell functions and its role has been well established in angiogenesis for years. Although recent studies indicate the close correlation between CD44 and exosome, as well as the two being implicated in myocardial ischemia pathological processes, the effect and the underlying mechanism of CD44 and its regulated plasma exosome in pathological angiogenesis post-myocardial infarction have not been fully elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we used CD44 knockout mice to study the in vivo impacts of CD44 on ischemic angiogenesis in myocardial infarction. Mouse cardiac function was measured by echocardiography, histological changes were observed by Evans Blue and TTC-double staining and Massonâs trichrome staining, and molecular changes were detected by immunofluorescence. In the in vitro study, CD44 knockout HUVECs were generated and CD44 inhibitor was used to study the mechanism of CD44 on angiogenesis. We performed the immunoprecipitation, proximity ligation assay, and super-resolution imaging to study the mechanistic regulation of FGFR2 signaling transduction by CD44. Importantly, we also isolated plasma exosomes from myocardial infarction model mice and studied the effect of plasma exosomes on the activation of the FGFR2 signaling pathway and the related phenotypic alterations, including exosomes uptake and angiogenic function in primary mouse microvascular endothelial cells, and further discovered the regulation mechanism of exosomal miRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed that the expression of CD44 in the border zone of the infarcted heart was tightly related to pathological angiogenesis following myocardial ischemia. The depletion of CD44 impaired angiogenesis and impacts biogenesis and proangiogenic function of plasma exosomes. Subsequently, we found that CD44 mediated the activation of the FGFR2 signaling pathway as well as the caveolin 1-dependent uptake of exosomes in vascular endothelial cells. Most importantly, the proangiogenic therapeutic effect of plasma exosomal miRNAs depended upon the participation of CD44/FGFR2 signaling transduction in vascular endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD44 and its regulated plasma exosomes have crucial potent angiogenic activity. Our studies elucidate that CD44 plays a key role in plasma exosomal miRNA-enhanced angiogenic FGFR2 singling transduction and ischemic angiogenesis in the early stage of myocardial infarction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JMJD3 Is Required for Acute Pancreatitis and Pancreatitis-Associated Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36458991/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be complicated by inflammatory disorders of remote organs, such as lung injury, in which Jumonji domain-containing protein 3 (JMJD3) plays a vital role in proinflammatory responses. Currently, we found that JMJD3 expression was upregulated in the pancreas and lung in an AP male mouse model, which was also confirmed in AP patients. Further experiments revealed that the upregulation of JMJD3 and proinflammatory effects were possibly exerted by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or oxidized-mtDNA from tissue injury caused by AP. The release of mtDNA and oxidized-mtDNA contributed to the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes in lung injury through the stimulator of IFN genes (STING)/TLR9-NF-ÎºB-JMJD3-TNF-Î± pathway. The inhibition of JMJD3 or utilization of Jmjd3-cKO mice significantly alleviated pulmonary inflammation induced by AP. Blocking mtDNA oxidation or knocking down the TLR9/STING pathway effectively alleviated inflammation. Therefore, inhibition of JMJD3 or STING/TLR9 pathway blockage might be a potential therapeutic strategy to treat AP and the associated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>H3K27 tri-demethylase JMJD3 inhibits macrophage apoptosis by promoting ADORA2A in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36456564/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common critical disease, which is characterized by an uncontrolled, acute inflammatory response, diffuse lung damage and ultimately directly deteriorates into acute respiratory distress syndrome. The number of pro-inflammatory macrophages is related to the severity of ALI. Up-regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophage apoptosis can reduce the pro-inflammatory reactions. Jumonji domain-containing protein D3 (JMJD3)-mediated histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) demethylation may promote the pro-inflammatory response of macrophages under LPS stimulation. However, the mechanism of JMJD3 affecting macrophage apoptosis is still not clear. To explore this gap in knowledge, the ALI mice model with intratracheal administration of LPS and RAW264.7 cells with LPS stimulation were used as in vivo and in vitro experiments. The expression of JMJD3 and H3K27me3 and their cellular localization were analysed in lung tissue. Apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL staining and flow cytometry. Expression of H3K27me3, ADORA2A and C/EBPÎ² were compared among different treatments and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to investigate the regulatory relationship. Our study showed that JMJD3 expression was upregulated in LPS-induced ALI mice and RAW264.7 cells. JMJD3-indued H3K27me3 demethylation inhibited caspase-3 cleavage by upregulating ADORA2A to decrease LPS-stimulated macrophage apoptosis and promoted the inflammatory reaction. This H3K27me3 demethylation also increased C/EBPÎ² expression, which may enhance ADORA2A expression further. Besides, inhibiting ADORA2A can also promote LPS-limited macrophage apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of JMJD3 in vivo and in vitro relieved the inhibition of macrophage apoptosis thus leading to the resolution of the inflammation. JMJD3 might inhibit macrophage apoptosis by promoting ADORA2A expression in LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common severe complications among hospitalized patients. In the absence of specific drugs to treat AKI, hemodialysis remains the primary clinical treatment for AKI patients. AKI treatment has received significant attention recently due to the excellent drug delivery capabilities of low-dimensional nanomaterials (LDNs) and their unique therapeutic effects. Diverse LDNs have been proposed to treat AKI, with promising results and the potential for future clinical application. This article aims to provide an overview of the pathogenesis of AKI and the recent advances in the treatment of AKI using different types of LDNs. In addition, it is intended to provide theoretical support for the design of LDNs and implications for AKI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cannabinoid Receptor 2-Centric Molecular Feedback Loop Drives Necroptosis in Diabetic Heart Injuries</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36448459/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Diabetic heart dysfunction is a common complication of diabetes. Cell death is a core event that leads to diabetic heart dysfunction. However, the time sequence of cell death pathways and the precise time to intervene of particular cell death type remain largely unknown in the diabetic heart. This study aims to identify the particular cell death type that is responsible for diabetic heart dysfunction and to propose a promising therapeutic strategy by intervening in the cell death pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Type 2 diabetes models were established using db/db leptin receptor-deficient mice and high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced mice. The type 1 diabetes model was established in streptozotocin-induced mice. Apoptosis and programmed cell necrosis (necroptosis) were detected in diabetic mouse hearts at different ages. G protein-coupled receptor-targeted drug library was searched to identify potential receptors regulating the key cell death pathway. Pharmacological and genetic approaches that modulate the expression of targets were used. Stable cell lines and a homemade phosphorylation antibody were prepared to conduct mechanistic studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Necroptosis was activated after apoptosis at later stages of diabetes and was functionally responsible for cardiac dysfunction. Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) was a key regulator of necroptosis. Mechanically, during normal glucose levels, CB2R inhibited S6 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of BACH2 at serine 520, thereby leading to BACH2 translocation to the nucleus, where BACH2 transcriptionally repressed the necroptosis genes Rip1, Rip3, and Mlkl. Under hyperglycemic conditions, high glucose induced CB2R internalization in a Î²-arrestin 2-dependent manner; thereafter, MLKL (mixed lineage kinase domain-like), but not receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 or 3, phosphorylated CB2R at serine 352 and promoted CB2R degradation by ubiquitin modification. Cardiac re-expression of CB2R rescued diabetes-induced cardiomyocyte necroptosis and heart dysfunction, whereas cardiac knockout of Bach2 diminished CB2R-mediated beneficial effects. In human diabetic hearts, both CB2R and BACH2 were negatively associated with diabetes-induced myocardial injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; CB2R transcriptionally repressed necroptosis through interaction with BACH2; in turn, MLKL formed a negative feedback to phosphorylate CB2R. Our study provides the integrative view of a novel molecular mechanism loop for regulation of necroptosis centered by CB2R, which represents a promising alternative strategy for controlling diabetic heart dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FFAR4 improves the senescence of tubular epithelial cells by AMPK/SirT3 signaling in acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36450712/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious clinical complication with high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite substantial progress in understanding the mechanism of AKI, no effective therapy is available for treatment or prevention. We previously found that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family member free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4) agonist TUG891 alleviated kidney dysfunction and tubular injury in AKI mice. However, the versatile role of FFAR4 in kidney has not been well characterized. In the study, the expression of FFAR4 was abnormally decreased in tubular epithelial cells (TECs) of cisplatin, cecal ligation/perforation and ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced AKI mice, respectively. Systemic and conditional TEC-specific knockout of FFAR4 aggravated renal function and pathological damage, whereas FFAR4 activation by TUG-891 alleviated the severity of disease in cisplatin-induced AKI mice. Notably, FFAR4, as a key determinant, was firstly explored to regulate cellular senescence both in injured kidneys of AKI mice and TECs, which was indicated by senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase (SA-Î²-gal) activity, marker protein p53, p21, Lamin B1, phospho-histone H2A.X, phospho-Rb expression, and secretory phenotype IL-6 level. Mechanistically, pharmacological activation and overexpression of FFAR4 reversed the decrease of aging-related SirT3 protein, where FFAR4 regulated SirT3 expression to exhibit anti-senescent effect via Gq subunit-mediated CaMKKÎ²/AMPK signaling in cisplatin-induced mice and TECs. These findings highlight the original role of tubular FFAR4 in cellular senescence via AMPK/SirT3 signaling and identify FFAR4 as a potential drug target against AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFIH1/IRF1/STAT1 promotes sepsis associated inflammatory lung injury via activating macrophage M1 polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36462334/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36462334/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIH1 is activated by infection, which triggers the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor IRF1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRF1 then attaches to the STAT1 promoter region to initiate the transcription of STAT1 and polarization of macrophage M1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRF1 has been identified as the essential molecule that controls the macrophage M1 polarization and the onset of septic ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research has shown that the phenotypic change in macrophages from M0 to M1 is essential for the start of the inflammatory process in septic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Potential treatment targets might be identified with more knowledge of the molecular regulation of M1 macrophages in septic ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-microarray interrelated analysis of high-throughput experiments from ARDS patients and macrophage polarization was conducted to identify the hub genes associated with macrophage M1 polarization and septic ARDS. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Poly (I:C) were utilized to stimulate bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) for M1-polarized macrophage model construction. Knock down of the hub genes on BMDMs via shRNAs was used to screen the genes regulating macrophage M1 polarization in vitro. The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model was constructed in knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice to explore whether the screened genes regulate macrophage M1 polarization in septic ARDS in vivo. ChIP-seq and further experiments on BMDMs were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bioinformatics analysis of gene expression profiles from a clinical cohort of 26 ARDS patients and macrophage polarization found that the 5 hub genes (IFIH1, IRF1, STAT1, IFIT3, GBP1) may have a synergistic effect on macrophage M1 polarization in septic ARDS. Further in vivo investigations indicated that IFIH1, STAT1 and IRF1 contribute to macrophage M1 polarization. The histological evaluation and immunohistochemistry of the lungs from the IRF1-/- and WT mice indicated that knockout of IRF1 markedly alleviated CLP-induced lung injury and M1-polarized infiltration. Moreover, the molecular mechanism investigations indicated that knockdown of IFIH1 markedly promoted IRF1 translocation into the nucleus. Knockout of IRF1 significantly decreases the expression of STAT1. ChIP-seq and PCR further confirmed that IRF1, as a transcription factor of STAT1, binds to the promoter region of STAT1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRF1 was identified as the key molecule that regulates macrophage M1polarization and septic ARDS development in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, as the adaptor in response to infection mimics irritants, IFIH1 promotes IRF1 (transcription factor) translocation into the nucleus to initiate STAT1 transcription.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chlorine (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas is a toxic industrial chemical (TIC) that poses a hazard to human health following accidental and/or intentional (e.g. terrorist) release. By using a murine model of sub-lethal Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposure we have examined the airway hyper responsiveness, cellular infiltrates, transcriptomic and proteomic responses of the lung. In the âcrisisâ phase at 2 h and 6 h there is a significant decreases in leukocytes within bronchoalveolar lavage fluid accompanied by an upregulation within the proteome of immune pathways ultimately resulting in neutrophil influx at 24 h. A flip towards ârepairâ in the transcriptome and proteome occurs at 24 h, neutrophil influx and an associated drop in the lung function persisting until 14 d post-exposure and subsequent ârecoveryâ after 28 days. Collectively, this research provides new insights into the mechanisms of damage, early global responses and processes of repair induced in the lung following the inhalation of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhaled platelet vesicle-decoyed biomimetic nanoparticles attenuate inflammatory lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory response which causes serious damages to alveolar epithelia and vasculature, and it still remains high lethality and mortality with no effective treatment. Based on the inflammatory homing of platelets and cell membrane cloaking nanotechnology, in this study we developed a biomimetic anti-inflammation nanoparticle delivery system for ALI treatment. PM@Cur-RV NPs were designed by combining the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (NPs) coated with platelet membrane vesicles (PM) for the purpose of highly targeting delivery of curcumin (Cur) and resveratrol (RV) to inflammatory lungs. PM@Cur-RV NPs showed good biocompatibility and biosafety both in vitro and in vivo. Accumulation of NPs into lung tract was observed after inhaled NPs. Remarkably, the inhalation of PM@Cur-RV NPs effectively inhibited lung vascular injury evidenced by the decreased lung vascular permeability, and the reduced proinflammatory cytokine burden in an ALI mouse model. The analysis of infiltrated macrophages in the lungs showed that the Cur-RV-modulated macrophage polarized towards M2 phenotype and the decreased histone lactylation might contribute to their anti-inflammation effects. Together, this work highlights the potential of inhalation of biomimetic nanoparticle delivery of curcumin and resveratrol for the treatment of pulmonary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-199a-3p-regulated alveolar macrophage-derived secretory autophagosomes exacerbate lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36523634/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a prevalent illness in intensive care units. Extracellular vesicles and particles released from activated alveolar macrophages (AMs) assist in ARDS lung injury and the inflammatory process through mechanisms that are unclear. This study investigated the role of AM-derived secretory autophagosomes (SAPs) in lung injury and microRNA (MiR)-199a-3p-regulated inflammation associated with ARDS in vitro and in a murine model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The ARDS model in mouse was established by intratracheal LPS lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. The agomirs or antagomirs of MiR-199a-3p were injected into the caudal vein to figure out whether MiR-199a-3p could influence ARDS inflammation and lung injury, whereas the mimics or inhibitors of MiR-199a-3p, siRNA of Rab8a, or PAK4 inhibitor were transfected or applied to RAW264.7 cells to evaluate the mechanism of SAP release. Culture supernatants of RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice were collected for the isolation of SAPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that MiR-199a-3p was over-expressed in the lungs of ARDS mice. The MiR-199a-3p antagomir alleviated, whereas the MiR-199a-3p agomir exacerbated LPS-induced inflammation in mice by promoting AM-derived SAP secretion. In addition, MiR-199a-3p over-expression exacerbated LPS-induced ARDS via activating Rab8a, and Rab8a silencing significantly suppressed the promoting influence of the MiR-199a-3p mimic on SAP secretion. Furthermore, MiR-199a-3p mimic activated Rab8a by directly inhibiting PAK4 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The novel finding of this study is that MiR-199a-3p participated in the regulation of SAP secretion and the inflammatory process via targeting of PAK4/Rab8a, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for ARDS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amorphous silica nanoparticles caused lung injury through the induction of epithelial apoptosis via ROS/Ca2&#43;/DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36441139/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adverse effects of amorphous silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) exposure on the respiratory system were increasingly recognized, however, its potential pathogenesis still remains not fully elucidated. So, this study aimed to explore its effects on pulmonary injury, and to investigate related mechanisms. Histological investigations illustrated SiNPs triggered the lung injury, mainly manifested as alveolar structure destruction, collagen deposition, and mitochondrial ultrastructural injury. In particular, SiNPs greatly enhanced pulmonary ROS and TUNEL positive rate in lungs, both of which were positively correlated with lung impairments. Further, the underlying mechanisms were investigated in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). Consistent with the &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; findings, SiNPs caused the impairments on mitochondrial structure, as well as the activation of ROS generation and oxidative injury. Upon SiNPs stimuli, mitochondrial respiration was greatly inhibited, while Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload in cytosol and mitochondria owing to ER calcium release was noticed, resulting in mitochondrial-dependent epithelial apoptosis. More importantly, mitochondrial dynamics was imbalanced toward a fission type, as evidenced by upregulated DRP1 and its phosphorylation at Ser616 (DRP1&lt;sup&gt;s616&lt;/sup&gt;), while downregulated DRP1&lt;sup&gt;s637&lt;/sup&gt;, and also MFN1, MFN2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the activation of ROS/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling promoted DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission by SiNPs, forming a vicious cycle, and ultimately contributing to apoptosis in 16HBE. In summary, our results disclosed SiNPs caused pulmonary injury through the induction of epithelial apoptosis via a ROS/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chromatin accessibility dynamics dictate renal tubular epithelial cell response to injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) can initiate an adaptive response to completely recover from mild acute kidney injury (AKI), whereas severe injury often leads to persistence of maladaptive repair and progression to kidney fibrosis. Through profiling of active DNA regulatory elements by ATAC-seq, we reveal widespread, dynamic changes in the chromatin accessibility of TECs after ischemiaâreperfusion injury. We show that injury-specific domains of regulatory chromatin become accessible prior to gene activation, creating poised chromatin states to activate the consequent gene expression program and injury response. We further identify RXRÎ± as a key transcription factor in promoting adaptive repair. Activation of RXRÎ± by bexarotene, an FDA-approved RXRÎ± agonist, restores the chromatin state and gene expression program to protect TECs against severe kidney injury. Together, our findings elucidate a chromatin-mediated mechanism underlying differential responses of TECs to varying injuries and identify RXRÎ± as a therapeutic target of acute kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial citrate accumulation drives alveolar epithelial cell necroptosis in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36443565/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necroptosis is the major cause of death in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) during acute lung injury (ALI). Here, we report a previously unrecognized mechanism for necroptosis. We found an accumulation of mitochondrial citrate (citratemt) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated AECs because of the downregulation of Idh3Î± and citrate carrier (CIC, also known as Slc25a1). shRNA- or inhibitor-mediated inhibition of Idh3Î± and Slc25a1 induced citratemt accumulation and necroptosis in vitro. Mice with AEC-specific Idh3Î± and Slc25a1 deficiency exhibited exacerbated lung injury and AEC necroptosis. Interestingly, the overexpression of Idh3Î± and Slc25a1 decreased citratemt levels and rescued AECs from necroptosis. Mechanistically, citratemt accumulation induced mitochondrial fission and excessive mitophagy in AECs. Furthermore, citratemt directly interacted with FUN14 domain-containing protein 1 (FUNDC1) and promoted the interaction of FUNDC1 with dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), leading to excessive mitophagy-mediated necroptosis and thereby initiating and promoting ALI. Importantly, necroptosis induced by citratemt accumulation was inhibited in FUNDC1-knockout AECs. We show that citratemt accumulation is a novel target for protection against ALI involving necroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attenuation of the Severity of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by Pomiferin through Blocking Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in an AKT/Foxo1 Pathway-Dependent Manner</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) gives rise to uncontrolled inflammatory response and oxidative stress, causing very high mortality globally. Pomiferin is a kind of prenylated isoflavonoid extracted from &lt;em&gt;Maclura pomifera&lt;/em&gt;, owning anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the functions and possible mechanisms of pomiferin in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ARDS remain unknown. C57BL/6 mice were injected with LPS (5 mg/kg) intratracheally to induce an in vivo ARDS model while RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) to induce an in vitro model. Our data demonstrated that pomiferin (20 mg/kg) significantly improved pulmonary function and lung pathological injury in mice with ARDS, apart from increasing survival rate. Meanwhile, pomiferin treatment also inhibited LPS-induced inflammation as well as oxidative stress in lung tissues. LPS stimulation significantly activated AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway in lung tissues, which could be reversed after pomiferin treatment. In vitro experiments further showed that 10, 20, and 50 Î¼M of pomiferin could enhance cell viability of RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with LPS. What is more, 3-deoxysappanchalcone (3-DE), one AKT agonist, was used to active AKT in RAW264.7 macrophages. The results further showed that 3-DE could abolish pomiferin-elicited protection in LPS-treated RAW264.7 macrophages, evidenced by activated inflammation and oxidative stress. Taken together, our study showed that pomiferin could exert an ARDS-protective effect by blocking the AKT/Foxo1 signal pathway to inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative injury, which may serve as a potential candidate for the treatment of ARDS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine is a biomarker and potential therapeutic target for community-acquired pneumonia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lysophosphatidylcholine decreases in CAP patients during the acute phase of the disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPC14:0 demonstrates excellent diagnostic performance in predicting CAP disease severity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPC14:0 exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects in vivo and in vitro experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no gold standard for evaluating the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and it is still based on a score. This study aimed to use the metabolomics method to find promised biomarkers in assessing disease severity and potential therapeutic targets for CAP. The result found that the metabolites in the plasma samples of CAP patients had significantly different between the acute phase and the remission phase, especially lysophosphatidylcholine (LPCs) in glycerophospholipids, whose levels are negatively linked to the severity of the disease. Subsequently, the two key metabolites of myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC 14:0) and LPC 16:1 were screened. We analyzed the predictive performance of the two metabolites using Spearman-related analysis and ROC curves, and LPC14:0 showed more satisfactory diagnostic performance than LPC16:1. Then we explored the protective role and mechanism of LPC 14:0 in animal and cell models. The results showed that LPC 14:0 could inhibit the LPS-induced secretion of IL-1Î², IL-6, and TNF-Î±, lower the ROS and MDA levels, and decreased the depletion of SOD and GSH, thereby reducing lung tissue and cell damage, such as down-regulating the protein level in BALF, lung W/D ratio, MPO activity, and apoptosis. We found that LPC 14:0 inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress, and the above protection was achieved by inhibiting LPS-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. LPC 14:0 may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting the severity of CAP. In addition, our exploration of the role of LPC 14:0 in animal and cellular models has reinforced its promise as a therapeutic target to improve the clinical efficacy for CAP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPS-induced alveolar macrophage inflammation and alveolar epithelial cell death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIT1 could relieve LPS-induced acute lung injury model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIT1 decreased TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² and IL-6 expression in MH-S cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFIT1 suppressed MLE-12 cell apoptosis induced by MH-S cell supernatant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is featured by intensive inflammatory responses causing significant morbidity and mortality. Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), induced by interferon (IFN), has been discovered to modulate viral infection and cell apoptosis and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, itâs role and mechanism in ALI remain unclear and need to be explored furtherly. Here, we discovered that IFIT1 decreased the expression of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² and IL-6 in mouse-derived macrophage cells (MH-S) and alleviated apoptosis of murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) induced by MH-S cell supernatant, contributing to anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis (RNA-seq) showed that inflammatory chemokine Csingle bondC motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) partially eliminated the protective effects of IFIT1 and promoted the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² and IL-6 by CCL5-p65NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. This study demonstrated that IFIT1 attenuated ALI-associated inflammation and cell apoptosis by regulating the CCL5-p65NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. These findings are of great significance for the treatment of lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sirt3 mitigates LPS-induced mitochondrial damage in renal tubular epithelial cells by deacetylating YME1L1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36433732/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is often secondary to sepsis. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathological process of AKI. In this study, we aimed to examine the regulatory roles of Sirt3 in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mitochondrial damage in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). Sirt3 knockout mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS, and cultured TECs were stimulated with LPS to evaluate the effects of Sirt3 on mitochondrial structure and function in TECs. Electron microscopy was used to assess mitochondrial morphology. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect protein expression and examine mitochondrial morphology. Western blotting was used to quantify protein expression. We observed that LPS increased apoptosis, induced disturbances in mitochondrial function and dynamics, and downregulated Sirt3 expression in a sepsis-induced AKI mouse model and human proximal tubular (HK-2) cells in vitro. Sirt3 deficiency further exacerbated LPS-induced renal pathological damage, apoptosis and disturbances in mitochondrial function and dynamics. On the contrary, Sirt3 overexpression in HK-2 cells alleviated these lesions. Functional studies revealed that Sirt3 overexpression alleviated LPS-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in TECs by promoting OPA1-mediated mitochondrial fusion through the deacetylation of i-AAA protease (YME1L1), an upstream regulatory molecule of OPA1. Our study has identified Sirt3 as a vital factor that protects against LPS-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in TECs via the YME1L1-OPA1 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heme oxygenase-1 ameliorates endotoxin-induced acute lung injury by modulating macrophage polarization via inhibiting TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36436727/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) remains a global public health issue without specific and effective treatment options available in the clinic. Alveolar macrophage polarization is involved in the initiation, development and progression of ALI; however, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) acts as an antioxidant in pulmonary inflammation and has been demonstrated to be linked with the severity and prognosis of ALI. In this study, the therapeutic effects of HO-1 were examined, along with the mechanisms involved, mainly focusing on alveolar macrophage polarization. HO-1 depletion induced higher iNOS and CD86 (M1 phenotype) expression but was significantly decreased in Arg-1 and CD206 (M2 phenotype) expression in BALF alveolar macrophages after equivalent LPS stimulation. We also found that HO-1 deletion distinctly accelerated the expression of inflammasome-associated components NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 in vivo and in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, on the basis of LPS for MH-S cells, levels of TXNIP, NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 were increased and HO-1 depletion exacerbated these changes, whereas double depletion of HO-1 and TXNIP partially mitigated these elevations. Also, HO-1 knockdown induced more M1 phenotype and less M2 phenotype compared with LPS alone, whereas double silence of HO-1 and TXNIP partially changed the polarization state. Taken together, we demonstrated that HO-1 could modulate macrophage polarization via TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway, which could be a potential therapeutic target for ALI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activation of endogenous neurogenesis by bioactive materials enables restoration of sensory/motor function after complete spinal cord injury (SCI) via formation of new relay neural circuits. The underlying wiring logic of newborn neurons in adult central nervous system (CNS) is unknown. Here, we report neurotrophin3-loaded chitosan biomaterial substantially recovered bladder function after SCI. Multiple neuro-circuitry tracing technologies using pseudorabies virus (PRV), rabies virus (RV), and anterograde adeno-associated virus (AAV), demonstrated that newborn neurons were integrated into the micturition neural circuits and reconnected higher brain centers and lower spinal cord centers to control voiding, and participated in the restoration of the lower urinary tract function, even in the absence of long-distance axonal regeneration. Opto- and chemo-genetic studies further supported the notion that the supraspinal control of the lower urinary tract function was partially recovered. Our data demonstrated that regenerated relay neurons could be properly integrated into disrupted long-range neural circuits to restore function of adult CNS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective effect and mechanism of baicalin on lung inflammatory injury in BALB/cJ mice induced by PM2.5</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36442400/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respiratory function impairment caused by PM2.5 exposure could be improved by baicalin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baicalin regulates the composition and diversity of pharyngeal microbiota in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baicalin alleviates the respiratory inflammatory response caused by PM2.5 exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baicalin exerts anti-inflammatory effects by the HMGB1/NLRP3/Casepase1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public health harms caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have become a global focus, with PM2.5 exposure recognized as a critical risk factor for global morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation is the common pathophysiological feature of respiratory diseases induced by PM2.5 and is the most critical cause of all these diseases. However, presently there is a lack of effective preventive and therapeutic approaches for inflammatory lung injuries caused by PM2.5 exposure. Baicalin is a herb-derived effective flavonoid compound with multiple health benefits. This study established a murine lung inflammatory injury model via inhalation of PM2.5 aerosols. The data showed that after baicalin intervention, lung injury pathological score of baicalin (4.16 Â± 0.54, 3.33 Â± 0.76, 4.00 Â± 0.45) and claricid (3.00 Â± 0.78) treatments were markedly lower than PM2.5-treated mice (6.17 Â± 0.31), and pathological damage was alleviated. Compared to the PM2.5 group, the spleen and lung indexes in the baicalin and claricid groups were significantly reduced. The inflammatory cytokines of TNF-Î±, IL-18, and IL-1Î² in serum, alveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissue were significantly decreased in the baicalin and claricid groups. The expressions of inflammatory pathway-related genes and proteins HMGB1, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 were up-regulated in the PM2.5 group. The expressions of these genes and proteins were significantly decreased following baicalin treatment. The lung function indicators showed that the MV (65.94 Â± 8.19 mL), sRaw (1.79 Â± 0.08 cm H2O.s), and FRC (0.52 Â± 0.01 mL) in the PM2.5 group were higher than in the control and baicalin groups, and respiratory function was improved by baicalin. PM2.5 exposure markedly altered the bacterial composition at the genus level. The dominant flora relative abundances of uncultured_bacterium_f_Muribaculaceae, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus, were decreased from the control group (9.20%, 8.53%, 6.21%) to PM2.5 group (6.26%, 5.49%, 4.77%), respectively. Following baicalin intervention, the relative abundances were 9.72%, 6.65%, and 3.57%, respectively. Therefore, baicalin could potentially prevent and improve mice lung inflammatory injury induced by PM2.5 exposure. Baicalin might provide a protective role by balancing oropharyngeal microbiota and affecting the expression of the HMGB1/Caspase1 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endothelial cell injury plays a critical part in ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) and participates in the progression of AKI. Targeting renal endothelial cell therapy may ameliorate vascular injury and further improve the prognosis of ischemic AKI. Here, P-selectin as a biomarker of ischemic AKI in endothelial cells is identified and P-selectin binding peptide (PBP)-engineered extracellular vesicles (PBP-EVs) with imaging and therapeutic functions are developed. The results show that PBP-EVs exhibit a selective targeting tendency to injured kidneys, while providing spatiotemporal information for the early diagnosis of AKI by quantifying the expression of P-selectin in the kidneys by molecular imaging. Meanwhile, PBP-EVs reveal superior nephroprotective functions in the promotion of renal repair and inhibition of fibrosis by alleviating inflammatory infiltration, improving reparative angiogenesis, and ameliorating maladaptive repair of the renal parenchyma. In conclusion, PBP-EVs, as an ischemic AKI theranostic system that is designed in this study, provide a spatiotemporal diagnosis in the early stages of AKI to help guide personalized therapy and exhibit superior nephroprotective effects, offering proof-of-concept data to design EV-based theranostic strategies to promote renal recovery and further improve long-term outcomes following AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1,2,3,4,6-O-Pentagalloylglucose Protects against Acute Lung Injury by Activating the AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 Pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious lung disease with a high mortality rate, warranting the development of novel therapies. Previously, we reported that 1,2,3,4,6-O-pentagalloylglucose (PGG) could afford protection against ALI, however, the PGG-mediated protective effects remain elusive. Herein, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) markedly inhibited the lung wet/drug weight ratio and attenuated histological changes in the lungs (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). A pretreatment with PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) reduced the number of total leukocytes and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1Î² in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, PGG (60 and 30 mg/kg) also attenuated oxidative stress by reducing the formation of formation and the depletion of superoxide dismutase to treat an ALI (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). To further explore the PGG-induced mechanism against an ALI, we screened the PGG pathway using immunohistochemical analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and Western blotting (WB). WB revealed that the expression levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (p-AMPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B phosphorylation (P-Akt), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) were significantly higher in the PGG group (60 and 30 mg/kg) than in the lipopolysaccharide group (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05); these findings were confirmed by the immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence results. Accordingly, PGG could be effective against an ALI by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress via AMPK/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling, allowing for the potential development of this as a natural drug against an ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) show therapeutic potential in multiple disease models, including kidney injury. Clinical translation of sEVs requires further preclinical and regulatory developments, including elucidation of the biodistribution and mode of action (MoA). Biodistribution can be determined using labelled sEVs in animal models which come with ethical concerns, are time-consuming and expensive, and may not well represent human physiology. We hypothesised that, based on developments in microfluidics and human organoid technology, in vitro multi-organ-on-a-chip (MOC) models allow us to study effects of sEVs in modelled human organs like kidney and liver in a semi-systemic manner. Human kidney- and liver organoids combined by microfluidic channels maintained physiological functions, and a kidney injury model was established using hydrogenperoxide. MSC-sEVs were isolated, and their size, density and potential contamination were analysed. These sEVs stimulated recovery of the renal epithelium after injury. Microscopic analysis shows increased accumulation of PKH67-labelled sEVs not only in injured kidney cells, but also in the unharmed liver organoids, compared to healthy control conditions. In conclusion, this new MOC model recapitulates therapeutic efficacy and biodistribution of MSC-sEVs as observed in animal models. Its human background allows for in-depth analysis of the MoA and identification of potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating hyaluronic acid signature in CAP and ARDS - the role of pneumolysin in hyaluronic acid shedding</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36456058/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soluble HA levels are elevated in CAP and ARDS plasma and are associated with an increase in 28-day mortality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soluble HA levels correlate with disease severity and markers of inflammation, endothelial cell activation, and basement membrane destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small and large HA fragments are detected in plasma of most severe CAP or ARDS patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pneumolysin induces HA release from human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pneumolysin-induced HA shedding is dependent on reactive oxygen species production and is not associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shedding of hyaluronan (HA), the component of endothelial cell (EC) glycocalyx, has been associated with acute lung injury. HA degradation allows plasma proteins and fluid to penetrate across the vascular wall leading to lung edema formation and leukocyte recruitment. Here, we analyzed sHA levels and size in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), correlated them to disease severity, and evaluated the impact of pneumolysin (PLY), the Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.p.) exotoxin, on HA shedding from human pulmonary microvascular EC (HPMVEC). sHA levels were elevated in CAP and ARDS and correlated with the CRB65 severity score and with markers of inflammation (interleukin-6), EC activation (E-selectin), and basement membrane destruction (collagen IV). Furthermore, sHA levels were associated with an increase in 28-day mortality. Small and large sHA fragments were detected in plasma of most severe CAP or ARDS patients, and the presence of large sHA fragments was accompanied by the elevated levels of circulating collagen IV. In vitro, PLY induced sHA release from HPMVEC. This effect was dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and was not associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction. Conversely, HA shedding was impaired following HPMVEC infection with a S.p. PLY-deficient mutant. Our study identifies association between the severity of CAP and ARDS and the levels and size of sHA in plasma. It links sHA levels with, inflammation, EC activation status and basement membrane disassembly in ARDS and provides insights into the mechanism of HA shedding during infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lactoferrin Ameliorates Ovalbumin-Induced Asthma in Mice through Reducing Dendritic-Cell-Derived Th2 Cell Responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36430662/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease with symptoms such as expiratory airflow narrowing and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Millions of people suffer from asthma and are at risk of life-threatening conditions. Lactoferrin (LF) is a glycoprotein with multiple physiological functions, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antitumoral activities. LF has been shown to function in immunoregulatory activities in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) in mice. Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of LF in AHR and the functions of dendritic cells (DCs) and Th2-related responses in asthma. Twenty 8-week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into normal control (NC), ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized, and OVA-sensitized with low dose of LF (100 mg/kg) or high dose of LF (300 mg/kg) treatment groups. The mice were challenged by intranasal instillation with 5% OVA on the 21st to 27th day after the start of the sensitization period. The AHR, cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and pulmonary histology of each mouse were measured. Serum OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 and OVA-specific splenocyte responses were further detected. The results showed that LF exhibited protective effects in ameliorating AHR, as well as lung inflammation and damage, in reducing the expression of Th2 cytokines and the secretion of allergen-specific antibodies, in influencing the functions of DCs, and in decreasing the level of Th2 immune responses in a BALB/c mouse model of OVA-induced allergic asthma. Importantly, we demonstrated that LF has practical application in reducing DC-induced Th2 cell responses in asthma. In conclusion, LF exhibits anti-inflammation and immunoregulation activities in OVA-induced allergic asthma. These results suggest that LF may act as a supplement to prevent asthma-induced lung injury and provide an additional agent for reducing asthma severity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of folic acid on oxidative damage of kidney in lead-exposed rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36458173/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Lead (Pb) has many applications in daily life, but in recent years, various problems caused by lead exposure have aroused people&amp;rsquo;s concern. Folic acid is widely found in fruits and has received more attention for its antioxidant function. However, the role of folic acid in lead-induced kidney injury in rats is unclear. This study was designed to investigate the effects of folic acid on oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the kidney of rats caused by lead exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Forty specific pathogen-free male Rattus norvegicus rats were randomly divided into control, lead, intervention, and folic acid groups. The levels of SOD, GSH-Px, GSH, and MDA were measured by biochemical kits. The protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1, CHOP, and GRP78 were measured by immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; This study showed that lead exposure increased the blood levels of lead in mice. However, the intervention of folic acid decreased the levels of lead, but the difference was not statistically significant. Lead exposure causes oxidative stress by decreasing kidney SOD, GSH-Px, and GSH levels and increasing MDA levels. However, folic acid alleviated the oxidative damage caused by lead exposure by increasing the levels of GSH-Px and GSH and decreasing the levels of MDA. Immunofluorescence results showed that folic acid intervention downregulated the upregulation of kidney Nrf2, HO-1, GRP78, and CHOP expression caused by lead exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt; Overall, folic acid alleviates kidney oxidative stress induced by lead exposure by regulating Nrf2 and HO-1, while regulating CHOP and GRP78 to mitigate apoptosis caused by excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Melatonin Suppresses Macrophage M1 Polarization and ROS-Mediated Pyroptosis via Activating ApoE/LDLR Pathway in Influenza A-Induced Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36425057/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza virus infection is one of the strongest pathogenic factors for the development of acute lung injury (ALI)/ acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms have not been clarified. In this study, we aim to investigate whether melatonin modulates macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis via activating Apolipoprotein E/low-density lipoprotein receptor (ApoE/LDLR) pathway in influenza A-induced ALI. Here, wild-type (WT) and ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice were instilled intratracheally with influenza A (H3N2) and injected intraperitoneally with melatonin for 7 consecutive days. In vitro, WT and ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were pretreated with melatonin before H3N2 stimulation. The results showed that melatonin administration significantly attenuated H3N2-induced pulmonary damage, leukocyte infiltration, and edema; decreased the expression of proinflammatory M1 markers; enhanced anti-inflammatory M2 markers; and switched the polarization of alveolar macrophages (AMs) from M1 to M2 phenotype. Additionally, melatonin inhibited reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) mediated pyroptosis shown by downregulation of malonaldehyde (MDA) and ROS levels as well as inhibition of the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Strikingly, the ApoE/LDLR pathway was activated when melatonin was applied in H3N2-infected macrophages and mice. ApoE knockout mostly abrogated the protective impacts of melatonin on H3N2-induced ALI and its regulatory ability on macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis. Furthermore, recombinant ApoE3 (re-ApoE3) inhibited H3N2-induced M1 polarization of BMDMs with upregulation of MT1 and MT2 expression, but re-ApoE2 and re-ApoE4 failed to do this. Melatonin combined with re-ApoE3 played more beneficial protective effects on modulating macrophage polarization, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis in H3N2-infected ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; BMDMs. Our study indicated that melatonin attenuated influenza A- (H3N2-) induced ALI by inhibiting the M1 polarization of pulmonary macrophages and ROS-mediated pyroptosis via activating the ApoE/LDLR pathway. This study suggested that melatonin-ApoE/LDLR axis may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for influenza virus-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astaxanthin ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via inhibition of inflammatory reactions and modulation of the SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36278420/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a systemic inflammatory process. A large number of studies have shown that astaxanthin (ASTA) has strong anti-inflammatory effects and almost non-toxic side effects. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of ASTA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice and its underlying mechanism. The result showed that compared with the LPS group, the expression levels of the respiratory resistance (Re), inspiratory resistance (Ri), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio, albumin (BA/SA) ratio and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the ASTA pretreatment group were significantly reduced, and total cell, neutrophil and macrophage counts were significantly decreased. HE staining results showed that alveolar interstitial edema, bleeding and erythrocyte exudation were reduced. Compared with the LPS group, the percentage of Th17 cells and the content of interleukin (IL)-17 and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) in the ASTA pretreatment group were significantly decreased, while the content of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î² and the percentage of Treg cells were significantly increased. Western blot analysis showed that ASTA could up-regulate the expression level of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) and down-regulate the expression levels of phosphorylated Janus kinase 2 (p-JAK2), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) in lung tissue. The results showed that ASTA had a protective effect on LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, and its protective mechanism was through activating the SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting Treg cell differentiation and reducing inflammatory reactions and Th17 cell differentiation, which provided a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cirsilineol Treatment Attenuates PM2.5-Induced Lung Injury in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36430427/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafine particulate matter with less than 2.5 Î¼m diameter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) is an air pollutant that causes severe lung damage. Currently, effective treatment and preventive methods for PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung damage are limited. Cirsilineol (CSL) is a small natural compound isolated from Artemisia vestita. In this study, the efficacy of CSL on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung toxicity was tested, and its mechanism was identified. Lung injury was caused by intratracheal administration of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; suspension in animal models. Two days after PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; pretreatment, CSL was injected via mouse tail vein for two days. The effects of CSL on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung damage, autophagy, apoptosis, and pulmonary inflammation in a mouse model and their mechanisms were investigated. CSL significantly suppressed histological lung damage and lung wet/dry weight proportion. CSL also significantly reduced PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced autophagy dysfunction, apoptosis, lymphocyte suppression, and inflammatory cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF). Furthermore, CSL increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation and significantly inhibited the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, MyD88, and the autophagy proteins, Beclin1 and LC3II. Thus, CSL exerts protective effects on pulmonary damage by regulating mTOR and TLR2,4âmyD88 autophagy pathways. Therefore, CSL can be used as an effective treatment for PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance: Xuebijing injection is a Chinese herbal-derived drug composed of radix paeoniaerubra, rhizomachuanxiong, Salvia miltiorrhiza, floscarthami, and Angelica sinensis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Xuebijing administration on pulmonary endothelial injury and coagulation dysfunction in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis rat model. Materials and methods: A CLP-induced sepsis rat model was established. The CLP rats were treated with a vehicle or Xuebijing via intravenous infusion and sacrificed at 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 h after CLP for lung tissue and blood sample collection. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was monitored. Transmission microscopy examination and H&amp;amp;E staining were performed to observe pulmonary structural alterations. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the plasma levels of epithelial markers, proinflammatory cytokines, and coagulation-related proteins. Results: Compared with vehicle treatment, Xuebijing administration maintained the MAP in the normal range until 11 h after CLP. Transmission microscopy and H&amp;amp;E staining revealed that Xuebijing administration alleviated alveolarâcapillary barrier impairments and lung inflammation in CLP rats. ELISA showed that Xuebijing administration effectively reversed CLP-induced elevations in the plasma levels of epithelial markers endothelin-1 and von Willebrand factor, starting 6 and 8 h after CLP, respectively. Xuebijing administration also significantly abolished CLP-induced rises in circulating proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) at 6 h after CLP, IL-1Î² at 2 and 12 h after CLP, and TNF-Î± at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after CLP. In addition, Xuebijing administration strongly reversed CLP-induced alterations in circulating active protein C and tissue-type plasminogen activator, starting 4 h and 2 h after CLP, respectively. Conclusions: Xuebijing ameliorates pulmonary endothelial injury, systemic inflammation, and coagulation dysfunction in early sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is becoming a public health problem worldwide. AKI is usually considered a complication of lung, heart, liver, gut, and brain disease, but recent findings have supported that injured kidney can also cause dysfunction of other organs, suggesting organ crosstalk existence in AKI. However, the organ crosstalk in AKI and the underlying mechanisms have not been broadly reviewed or fully investigated. In this review, we summarize recent clinical and laboratory findings of organ crosstalk in AKI and highlight the related molecular mechanisms. Moreover, their crosstalk involves inflammatory and immune responses, hemodynamic change, fluid homeostasis, hormone secretion, nerve reflex regulation, uremic toxin, and oxidative stress. Our review provides important clues for the intervention for AKI and investigates important therapeutic potential from a new perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xuanfei Baidu Formula (XBF) is an effective traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) remedy for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. This herbal medicine has shown effects in reducing clinical symptoms and shortening the average length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that XBF alleviates acute lung injury (ALI) by regulating macrophage-mediated immune inflammation, but the mechanisms of action remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to evaluate the lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of XBF and its underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, XBF&amp;rsquo;s effects were investigated in an ALI mouse model induced by inhalation of atomized lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Besides, the LPS-induced inflammation model in RAW264.7 cells was used to clarify the underlying mechanisms of XBF against ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results showed that XBF treatment alleviated LPS-induced lung injury, as evidenced by reduced histopathological changes, pulmonary alveoli permeability, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the lung tissues. In addition, inflammation was alleviated as shown by decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1Î² in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and reduced white blood cell (WBC) count in BALF. Furthermore, consistent with the in vivo assay, XBF inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines release and pro-inflammatory polarization in RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, XBF increased mitochondrial fusion by upregulating Mfn1 and attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by repressing Casp11, respectively, to inhibit NF-ÎºB and MAPK pathways, thus repressing pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we demonstrate that XBF exerts anti-ALI and -inflammatory effects by recovering mitochondrial dynamics and reducing inflammasome activation, providing a biological illustration of the clinical efficacy of XBF in treating COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beneficial effects of CCL8 inhibition at lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36404927/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CCL8 (MCP-2) is a chemoattractive cytokine associated with various immune-related pathologies. Recent studies show that CCL8 is significantly stimulated during acute respiratory distress syndrome in severely ill patients with COVID-19, making the inhibition of CCL8 activity a promising treatment. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury was evaluated in mice using a neutralizing antibody (1G3E5) against human CCL8. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that following IP administration, 1G3E5 was sustained at higher levels and for a longer period compared to IV administration. CCL8 expression in the lungs was not enhanced by LPS, but CCR2 and CCR5 receptors were significantly stimulated. 1G3E5-mediated inhibition of CCL8 was associated with the reduction of pulmonary inflammation and suppression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results point to a previously unrecognized, permissive role for CCL8 in mediating cytokine induction and ultimately sustaining inflammation. Disruption of CCL8 activity may provide a strategy for mitigating pulmonary inflammation during lung injury when related to abnormal cytokine induction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blocking MG53S255 Phosphorylation Protects Diabetic Heart From Ischemic Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36337049/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; As an integral component of cell membrane repair machinery, MG53 (mitsugumin 53) is important for cardioprotection induced by ischemia preconditioning and postconditioning. However, it also impairs insulin signaling via its E3 ligase activity-mediated ubiquitination-dependent degradation of IR (insulin receptor) and IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) and its myokine function-induced allosteric blockage of IR. Here, we sought to develop MG53 into a cardioprotection therapy by separating its detrimental metabolic effects from beneficial actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, site-specific mutation, in vitro kinase assay, and in vivo animal studies, we investigated the role of MG53 phosphorylation at serine 255 (S255). In particular, utilizing recombinant proteins and gene knock-in approaches, we evaluated the potential therapeutic effect of MG53-S255A mutant in treating cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury in diabetic mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We identified S255 phosphorylation as a prerequisite for MG53 E3 ligase activity. Furthermore, MG53S255 phosphorylation was mediated by GSK3Î² (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) and markedly elevated in the animal models with metabolic disorders. Thus, IR-IRS1-GSK3Î²-MG53 formed a vicious cycle in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders where aberrant insulin signaling led to hyper-activation of GSK3Î², which in turn, phosphorylated MG53 and enhanced its E3 ligase activity, and further impaired insulin sensitivity. Importantly, S255A mutant eliminated the E3 ligase activity while retained cell protective function of MG53. Consequently, the S255A mutant, but not the wild type MG53, protected the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury in db/db mice with advanced diabetes, although both elicited cardioprotection in normal mice. Moreover, in S255A knock-in mice, S255A mutant also mitigated ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial damage in the diabetic setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; S255 phosphorylation is a biased regulation of MG53 E3 ligase activity. The MG53-S255A mutant provides a promising approach for the treatment of acute myocardial injury, especially in patients with metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and Rab GTPases coordinate EGFR trafficking to regulate macrophage activation in sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36344490/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EGFR phosphorylation is required for TLR4-mediated macrophage activation during sepsis. However, whether and how intracellular EGFR is transported during endotoxemia have largely been unknown. Here, we show that LPS promotes high levels cell surface expression of EGFR in macrophages through two different transport mechanisms. On one hand, Rab10 is required for EEA1-mediated the membrane translocation of EGFR from the Golgi. On the other hand, EGFR phosphorylation prevents its endocytosis in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced membrane EGFR expression in LPS-activated macrophage. Mechanistically, upon LPS induced TLR4/EGFR phosphorylation, MAPK14 phosphorylated Rab7a at S72 impaired membrane receptor late endocytosis, which maintains EGFR membrane localization though blocking its lysosomal degradation. Meanwhile, Rab5a is also involved in the early endocytosis of EGFR. Subsequently, inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation switches M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype and alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury. Mechanistic study demonstrated that Erlotinib suppressed glycolysis-dependent M1 polarization via PKM2/HIF-1É pathway and promoted M2 polarization through up-regulating PPARÎ³ induced glutamine metabolism. Collectively, our data elucidated a more in-depth mechanism of macrophages activation, and provided stronger evidence supporting EGFR as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dusp6 deficiency attenuates neutrophil-mediated cardiac damage in the acute inflammatory phase of myocardial infarction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36335128/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) serves a specific and conserved function on the dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). We previously identified Dusp6 as a regenerative repressor during zebrafish heart regeneration, therefore we propose to investigate the role of this repressor in mammalian cardiac repair. Utilizing a rat strain harboring Dusp6 nonsense mutation, rat neutrophil-cardiomyocyte co-culture, bone marrow transplanted rats and neutrophil-specific Dusp6 knockout mice, we find that Dusp6 deficiency improves cardiac outcomes by predominantly attenuating neutrophil-mediated myocardial damage in acute inflammatory phase after myocardial infarction. Mechanistically, Dusp6 is transcriptionally activated by p38-C/EBPÎ² signaling and acts as an effector for maintaining p-p38 activity by down-regulating pERK and p38-targeting phosphatases DUSP1/DUSP16. Our findings provide robust animal models and novel insights for neutrophil-mediated cardiac damage and demonstrate the potential of DUSP6 as a therapeutic target for post-MI cardiac remodeling and other relevant inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GLI1&#43; cells are a source of repair-supportive mesenchymal cells (RSMCs) during airway epithelial regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36333491/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repair-supportive mesenchymal cells (RSMCs) have been recently reported in the context of naphthalene (NA)-induced airway injury and regeneration. These cells transiently express smooth muscle actin (&lt;em&gt;Acta2&lt;/em&gt;) and are enriched with platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (&lt;em&gt;Pdgfra&lt;/em&gt;) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (&lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt;) expression. Genetic deletion of Ctnnb1 (gene coding for beta catenin) or &lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt; in these cells using the &lt;em&gt;Acta2-Cre-ERT2&lt;/em&gt; driver line after injury (defined as NA-Tam condition; Tam refers to tamoxifen) led to impaired repair of the airway epithelium. In this study, we demonstrate that RSMCs are mostly captured using the &lt;em&gt;Acta2-Cre-ERT2&lt;/em&gt; driver when labeling occurs after (NA-Tam condition) rather than before injury (Tam-NA condition), and that their expansion occurs mostly between days 3 and 7 following NA treatment. Previous studies have shown that lineage-traced peribronchial GLI1+ cells are transiently amplified after NA injury. Here, we report that &lt;em&gt;Gli1&lt;/em&gt; expression is enriched in RSMCs. Using lineage tracing with Gli1&lt;sup&gt;Cre-ERT2&lt;/sup&gt; mice combined with genetic inactivation of &lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt;, we show that GLI1+ cells with &lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt; deletion fail to amplify around the injured airways, thus resulting in impaired airway epithelial repair. Interestingly, &lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt; expression is not upregulated in GLI1+ cells following NA treatment, suggesting that epithelial repair is mostly due to the increased number of &lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt;-expressing GLI1+ cells. Co-culture of SCGB1A1+ cells with GLI1+ cells isolated from non-injured or injured lungs showed that GLI1+ cells from these two conditions are similarly capable of supporting bronchiolar organoid (or bronchiolosphere) formation. Single-cell RNA sequencing on sorted lineage-labeled cells showed that the RSMC signature resembles that of alveolar fibroblasts. Altogether, our study provides strong evidence for the involvement of mesenchymal progenitors in airway epithelial regeneration and highlights the critical role played by &lt;em&gt;Fgf10&lt;/em&gt;-expressing GLI1+ cells in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblast growth factor 10 protects against particulate matter-induced lung injury by inhibiting oxidative stress-mediated pyroptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulate matter (PM) is a major environmental contaminant that causes and worsens respiratory diseases. Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10), a paracrine fibroblast growth factor that specifically stimulates repair and regeneration after injury, has been shown to protect against PM-induced lung injury. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, the protective effects of FGF10 were investigated using a PM-induced lung injury mouse model in vivo and BEAS-2B cells in vitro. According to the findings, FGF10 treatment alleviated PM-induced oxidative damage and pyroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, FGF10 activated antioxidative Nrf2 signaling. Inhibition of PI3K signaling with LY294002 or Nrf2 signaling with ML385 revealed that FGF10-mediated lung protection was mediated by the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. These results collectively indicate that FGF10 inhibits oxidative stress-mediated pyroptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway, suggesting a possible therapy for PM-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bacterial polyphosphates induce CXCL4 and synergize with complement anaphylatoxin C5a in lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36405694/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyphosphates are linear polymers of inorganic phosphates that exist in all living cells and serve pleiotropic functions. Bacteria produce long-chain polyphosphates, which can interfere with host defense to infection. In contrast, short-chain polyphosphates are released from platelet dense granules and bind to the chemokine CXCL4. Here, we report that long-chain polyphosphates induced the release of CXCL4 from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages in a dose-/time-dependent fashion resulting from an induction of CXCL4 mRNA. This polyphosphate effect was lost after pre-incubation with recombinant exopolyphosphatase (PPX) Fc fusion protein, demonstrating the potency of long chains over monophosphates and ambient cations. In detail, polyphosphate chains &amp;gt;70 inorganic phosphate residues were required to reliably induce CXCL4. Polyphosphates acted independently of the purinergic P2Y1 receptor and the MyD88/TRIF adaptors of Toll-like receptors. On the other hand, polyphosphates augmented LPS/MyD88-induced CXCL4 release, which was explained by intracellular signaling convergence on PI3K/Akt. Polyphosphates induced Akt phosphorylation at threonine-308. Pharmacologic blockade of PI3K (wortmannin, LY294002) antagonized polyphosphate-induced CXCL4 release from macrophages. Intratracheal polyphosphate administration to C57BL/6J mice caused histologic signs of lung injury, disruption of the endothelial-epithelial barrier, influx of Ly6G&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; polymorphonuclear neutrophils, depletion of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;SiglecF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; alveolar macrophages, and release of CXCL4. Long-chain polyphosphates synergized with the complement anaphylatoxin, C5a, which was partly explained by upregulation of C5aR1 on myeloid cells. C5aR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice were protected from polyphosphate-induced lung injury. C5a generation occurred in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of polyphosphate-treated C57BL/6J mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate that polyphosphates govern immunomodulation in macrophages and promote acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HIF1A-dependent induction of alveolar epithelial PFKFB3 dampens acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36326834/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe form of lung inflammation causing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients. ALI pathogenesis is closely linked to uncontrolled alveolar inflammation. We hypothesize that specific enzymes of the glycolytic pathway could function as key regulators of alveolar inflammation. Therefore, we screened isolated alveolar epithelia from mice exposed to ALI induced by injurious ventilation to assess their metabolic responses. These studies pointed us toward a selective role for isoform 3 of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3). Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of Pfkfb3 in alveolar epithelia (Pfkfb3loxP/loxP SPC-ER-Cre+ mice) was associated with profound increases in ALI during injurious mechanical ventilation or acid instillation. Studies in genetic models linked Pfkfb3 expression and function to Hif1a. Not only did intratracheal pyruvate instillation reconstitute Pfkfb3loxP/loxP or Hif1aloxP/loxP SPC-ER-Cre+ mice, but pyruvate was also effective in ALI treatment of wild-type mice. Finally, proof-of-principle studies in human lung biopsies demonstrated increased PFKFB3 staining in injured lungs and colocalized PFKFB3 to alveolar epithelia. These studies reveal a specific role for PFKFB3 in counterbalancing alveolar inflammation and lay the groundwork for novel metabolic therapeutic approaches during ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ibrutinib Prevents Acute Lung Injury via Multi-Targeting BTK, FLT3 and EGFR in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36362264/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibrutinib has potential therapeutic or protective effects against viral- and bacterial-induced acute lung injury (ALI), likely by modulating the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling pathway. However, ibrutinib has multi-target effects. Moreover, immunity and inflammation targets in ALI treatment are poorly defined. We investigated whether the BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related signaling pathways mediated the protective effects of ibrutinib on ALI. The intratracheal administration of poly I:C or LPS after ibrutinib administration in mice was performed by gavage. The pathological conditions of the lungs were assessed by micro-CT and HE staining. The levels of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and related inflammatory factors in the lungs were evaluated by ELISA, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. Finally, the expression of proteins associated with the BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related signaling pathways were evaluated by Western blotting. Ibrutinib (10 mg/kg) protected against poly I:C-induced (5 mg/kg) and LPS-induced (5 mg/kg) lung inflammation. The wet/dry weight ratio (W/D) and total proteins in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were markedly reduced after ibrutinib (10 mg/kg) treatment, relative to the poly I:C- and LPS-treated groups. The levels of ALI indicators (NFÎºB, IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) were significantly reduced after treatment. Accordingly, ibrutinib inhibited the poly I:C- and LPS-induced BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related pathway activations. Ibrutinib inhibited poly I:C- and LPS-induced acute lung injury, and this may be due to its ability to suppress the BTK-, FLT3-, and EGFR-related signaling pathways. Therefore, ibrutinib is a potential protective agent for regulating immunity and inflammation in poly I:C- and LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dysfunctional immune response and multiple organ injury in sepsis is a recurrent theme impacting prognosis and mortality, while the lung is the first organ invaded by sepsis. To systematically elucidate the transcriptomic changes in the main constituent cells of sepsis-injured lung tissue, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to the lung tissue samples from septic and control mice and created a comprehensive cellular landscape with 25044 cells, including 11317 immune and 13727 non-immune cells. Sepsis alters the composition of all cellular compartments, particularly neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, endothelial, and fibroblasts populations. Our study firstly provides a single-cell view of cellular changes in septic lung injury. Furthermore, by integrating bulk sequencing data and single-cell data with the Scissors-method, we identified the cell subpopulations that are most associated with septic lung injury phenotype. The phenotypic-related cell subpopulations identified by Scissors-method were consistent with the cell subpopulations with significant composition changes. The function analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the cell-cell interaction analysis further reveal the important role of these phenotype-related subpopulations in septic lung injury. Our research provides a rich resource for understanding cellular changes and provides insights into the contributions of specific cell types to the biological processes that take place during sepsis-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mefunidone ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury through inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway and enhancing Nrf2 pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36334370/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary edema and hyperemia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary structure disorder, inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mefunidone reduces reactive oxygen species generation through increasing expression of nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and objective:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease which has high mortality and lacks effective pharmacological treatments. Excessive inflammation and oxidative stress are the key pathogenesis of ALI. Mefunidone (MFD), a novel small molecule compound, displayed anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress effects on streptozocin (STZ) and db/db mice in our previous studies. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of MFD on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and explore the potential molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the effects of MFD on LPS-induced ALI mouse model and LPS-stimulated immortalized mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MFD could alleviate pulmonary structure disorder and attenuate pulmonary neutrophils infiltration induced by LPS. MFD could also decreased proinflammatory cytokines release and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation stimulated by LPS. Further, MFD could significantly reduce LPS-induced phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), increase expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and restore the expressions of antioxidant enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results firstly supported that MFD effectively protected LPS-induced ALI against inflammation and oxidative stress through inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway and activating Nrf2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of Isolated and Combined Exposure of the Brain and Lungs to a Laser-Induced Shock Wave(s) on Physiological and Neurological Responses in Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35652331/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) has been suggested to be caused by direct head exposure and by torso exposure to a shock wave (thoracic hypotheses). It is unclear, however, how torso exposure affects the brain in real time. This study applied a mild-impulse laser-induced shock wave(s) (LISW[s]) only to the brain (Group 1), lungs (Group 2), or to the brain and lungs (Group 3) in rats. Because LISWs are unaccompanied by a dynamic pressure in principle, the effects of acceleration can be excluded, allowing analysis of the pure primary mechanism (the effects of a shock wave). For all rat groups, real-time monitoring of the brain and systemic responses were conducted for up to 1 h post-exposure and motor function assessments for up to seven days post-exposure. As reported previously, brain exposure alone caused cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), followed by long-lasting hypoxemia and oligemia in the cortices (Group 1). It was found that even LISW application only to the lungs caused prolonged hypoxemia and mitochondrial dysfunction in the cortices (Group 2). Importantly, features of CSD and mitochondrial dysfunction were significantly exacerbated by combined exposure (Group 3) compared with those caused by brain exposure alone (Group 1). Motor dysfunction was observed in all exposure groups, but their time courses differed depending on the groups. Rats with brain exposure alone exhibited the most evident motor dysfunction at one day post-exposure, and after that, it did not change much for up to seven days post-exposure. Alternatively, two groups of rats with lung exposure (Group 2 and Group 3) exhibited continuously aggravated motor functions for up to seven days post-exposure, suggesting different mechanisms for motor dysfunction caused by brain exposure and that caused by lung exposure. As for the reported thoracic hypotheses, our observations seem to support the volumetric blood surge and vagovagal reflex. Overall, the results of this study indicate the importance of the torso guard to protect the brain and its function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles in the pathogenesis and treatment of acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36316787/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are common life-threatening lung diseases associated with acute and severe inflammation. Both have high mortality rates, and despite decades of research on clinical ALI/ARDS, there are no effective therapeutic strategies. Disruption of alveolar-capillary barrier integrity or activation of inflammatory responses leads to lung inflammation and injury. Recently, studies on the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in regulating normal and pathophysiologic cell activities, including inflammation and injury responses, have attracted attention. Injured and dysfunctional cells often secrete EVs into serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with altered cargoes, which can be used to diagnose and predict the development of ALI/ARDS. EVs secreted by mesenchymal stem cells can also attenuate inflammatory reactions associated with cell dysfunction and injury to preserve or restore cell function, and thereby promote cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. This review focuses on the roles of EVs in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation, particularly ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles attenuate tPA-induced blood-brain barrier disruption in murine ischemic stroke models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36367475/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage following blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption resulting from thrombolysis of ischemic stroke with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) remains a critical clinical problem. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are promising nanotherapeutic agents that have the potential to repair the BBB after ischemic stroke; however, whether they can attenuate BBB disruption and hemorrhagic transformation after tPA thrombolysis is largely unknown. Here, we observed that MSC-EVs efficiently passed through the BBB and selectively accumulated in injured brain regions in ischemic stroke model mice in real time using aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), which exhibit better tracking ability than the commercially available tracer DiR. Moreover, tPA administration promoted the homing of MSC-EVs to the ischemic brain and increased the uptake of MSC-EVs by astrocytes. Furthermore, the accumulated MSC-EVs attenuated the tPA-induced disruption of BBB integrity and alleviated hemorrhage by inhibiting astrocyte activation and inflammation. Mechanistically, miR-125b-5p delivered by MSC-EVs played an indispensable role in maintaining BBB integrity by targeting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and inhibiting nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-ÎºB) signaling in astrocytes. This study provides a noninvasive method for real-time tracking of MSC-EVs in the ischemic brain after tPA treatment and highlights the potential of MSC-EVs as thrombolytic adjuvants for ischemic stroke. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Although tPA thrombolysis is the most effective pharmaceutical strategy for acute ischemic stroke, its clinical application and therapeutic efficacy are challenged by tPA-induced BBB disruption and hemorrhagic transformation. Our study demonstrated that MSC-EVs can act as an attractive thrombolytic adjuvant to repair the BBB and improve thrombolysis in a mouse ischemic stroke model. Notably, by labeling MSC-EVs with AIEgens, we achieved accurate real-time imaging of MSC-EVs in the ischemic brain and therapeutic visualization. MSC-EVs inhibit astrocyte activation and associated inflammation through miR-125b-5p/TLR4/NF-ÎºB pathway. Consequently, we revealed that MSC-EVs combined with tPA thrombolysis may be a promising approach for the treatment of ischemic stroke in clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure to Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; causes an inflammatory reaction and fibrosis in lung tissue of mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increases H19 and TNFRSF1A levels, decreases miR-29a-3p levels, and activates the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells and mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;H19 via miR-29a-3p-regulated TNFRSF1A is involved in Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study provide a tool for assessing lung injury risk of Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and other environmental factors that induce inflammatory response and pulmonary fibrosis-associated lncRNAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The occupational and environmental health safety of rare earths has attracted considerable attention. In China, the rare earth neodymium oxide (Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is extensively refined and utilized. However, the mechanisms of Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury are elusive. In the present study, we found that exposure of mice to Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; caused an inflammatory reaction and fibrosis in lung tissues, which was in relation to the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced higher levels of the lncRNA H19 (H19), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFRSF1A), p-p65, and p-IKKÎ² and lower levels of miR-29a-3p. Further, in mouse monocyte macrophage leukemia cells (RAW264.7), Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; induced an inflammatory reaction, increases of H19 and TNFRSF1A levels, decreases of miR-29a-3p levels, and activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB signaling pathway. Further, we established that miR-29a-3p regulates TNFRSF1A expression. Up-regulation of miR-29a-3p and down-regulation of H19 blocked the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced secretion of TNF-Î±, MIP-1Î±, and IL-6; the increases of TNFRSF1A levels; and activation of the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells. Further, in Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-treated RAW26.4 cells, H19 inhibited the expression of miR-29a-3p, which targets TNFRSF1A, and activated the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway to enhance the expression of TNF-Î±, MIP-1Î±, and IL-6. Moreover, for mice, up-regulation of miR-29a-3p reversed lung tissue inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, and activation of the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway induced by Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In sum, the present investigation shows that H19 via miR-29a-3p is involved in lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis induced by Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a mechanism for the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung inflammatory response and pulmonary fibrosis. This information is useful for development of a biomarker of Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long-Term Dietary Lycium ruthenicum Murr. Anthocyanins Intake Alleviated Oxidative Stress-Mediated Aging-Related Liver Injury and Abnormal Amino Acid Metabolism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the relationship between Lycium ruthenicum Murr. anthocyanins (LRA) and health has attracted increasing attention. The purpose of this study is to investigate the anti-aging effect and mechanism of LRA through a D-galactose (DG)-induced aging rat model. Our results showed that the long-term intake of LRA, for 8 weeks, improved motor function, reduced serum aging markers, promoted the endogenous antioxidant system, and suppressed the serum inflammatory cytokines in aging rats. Besides, the LRA treatment alleviated DG-induced liver injuries by relieving the inflammation and inhibiting Fas/FasL-mediated cell death. More importantly, the abnormal serum metabolome profiles of the aging rats were restored by the LRA, relating to 38 metabolites and 44 pathways. Specifically, the LRA significantly affected the amino acid and protein-related metabolic pathways by regulating the levels of L-threonine, L-aspartic acid, glycine, L-histidine, D-homocysteine, L-homocitrulline, L-homoserine, guanidineacetic acid, and kynurenine. These results have important implications for the development of LRA as an anti-aging and liver-protective ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salt-inducible kinase 2 regulates fibrosis during bleomycin-induced lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and normally fatal disease with limited treatment options. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib has recently been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and its effectiveness has been linked to its ability to inhibit a number of receptor tyrosine kinases including the platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor receptors. We show here that nintedanib also inhibits salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2), with a similar IC50 to its reported tyrosine kinase targets. Nintedanib also inhibited the related kinases SIK1 and SIK3, although with 12-fold and 72-fold higher IC50s, respectively. To investigate if the inhibition of SIK2 may contribute to the effectiveness of nintedanib in treating lung fibrosis, mice with kinase-inactive knockin mutations were tested using a model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. We found that loss of SIK2 activity protects against bleomycin-induced fibrosis, as judged by collagen deposition and histological scoring. Loss of both SIK1 and SIK2 activity had a similar effect to loss of SIK2 activity. Total SIK3 knockout mice have a developmental phenotype making them unsuitable for analysis in this model; however, we determined that conditional knockout of SIK3 in the immune system did not affect bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Together, these results suggest that SIK2 is a potential drug target for the treatment of lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TNF stimulation generates pro-survival signals through activation of NF-ÎºB that restrict the build-in death signaling triggered by TNF. The competition between TNF-induced survival and death signals ultimately determines the fate of a cell. Here, we report the identification of Bclaf1 as a novel component of the anti-apoptotic program of TNF. Bclaf1 depletion in multiple cells sensitizes cells to TNF-induced apoptosis but not to necroptosis. Bclaf1 exerts its anti-apoptotic function by promoting the transcription of CFLAR, a caspase 8 antagonist, downstream of NF-ÎºB activation. Bclaf1 binds to the p50 subunit of NF-ÎºB, which is required for Bclaf1 to stimulate CFLAR transcription. Finally, in Bclaf1 siRNA administered mice, TNF-induced small intestine injury is much more severe than in control mice with aggravated signs of apoptosis and pyroptosis. These results suggest Bclaf1 is a key regulator in TNF-induced apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Naringenin attenuates inflammation, apoptosis, and ferroptosis in silver nanoparticle-induced lung injury through a mechanism associated with Nrf2/HO-1 axis: In vitro and in vivo studies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the wide application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), their potential damage to human health needs to be investigated. Lung is one of the main target organs after inhalation of AgNPs. Naringenin has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of naringenin against AgNPs-induced lung injury and determine the underlying mechanism. In in vivo experiments, AgNPs were intratracheally instilled into ICR mice (l mg/kg) to establish a lung injury model. These mice were then treated with naringenin by oral gavage (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) for three days. Naringenin treatment decreased the levels of white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in the blood, ameliorated lung injury, suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, normalized ferroptotic markers and prevented oxidative stress with elevating Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expressions in lung. In in vitro experiments, BEAS-2B cells were firstly treated with AgNPs (320 Î¼g/mL) and then naringenin (25, 50, and 100 Î¼M), respectively. Naringenin attenuated AgNPs-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Moreover, naringenin attenuated AgNPs-induced apoptosis with modulated low BAX, CytC, cleaved Caspase9, cleaved Caspase3 but high Bcl2. Furthermore, naringenin effectively decreased ferroptotic markers and increased the protein expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1, as well as increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Importantly, the anti-apoptotic and anti-ferroptotic effects of naringenin in BEAS-2B cells were found to be at least partially Nrf2-dependent. These results indicated that naringenin exerted anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and anti-ferroptosis effects and protected against AgNPs-induced lung injury at least partly via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Translation Rescue by Targeting Ppp1r15a through Its Upstream Open Reading Frame in Sepsis-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in a Murine Model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36283811/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36283811/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Translation shutdown is a hallmark of late-phase, sepsis-induced kidney injury. Methods for controlling protein synthesis in the kidney are limited. Reversing translation shutdown requires dephosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) subunit eIF2Î±; this is mediated by a key regulatory molecule, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A (Ppp1r15a), also known as GADD34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To study protein synthesis in the kidney in a murine endotoxemia model and investigate the feasibility of translation control &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; by boosting the protein expression of Ppp1r15a, we combined multiple tools, including ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), proteomics, polyribosome profiling, and antisense oligonucleotides, and a newly generated Ppp1r15a knock-in mouse model and multiple mutant cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We report that translation shutdown in established sepsis-induced kidney injury is brought about by excessive eIF2Î± phosphorylation and sustained by blunted expression of the counter-regulatory phosphatase Ppp1r15a. We determined the blunted Ppp1r15a expression persists because of the presence of an upstream open reading frame (uORF). Overcoming this barrier with genetic and antisense oligonucleotide approaches enabled the overexpression of Ppp1r15a, which salvaged translation and improved kidney function in an endotoxemia model. Loss of this uORF also had broad effects on the composition and phosphorylation status of the immunopeptidome-peptides associated with the MHC-that extended beyond the eIF2Î± axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We found Ppp1r15a is translationally repressed during late-phase sepsis because of the existence of an uORF, which is a prime therapeutic candidate for this strategic rescue of translation in late-phase sepsis. The ability to accurately control translation dynamics during sepsis may offer new paths for the development of therapies at codon-level precision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macrophage Sprouty4 deficiency diminishes sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36334381/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation and oxidative stress play critical roles in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Sprout4 (Spry4) is involved in regulating inflammation and tissue injury; however, its role and mechanism in sepsis-induced ALI remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Macrophage-specific Spry4 knockout (Spry4&lt;sup&gt;MKO&lt;/sup&gt;), transgenic (Spry4&lt;sup&gt;MTG&lt;/sup&gt;) mice and matched control littermates were generated and exposed to cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery to establish bacterial sepsis-induced ALI. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Spry4MKO or Spry4&lt;sup&gt;MTG&lt;/sup&gt; mice were isolated and subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation to further validate the role of Spry4 in vitro. To verify the necessity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Spry4 and AMPK double knockout mice and compound C were used in vivo and in vitro. BMDMs were treated with STO-609 to inhibit calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that macrophage Spry4 was increased in CLP mice and positively correlated with sepsis-induced ALI. Macrophage Spry4 deficiency prevented, while macrophage Spry4 overexpression exacerbated sepsis-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and ALI in mice and BMDMs. Mechanistic studies revealed that macrophage Spry4 deficiency alleviated sepsis-induced ALI through activating CaMKK2/AMPK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study identify macrophage Spry4 as a promising predictive and therapeutic target of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>After the Storm: Regeneration, Repair, and Reestablishment of Homeostasis Between the Alveolar Epithelium and Innate Immune System Following Viral Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36270292/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian lung has an enormous environmental-epithelial interface that is optimized to accomplish the principal function of the respiratory system, gas exchange. One consequence of evolving such a large surface area is that the lung epithelium is continuously exposed to toxins, irritants, and pathogens. Maintaining homeostasis in this environment requires a delicate balance of cellular signaling between the epithelium and innate immune system. Following injury, the epithelium can be either fully regenerated in form and function or repaired by forming dysplastic scar tissue. In this review, we describe the major mechanisms of damage, regeneration, and repair within the alveolar niche where gas exchange occurs. With a focus on viral infection, we summarize recent work that has established how epithelial proliferation is arrested during infection and how the innate immune system guides its reconstitution during recovery. The consequence of these processes going awry are also considered, with an emphasis on how this will impact postpandemic pulmonary biology and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CLIC4 localizes to mitochondrial-associated membranes and mediates cardioprotection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36269835/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs) are known to modulate organellar and cellular functions and can subsequently affect pathophysiology including myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Thus, identifying molecular targets in MAMs that regulate the outcome of IR injury will hold a key to efficient therapeutics. Here, we found chloride intracellular channel protein (CLIC4) presence in MAMs of cardiomyocytes and demonstrate its role in modulating ER and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions. In a murine model, loss of CLIC4 increased myocardial infarction and substantially reduced cardiac function after IR injury. CLIC4 null cardiomyocytes showed increased apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction upon hypoxia-reoxygenation injury in comparison to wild-type cardiomyocytes. Overall, our results indicate that MAM-CLIC4 is a key mediator of cellular response to IR injury and therefore may have a potential implication on other pathophysiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histone Lactylation Boosts Reparative Gene Activation Post-Myocardial Infarction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36268709/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation resolution and cardiac repair initiation after myocardial infarction (MI) require timely activation of reparative signals. Histone lactylation confers macrophage homeostatic gene expression signatures via transcriptional regulation. However, the role of histone lactylation in the repair response post-MI remains unclear. We aimed to investigate whether histone lactylation induces reparative gene expression in monocytes early and remotely post-MI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Single-cell transcriptome data indicated that reparative genes were activated early and remotely in bone marrow and circulating monocytes before cardiac recruitment. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining revealed increases in histone lactylation levels, including the previously identified histone H3K18 lactylation in monocyte-macrophages early post-MI. Through joint CUT&amp;amp;Tag and RNA-sequencing analyses, we identified Lrg1, Vegf-a, and IL-10 as histone H3K18 lactylation target genes. The increased modification and expression levels of these target genes post-MI were verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and reverse transcription-qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrated that histone lactylation regulates the anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic dual activities of monocyte-macrophages by facilitating reparative gene transcription and confirmed that histone lactylation favors a reparative environment and improves cardiac function post-MI. Furthermore, we explored the potential positive role of monocyte histone lactylation in reperfused MI. Mechanistically, we provided new evidence that monocytes undergo metabolic reprogramming in the early stage of MI and demonstrated that dysregulated glycolysis and MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter 1)-mediated lactate transport promote histone lactylation. Finally, we revealed the catalytic effect of IL (interleukin)-1Î²-dependent GCN5 (general control non-depressible 5) recruitment on histone H3K18 lactylation and elucidated its potential role as an upstream regulatory element in the regulation of monocyte histone lactylation and downstream reparative gene expression post-MI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Histone lactylation promotes early remote activation of the reparative transcriptional response in monocytes, which is essential for the establishment of immune homeostasis and timely activation of the cardiac repair process post-MI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is the most common complication of sepsis. Intravenous injection of HUMSCs can regulate the level of circulating endothelial cytokines and alleviate lung injury in juvenile septic rats. In this study, we performed proteomic and phosphorylated proteomic analysis of lung tissue of juvenile septic rats after Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (HUMSCs) intervention for the first time, and screened the potential proteins and pathways of HUMSCs for therapeutic effect. The 4D proteome quantitative technique was used to quantitatively analyze the lung tissues of septic rats 24 hours (3 biological samples) and 24 hours after HUMSCs intervention (3 biological samples). A total of 213 proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins, and 971 phosphorylation sites changed significantly. Based on the public database, we analyzed the functional enrichment of these proteins and phosphorylated proteins. In addition, Tenascin-C may be the key differential protein and ECM receptor interaction pathway may be the main signal pathway by using various algorithms to analyze the protein-protein interaction network. Phosphorylation analysis showed that tight junction pathway was closely related to immune inflammatory reaction, and EGFR interacted most, which may be the key differential phosphorylated protein. Finally, 123 conserved motifs of serine phosphorylation site (pS) and 17 conserved motifs of threonine (pT) phosphorylation sites were identified by motif analysis of phosphorylation sites. Results from proteomics and phosphorylated proteomics, the potential new therapeutic targets of HUMSCs in alleviating lung injury in juvenile septic rats were revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pulmonary delivery of curcumin-loaded glycyrrhizic acid nanoparticles for anti-inflammatory therapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36263591/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disease of the lungs. Curcumin (Cur) shows protective effects in ALI animal models. However, Cur is a hydrophobic drug and its administration into the lungs is inefficient due to its low bioavailability. In this study, glycyrrhizic acid (GA) micelles were produced and evaluated as a carrier of Cur for treatment of ALI. Cur-loaded GA (GA-Cur) nanoparticles were produced using an oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation method. The size and surface charge of the GA-Cur nanoparticles were 159 nm and -23 mV, respectively. In lipopolysaccharide-activated RAW264.7 cells, the GA-Cur nanoparticles decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels more efficiently than GA, Cur, or a simple mixture of GA and Cur (GA + Cur). This suggests that the GA-Cur nanoparticles improved the therapeutic efficiency by enhanced delivery of GA and Cur. GA-Cur inhibited the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-Îºb and induced endogenous heme oxygenase-1 more efficiently than the other treatments. Furthermore, an in vitro toxicity test showed that GA-Cur had little cytotoxicity. In vivo therapeutic effects of GA-Cur were evaluated in ALI mouse models. GA-Cur was administered into the animals by intratracheal instillation. The results showed that GA-Cur reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner and did so more efficiently than GA, Cur, or GA + Cur. Furthermore, the hemolysis and infiltration of monocytes into the lungs were more effectively inhibited by GA-Cur than the other treatments. The data indicate that GA is an efficient carrier of Cur and an anti-inflammatory drug. Owing to their delivery efficiency and safety, GA-Cur nanoparticles will be useful for treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rhein ameliorates septic lung injury and intervenes in macrophage metabolic reprogramming in the inflammatory state by Sirtuin 1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36279970/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36279970/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein prevented the progression of acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metabolism in sepsis pathological state was changed after Rhein treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein inhibited the over activation of macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhein preconditioning up-regulated and activated SIRT1 signal pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is an organ dysfunction syndrome caused by the maladjustment of response to infection. Acute lung injury (ALI) appears the earliest, with urgent onset and limited treatments. Previous pharmacological studies have found that rhein (RH), an active ingredient rich in rhubarb, has multiple pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-infection and metabolic regulation. This research aimed to explore whether RH alleviates septic acute lung injury and probe possible mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the septic ALI mouse model was established by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). LPS-induced RAW264.7 model was selected to further explore the protective mechanism of RH. H&amp;amp;E staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR, and 1H NMR analysis were used to verify the protective effect of RH on ALI &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; RH could relieve pathological lung injury and pulmonary edema, reduce the serum LPS and inhibit inflammatory response in CLP mice. Further studies displayed that RH affected the metabolism &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, with significant changes in serum and lung metabolomics. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; results demonstrated that RH inhibited the expression of inflammatory mediators and factors in macrophages by affecting metabolic reprogramming and upregulating the expression of Sirtuin 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; RH improved the overall metabolic condition of sepsis mice by up-regulating and activating SIRT1, and inhibited the over activation of macrophages by regulating metabolism. These findings reveal the therapeutic mechanism of RH on sepsis ALI from the perspective of metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BP5 alleviates endotoxemia-induced acute lung injury by activating Nrf2 via dual regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and the Akt (Ser473)/GSK3Î² (Ser9)/Fyn pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress and inflammation play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). Previously, pentapeptide bursopentin (BP5, Cys-Lys-Arg-Val-Tyr) was reported to possess significant antioxidant activity and inhibit lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced NF-ÎºB activation in vitro, whereas little is known about its effects in vivo. In this study, we explored the effects of BP5 on endotoxemia-induced ALI in mice and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our studies revealed that BP5 markedly improved survival and effectively alleviated lung injury by reducing overoxidation and excessive inflammatory response in endotoxemia mice. In LPS-stimulated mouse primary macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells, BP5 also exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties by enhancing Nrf2 activation. Importantly, these beneficial effects were abolished by Nrf2 knockdown. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we performed localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) assays, molecular docking, together with cell-based studies, and found that BP5 inhibited the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction to promote Nrf2 nuclear translocation and activation. Moreover, BP5-induced Nrf2 activation was shown to be accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt (at Ser473) and GSK3Î² (at Ser9), and a decrease in Fyn nuclear accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacologically inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3Î² obviously enhanced Fyn nuclear accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells, which partially attenuated the promoting effect of BP5 on Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and activation. Furthermore, In Nrf2-/- mice, the protective effects of BP5 on the endotoxemia-induced ALI in WT mice were largely vanished. Our findings indicated that BP5 effectively protected endotoxemia-induced ALI against oxidative stress and inflammatory response, which are largely dependent on activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Underlying mechanisms include dual regulation of the Keap-Nrf2 interaction and the Akt (Ser473)/GSK3Î² (Ser9)/Fyn pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Memantine nitrate MN-08 suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation to protect against sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36272262/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 significantly increased the survival rate of septic mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 improved SIRS and immune dysfunction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 attenuated septic lung injury and inflammatory infiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MN-08 exerts its protection via suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction with devastating consequences, prominent among which is lung damage. Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, is able to alleviate acute lung injury (ALI). Nitric oxide (NO) suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. MN-08, a novel nitrate derivative of memantine, possesses both the ability to antagonize NMDAR and release NO. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of MN-08 against LPS-induced systemic inflammation and septic lung injury in mice, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of MN-08 in LPS-induced mice and THP-1 macrophages. MN-08 significantly increased the survival rate of septic mice, alleviated LPS-induced sepsis in mice via improving systemic inflammatory response syndrome and immune dysfunction, and attenuated pulmonary injury and inflammatory infiltration. More importantly, the therapeutic benefit of MN-08 for sepsis was greater than that of memantine and dexamethasone. Mechanistically, MN-08 exerted anti-inflammatory activity through inhibiting nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB, activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and the signaling transduction of STAT3/NF-ÎºB. In addition, MN-08 suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that MN-08 may be a promising therapeutic agent for sepsis-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RNA-Sequencing approach for exploring the therapeutic effect of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem/stromal cells on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36341363/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is significantly associated with morbidity and mortality in patients with critical diseases. In recent years, studies have identified that mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) ameliorate ALI and pulmonary fibrosis. However, the mechanism underlying this outcome in ALI has not yet been investigated. In this study, RNA sequencing technology was used to analyze the gene expression profile of lung tissue in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI rats following treatment with human umbilical cord MSC (HUCMSC). Differential expression analyses, gene ontology annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment, protein-protein interaction network identification, and hub gene analysis were also performed. HUCMSC treatment decreased inflammatory factor production and alveolar exudates, and attenuated lung damage in LPS-induced ALI rats. The RNA-Seq data indicated that HUCMSC treatment activated the IL-17, JAK-STAT, NF-ÎºB, and TNF-Î± signaling pathways, increased oxygen transport, and decreased extracellular matrix organization. HUCMSC exert beneficial effects on ALI via these signaling pathways by reducing inflammation, inhibiting pulmonary fibrosis, and improving lung ventilation. Moreover, our study further revealed the hub genes (&lt;em&gt;Tbx2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nkx2-1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Atf5&lt;/em&gt;) and signaling pathways involved in HUCMSC treatment, thus providing novel perspectives for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell treatment of ALI. HUCMSC can regulate multiple genes and signaling pathways, which can prevent LPS-induced lung damage in an ALI rat model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A mouse model characterizes the roles of ZIP8 in systemic iron recycling and lung inflammation and infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36260707/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZIP8 knockout mice have elevated spleen iron levels and relative hypoferremia, suggesting that ZIP8 plays a role in iron recycling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While lung ZIP8 is induced with inflammation, ZIP8 deletion in mice had no detrimental effects on acute lung injury or bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZIP8 (SLC39A8) is a transmembrane divalent metal ion importer that is most highly expressed in the lung and is inducible by inflammatory stimuli. In addition to zinc and manganese, ZIP8 can transport iron but its specific roles in iron regulation during homeostatic and pathologic processes remain poorly understood. Using a novel global inducible ZIP8 knockout (KO) mouse, we analyzed the role of ZIP8 in steady-state iron homeostasis and during inflammation and infection. We observed an unexpected phenotype of elevated spleen iron levels and decreased serum iron in ZIP8 KO mice, suggesting that ZIP8 plays a role in iron recycling. We also showed that ZIP8 is expressed on lung distal airspace epithelial cells and transports iron from the airway into lung tissue. LPS-induced inflammation induced ZIP8 expression in the lung, but ZIP8 deletion had no detrimental effect on the severity of LPS-induced acute lung injury or on the outcomes of &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; lung infection. Thus, ZIP8 plays a role in systemic iron homeostasis but does not modulate the severity of inflammatory lung injury or the host defense against a common bacterial cause of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA-VO-ME was successfully prepared with greater bioavailability (214%) than CA-VO in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA-VO-ME reduced the LPS-induced increase in levels of NO, TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1Î², iNOS and COX-2 in vitro and/or in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA-VO-ME had powerful effect on ameliorating the histopathological changes, prolonging the survival of ALI mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA-VO-ME exerted a better effect on ALI than CA-VO, suggesting that CA-VO-ME is a promising drug for the treatment of ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI), a clinical syndrome of acute respiratory failure due to acute lung inflammation, remains a substantial public health problem in the worldwide. Ligusticum Chuanxiong Rhizoma and Angelicae Sinensis Radix was herb-pair of the traditional Chinese medicine. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that volatile oil extracted from Chuanxiong Rhizome and Angelicae Sinensis Radix is identified as an important active ingredient, which has good antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, whether their volatile oil combination (CA-VO), has effects on the prevention and treatment of ALI has not been reported yet. Due to poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability of CA-VO, CA -VO-loaded microemulsion (CA-VO-ME) was formulated to enhance its oral bioavailability. The physical properties of CA-VO-ME were characterized. The pharmacokinetic parameters and the effect on ALI were evaluated. The particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of CA-VO-ME were 20.19 Â± 0.08 nm, 0.091 Â± 0.01, 36.33 Â± 4.29%, and 93.75%, respectively. CA-VO-ME had a greater bioavailability (214%) than CA-VO. CA-VO-ME reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increase in levels of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in vitro and/or in vivo. Moreover, CA-VO-ME treatment notably decreased the lung index, ameliorated histopathological changes and prolonged the survival of ALI mice. By comparison, CA-VO-ME exerted a better effect on ALI than CA-VO, suggesting that CA-VO-ME is a promising drug for the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gallic, ellagic acids and their oral combined administration induce kidney, lung, and heart injury after acute exposure in Wistar rats</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallic (GA) and ellagic (EA) acids are present in foods, medicinal plants, teas, and dietary supplements. An acute toxicological study was conducted by oral administration of both compounds alone (200, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg) and combined (2000 mg/kg) and their effects on the electron transport chain (ETC) and the ROS production in kidney mitochondria further evaluated. All treatments induced a dose-dependent heart, lung, and kidney injury. However, the intensity of these effects varied according to the substance, with greater cardiac and renal toxicity for EA and pulmonary injury for GA, while the combination attenuated the toxicity of the isolated molecules. All substances inhibited the activity of complexes II, III, and IV of the ETC from renal mitochondria. However, no changes were observed regarding mitochondrial ROS production. These compounds have a non-negligible inherent deleterious potential, so their uncontrolled use at high doses (â¥200 mg/kg) could cause undesirable effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of ferroptosis and iron accumulation alleviates pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin model</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36302319/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive disease characterized by excessive proliferation of fibroblasts and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by the lethal accumulation of iron and lipid peroxidation, which is associated with many diseases. Our study addressed the potential role played by ferroptosis and iron accumulation in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. We found that the inducers of pulmonary fibrosis and injury, namely, bleomycin (BLM) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induced ferroptosis of lung epithelial cells. Both the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1) and the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) alleviated the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin or LPS. TGF-Î² stimulation upregulated the expression of transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC) in the human lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) and mouse primary lung fibroblasts, resulting in increased intracellular Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which promoted the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Mechanistically, TGF-Î² enhanced the expression and nuclear localization of the transcriptional coactivator tafazzin (TAZ), which combined with the transcription factor TEA domain protein (TEAD)-4 to promote the transcription of TFRC. In addition, elevated Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; failed to induce the ferroptosis of fibroblasts, which might be related to the regulation of iron export and lipid metabolism. Finally, we specifically knocked out TFRC expression in fibroblasts in mice, and compared with those in the control mice, the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis were reduced in the knockout mice after bleomycin induction. Collectively, these findings suggest the therapeutic potential of ferroptosis inhibitors and iron chelators in treating pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microvascular lung injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress in systemic lupus erythematosus-associated alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary vasculitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36255715/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human &lt;em&gt;COPA&lt;/em&gt; mutations affecting retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein transport cause diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and ER stress (&amp;ldquo;COPA syndrome&amp;rdquo;). Patients with SLE also can develop DAH. C57BL/6 (B6) mice with pristane-induced lupus develop monocyte-dependent DAH indistinguishable from human DAH, whereas BALB/c mice are resistant. We examined Copa and ER stress in pristane-induced lupus. &lt;em&gt;Copa&lt;/em&gt; expression, ER stress, vascular injury, and apoptosis were assessed in mice and &lt;em&gt;COPA&lt;/em&gt; was quantified in blood from patients with SLE. &lt;em&gt;Copa&lt;/em&gt; mRNA and protein expression were impaired in B6 mice with pristane-induced DAH, but not in pristane-treated BALB/c mice. An ER stress response (increased &lt;em&gt;Hsp5a&lt;/em&gt;/BiP, &lt;em&gt;Ddit3&lt;/em&gt;/CHOP, &lt;em&gt;Eif2a&lt;/em&gt;, and spliced &lt;em&gt;Xbp1&lt;/em&gt;) was seen in lungs from pristane-treated B6, but not BALB/c, mice. Resistance of BALB/c mice to DAH was overcome by treating them with low-dose thapsigargin plus pristane. CB6F1 mice did not develop DAH or ER stress, suggesting that susceptibility was recessive. Increased pulmonary expression of von Willebrand factor (&lt;em&gt;Vwf&lt;/em&gt;), a marker of endothelial injury, and the chemokine &lt;em&gt;Ccl2&lt;/em&gt; in DAH suggested that pristane promotes lung microvascular injury and monocyte recruitment. Consistent with that possibility, lung endothelial cells and infiltrating bone marrow-derived cells from pristane-treated B6 mice expressed BiP and showed evidence of apoptosis (annexin-V and activated caspase-3 staining). &lt;em&gt;COPA&lt;/em&gt; expression also was low in patients with SLE with lung involvement. Pristane-induced DAH may be initiated by endothelial injury, resulting in ER stress, apoptosis of lung endothelial cells, and recruitment of myeloid cells that propagate lung injury. The pathogenesis of DAH in SLE and COPA syndrome may overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kidney-Targeted Nanoparticles Loaded with the Natural Antioxidant Rosmarinic Acid for Acute Kidney Injury Treatment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36253133/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical disease with high morbidity and mortality, and with a lack of effective drugs for treatment. Oxidative stress is very important in the occurrence and progression of AKI, and antioxidants use is one of the promising treatments. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a ubiquitous natural polyphenol with powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Due to its inherent characteristic with poor water solubility and inferior bioavailability, its clinical application is impeded. Hence, the authors design a nanoparticle for effectively delivering RA, which is a chemical complex of RA and fourth-generation poly-amidoamine-based amphiphilic polymer (G4-PAMAM). The nanoparticle is modified with l-serine due to the specific interaction between kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) and serine, which eventually generates a promising AKI kidney-targeting nanoparticle (S-G-R). The S-G-R is rapidly cumulated and long-term retained in ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI kidneys, especially in the damaged renal tubular cells. The S-G-R exhibits more excellent antioxidative and antiapoptotic effects in vitro and has a more outstanding ability to improve the renal function, repair damaged renal tissue, and decrease oxidative stress, inflammatory response and apoptosis of tubular cells in vivo. Overall, this study might develop a safe and effective targeting strategy for the therapy of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin prevents against LPS-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astaxanthin attenuates ferroptosis against lps-induced acute lung injury by Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a form of regulated nonapoptotic cell death associated with iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Previous studies have shown that ferroptosis is involved in the occurrence and development of acute lung injury (ALI). In this study, a systems pharmacology approach was performed through the overall process of target acquisition, network construction, and further analysis. Then, the effects of astaxanthin on LPS-induced inflammation and ferroptosis were investigated in RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS in vitro and ALI mice induced by LPS in vivo. The enrichment analysis of astaxanthin-target gene is closely related to the occurrence and development mechanism of ferroptosis. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of astaxanthin acting on ALI found that these intersection genes are associated with ALI inflammatory pathway. In addition, astaxanthin can effectively inhibit LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ferroptosis in RAW264.7 cells. Consistently, administration of astaxanthin protected mice against LPS-induced ALI and significantly decreased the extent of lung edema, inflammatory cells infiltration, and ferroptosis in vivo, and Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is involved in astaxanthin inhibits LPS-induced ALI and ferroptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that astaxanthin inhibit inflammation and ferroptosis by regulating Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to reduce LPS-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profiling defines shared and unique epithelial injury responses during kidney fibrosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying cellular events driving kidney fibrogenesis and metabolic dysfunction are incompletely understood. Here, we employed single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing to analyze 24 mouse kidneys from two fibrosis models. We profiled 309,666 cells in one experiment, representing 50 cell types/states encompassing epithelial, endothelial, immune, and stromal populations. Single-cell analysis identified diverse injury states of the proximal tubule, including two distinct early-phase populations with dysregulated lipid and amino acid metabolism, respectively. Lipid metabolism was defective in the chronic phase but was transiently activated in the very early stages of ischemia-induced injury, where we discovered increased lipid deposition and increased fatty acid Î²-oxidation. Perilipin 2 was identified as a surface marker of intracellular lipid droplets, and its knockdown in vitro disrupted cell energy state maintenance during lipid accumulation. Surveying epithelial cells across nephron segments identified shared and unique injury responses. Stromal cells exhibited high heterogeneity and contributed to fibrogenesis by epithelial-stromal crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 protects PM2.5 exposure-induced lung injury in mice by repressing inflammation and oxidative stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36242005/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Airborne fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter â¤ 2.5 Î¼m (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) pollution is associated with the prevalence of respiratory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In patients with those diseases, circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels are increased, which contributes to airway nitric oxide deficiency, oxidative stress and inflammation. Overexpression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1), an enzyme degrading ADMA, exerts protective effects in animal models. However, the impact of DDAH1/ADMA on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and DDAH1-transgenic mice, as well as their respective wild-type (WT) littermates, were exposed to either filtered air or airborne PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; (mean daily concentration ~ 50 Âµg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for 6 months through a whole-body exposure system. Mice were also acutely exposed to 10 mg/kg PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and/or exogenous ADMA (2 mg/kg) via intratracheal instillation every other day for 2 weeks. Inflammatory response, oxidative stress and related gene expressions in the lungs were examined. In addition, RAW264.7 cells were exposed to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and/or ADMA and the changes in intracellular oxidative stress and inflammatory response were determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice developed more severe lung injury than WT mice after long-term PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, which was associated with greater induction of pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation. In the lungs of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed mice, &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency increased protein expression of p-p65, iNOS and Bax, and decreased protein expression of Bcl-2, SOD1 and peroxiredoxin 4. Conversely, DDAH1 overexpression significantly alleviated lung injury, attenuated pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation, and exerted opposite effects on those proteins in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed mice. In addition, exogenous ADMA administration could mimic the effect of &lt;em&gt;Ddah1&lt;/em&gt; deficiency on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury, oxidative stress and inflammation. In PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-exposed macrophages, ADMA aggravated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in an iNOS-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our data revealed that DDAH1 has a marked protective effect on long-term PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interplay between mucus mobility and alveolar macrophage targeting of surface-modified liposomes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36209941/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alveolar macrophages play a crucial role in the initiation and resolution of the immune response in the lungs. Pro-inflammatory M1 alveolar macrophages are an interesting target for treating inflammatory and infectious pulmonary diseases. One commune targeting strategy is to use nanoparticles conjugated with hyaluronic acid, which interact with CD44 overexpressed on the membrane of those cells. Unfortunately, this coating strategy may be countered by the presence on the surface of the nanoparticles of a poly(ethylene glycol) corona employed to improve nanoparticles&amp;rsquo; diffusion in the lung mucus. This study aims to measure this phenomenon by comparing the behavior in a murine lung inflammation model of three liposomal platforms designed to represent different poly(ethylene glycol) and hyaluronic acid densities (Liposome-PEG, Liposome-PEG-HA and Liposome-HA). In this work, the liposomes were obtained by a one-step ethanol injection method. Their interaction with mucin and targeting ability toward pro-inflammatory macrophages were then investigated in vitro and in vivo in a LPS model of lung inflammation. In vitro, poly(ethylene glycol) free HA-liposomes display a superior targeting efficiency toward M1 macrophages, while the addition of poly(ethylene glycol) induces better mucus mobility. Interestingly in vivo studies revealed that the three liposomes showed distinct cell specificity with alveolar macrophages demonstrating an avidity for poly(ethylene glycol) free HA-liposomes, while neutrophils favored PEGylated liposomes exempt of HA. Those results could be explained by the presence of two forces exercising a balance between mucus penetration and receptor targeting. This study corroborates the importance of considering the site of action and the targeted cells when designing nanoparticles to treat lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modulatory effects of 17Î²-estradiol on acute lung inflammation after total occlusion of the descending aorta in male rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36252489/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aortic ischemia and reperfusion leads to lung inflammatory activation with edema and leukocyte infiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E2 preventive effects include decreasing of edema, iNOS expression and preventing leukocyte infiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E2 is able to prevent the increased expression of ET-1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our study can be considered is one more step towards using E2 to prevent the local and remote inflammatory response after descending thoracic aorta cross-clamping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of systemic inflammation caused by ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) due to aortic occlusion, the lungs can exhibit increased microvascular permeability, local release of pro-inflammatory mediators, and leukocyte infiltration. Lung tissue infiltration by activated neutrophils is followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is linked to acute pulmonary microvascular damage, high mortality rates, and organ dysfunction. Previous studies have demonstrated that female sex hormones modulate the inflammatory response and that prophylactic treatment with 17Î²-estradiol (E2) can prevent fatalities and preserve mesenteric perfusion and intestinal integrity after ischemia/reperfusion induced by aortic occlusion. In this study, we focused on the protective effects of estradiol after aortic ischemia/reperfusion by evaluating lung injury and endothelial alterations. Upon anesthesia and mechanical ventilation, male rats were subjected to aortic occlusion for 20 min, followed by 2 h of reperfusion. In parallel, one group of rats received a single injection of estradiol (280 Âµg/kg, i.v.) 30 min before ischemia. We observed increased serum concentrations of IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-10 in the I/R rats and E2 was able to reduce them. E2 effects after 2 h of reperfusion resulted mainly in decreasing of edema, iNOS expression and preventing leukocyte infiltration. Overall, our data indicate that estradiol might be a supplementary approach to deal with systemic processes and lung deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New mechanism for mesenchymal stem cell microvesicle to restore lung permeability: intracellular S1P signaling pathway independent of S1P receptor-1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36209115/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Microvesicles (MVs) derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) were demonstrated to restore lung protein permeability and attenuate acute lung injury. In our previous study, we found that MSC MV increased sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) kinase1 mRNA levels in injured human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC) significantly. However, the role of S1P signaling in MSC MV to restore lung protein permeability is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we hypothesized that MSC MV might restore lung permeability in part through increasing intracellular S1P signaling pathway in injured HLMVEC independent of S1P receptors. We used the transwell co-culture system to study the effect of MSC MV on protein permeability of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) damaged HLMVEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our results showed that LPS significantly increased the permeability of HLMVEC to FITC-dextran (70 kDa) within 24 h. MSC MV restores this permeability and, to a large extent, prevents the cytoskeleton protein F-actin from recombining into &amp;ldquo;actin stress fibers,&amp;rdquo; and restores the positions of tight junctions and adhesion junctions in the damaged HLMVEC. This therapeutic effect of MSC MV was related to the increase in the S1P level in injured HLMVEC and was not eliminated when adding the antagonist of S1P receptor, suggesting that MSC MV to restore lung permeability was independent of S1P receptors on HLMVEC. Laser confocal further observed that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mobilization and Rac1 activation in LPS injured HLMVEC were increased in parallel with the increase in intracellular S1P level after MSC MV treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In short, MSC MV partially restored protein permeability across HLMVEC through the intracellular S1P signaling pathway independent of S1P receptor-1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiota-derived succinate aggravates acute lung injury after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36229053/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Gut microbiota and their metabolic byproducts act as important modulators of the gut-lung axis. This study aimed to define the role of succinate, a key microbiota metabolite, in intestinal I/R-induced ALI progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Gut and lung microbiota of mice subjected to intestinal I/R were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Succinate level alterations were measured in Germ-free (GF) mice or conventional mice treated with antibiotics. Succinate-induced alveolar macrophage polarisation and its effects on alveolar epithelial apoptosis were evaluated in succinate receptor1 (&lt;em&gt;Sucnr1&lt;/em&gt;)-deficient mice and in murine alveolar macrophages transfected with &lt;em&gt;Sucnr1&lt;/em&gt;-siRNA. Succinate levels were measured in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, including intestinal I/R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Succinate accumulated in lungs after intestinal I/R, and this was associated with an imbalance of succinate-producing and succinate-consuming bacteria in the gut, but not the lungs. Succinate accumulation was absent in GF mice and was reversed by gut microbiota depletion with antibiotics, indicating that gut microbiota are a source of lung succinate. Moreover, succinate promoted alveolar macrophage polarisation, alveolar epithelial apoptosis, and lung injury during intestinal I/R. Conversely, knockdown of &lt;em&gt;Sucnr1&lt;/em&gt; or blockage of SUCNR1 &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; reversed the effects of succinate by modulating PI3K-AKT/HIF-1Î± pathway. Plasma succinate levels significantly correlated with intestinal I/R-related lung injury after cardiopulmonary bypass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Gut microbiota-derived succinate exacerbates intestinal I/R-induced ALI through SUCNR1-dependent alveolar macrophage polarisation, identifying succinate as a novel target for gut-derived ALI in critically ill patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oxaloacetate acid ameliorates paraquat-induced acute lung injury by alleviating oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36313362/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is the primary cause of death among patients with acute paraquat (PQ) poisoning, whereby peroxidative damage is an important mechanism underlying PQ-induced lung injury. There is a lack of effective interventional drugs for patients with PQ poisoning. Oxaloacetic acid (OAA) participates in multiple &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; metabolic processes, whereby it facilitates the clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improves mitochondrial function. The study aimed to assess the protective effects of OAA on PQ-induced ALI and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. Our data demonstrated that OAA treatment significantly alleviated PQ-induced ALI and improved the survival rate of PQ-poisoned mice, and also alleviated PQ-induced cellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. OAA-mediated alleviation of PQ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction depends on the following mechanisms which may explain the above findings: 1) OAA effectively cleared intracellular ROS, inhibited ROS accumulation, and mitochondrial depolarization; 2) OAA inhibited the downregulation of L-OPA1 and MFN2 caused by PQ and promoted a dynamic balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission, and 3) the expression of PGC-1Î±, TFAM, COX2, and COX4I1, increased significantly following OAA intervention which improved mitochondrial respiratory functions and promoted its biogenesis and energy metabolism in damaged cells. In conclusion, OAA effectively cleared ROS and improved mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby significantly improving ALI caused by PQ poisoning and the animal survival rate. Therefore, OAA may be a potential drug for the treatment of PQ poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In-line miniature 3D-printed pressure-cycled ventilator maintains respiratory homeostasis in swine with induced acute pulmonary injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36223450/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the need for inexpensive, easy-to-use, rapidly mass-produced resuscitation devices that could be quickly distributed in areas of critical need. In-line miniature ventilators based on principles of fluidics ventilate patients by automatically oscillating between forced inspiration and assisted expiration as airway pressure changes, requiring only a continuous supply of pressurized oxygen. Here, we designed three miniature ventilator models to operate in specific pressure ranges along a continuum of clinical lung injury (mild, moderate, and severe injury). Three-dimensional (3D)-printed prototype devices evaluated in a lung simulator generated airway pressures, tidal volumes, and minute ventilation within the targeted range for the state of lung disease each was designed to support. In testing in domestic swine before and after induction of pulmonary injury, the ventilators for mild and moderate injury met the design criteria when matched with the appropriate degree of lung injury. Although the ventilator for severe injury provided the specified design pressures, respiratory rate was elevated with reduced minute ventilation, a result of lung compliance below design parameters. Respiratory rate reflected how well each ventilator matched the injury state of the lungs and could guide selection of ventilator models in clinical use. This simple device could help mitigate shortages of conventional ventilators during pandemics and other disasters requiring rapid access to advanced airway management, or in transport applications for hands-free ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-1249 on Endothelial Extracellular Vesicles Mediates Cigarette Smoke-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension by Inhibiting HDAC10 (Histone Deacetylase 10)-NFÎºB (Nuclear Factor ÎºB)-CaSR (Calcium-Sensing Receptor) Cascade</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Overproduction of endothelial extracellular vesicles (eEVs) is correlated with pulmonary hypertension progression, but the precise mechanism remains largely unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; MicroRNA-chip and real-time polymerase chain reaction were conducted to screen and validate microRNA profiles in blood plasma eEVs of rats and human with or without cigarette smoking. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were cultured to study signaling pathways. Pulmonary hypertension phenotypes were evaluated in wild-type and calcium-sensing receptor knockout rats to identify the pathophysiological significance of the microRNA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MicroR-1249 was predominant highly expressed in eEVs from plasma of rats exposed to cigarette smoking, and confirmed in eEVs from plasma of human smokers as well as in eEVs from cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery endothelial cells, but not in cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. In cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, microR-1249 downregulated the expression of histone deacetylase 10, which in turn enhanced the acetylated form of NFÎºB (nuclear factor ÎºB) level and its nuclear translocation leading to increased expression of calcium-sensing receptor. In rats, the repression of microR-1249 in eEVs by microR-1249 inhibitor, histone deacetylase 10 overexpression, or calcium-sensing receptor knockout profoundly inhibited the proliferative capacities and diminished apoptosis-resistance of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and pulmonary hypertension development in rats intravenously administrated with eEVs preparation from cigarette smoke extract-treated pulmonary artery endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Cigarette smoke-enriched microR-1249 in endothelial extracellular vesicles facilitates the hyperproliferative and antiapoptotic status of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells promoting pulmonary hypertension evolution through the inhibition of histone deacetylase 10-NFÎºB-calcium-sensing receptor cascade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Precise Monitoring and Assessing Treatment Response of Sepsis-Induced Acute Lung Hypoxia with a Nitroreductase-Activated Golgi-Targetable Fluorescent Probe</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36223488/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is mostly attributed to an outbreak of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which makes leukocytes infiltrate into the lung and results in lung hypoxia. Nitroreductase (NTR) is significantly upregulated under hypoxia, which is commonly regarded as a potential biomarker for assessing sepsis-induced acute lung hypoxia. Increasing evidence shows that NTR in the Golgi apparatus could be induced in sepsis-induced ALI. Meanwhile, the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor (dimethyloxalylglycine, DMOG) attenuated sepsis-induced ALI through further increasing the level of Golgi NTR by improving hypoxia inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±) activity, but as yet, no Golgi-targetable probe has been developed for monitoring and assessing treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI. Herein, we report a Golgi-targetable probe, Gol-NTR, for monitoring and assessing treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI through mapping the generation of NTR. The probe displayed high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 54.8 ng/mL and good selectivity to NTR. In addition, due to the excellent characteristics of Golgi-targetable, Gol-NTR was successfully applied in mapping the change of Golgi NTR in cells and zebrafish caused by various stimuli. Most importantly, the production of Golgi NTR in the sepsis-induced ALI and the PHD inhibitor (DMOG) against sepsis-induced ALI were visualized and precisely assessed for the first time with the assistance of Gol-NTR. The results demonstrated the practicability of Gol-NTR for the precise monitoring and assessing of the personalized treatment response of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schisandrin B protects against LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury by targeting MyD88</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36270224/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a challenging clinical syndrome that manifests as an acute inflammatory response. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a bioactive lignan from Schisandra genus plants, has been shown to suppress inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypothesis/purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study performed an in-depth investigation of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Sch B in macrophages and in an animal model of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; qPCR array was used to probe the differential effects and potential target of Sch B. ALI was induced by intratracheal administration of LPS in experimental mice with or without Sch B treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our studies show that Sch B differentially modulates inflammatory factor induction by LPS in macrophages by directly binding myeloid differentiation response factor-88 (MyD88), an essential adaptor protein in the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) pathway. Sch B spares non-MyD88-pathways downstream of TLR4. Such inhibition suppressed key signaling mediators such as TAK1, MAPKs, and NF-ÎºB, and pro-inflammatory factor induction. Pull down assay using biotinylated-Sch B validate the direct interaction between Sch B and MyD88 in macrophages. Treatment of mice with Sch B prior to LPS challenge reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in lungs, induction of MyD88-pathway signaling proteins, and prevented inflammatory cytokine induction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, our studies have identified MyD88 as a direct target of Sch B for its anti-inflammatory activity, and suggest that Sch B may have therapeutic value for acute lung injury and other MyD88-dependent inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C-X-C-Chemokine-Receptor-Type-4 Inhibitor AMD3100 Attenuates Pulmonary Inflammation and Fibrosis in Silicotic Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36238768/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Silicosis is a severe pulmonary disease caused by inhaling dust containing crystalline silica. The progression of silicosis to pulmonary fibrosis is usually unavoidable. Recent studies have revealed positivity for the overexpression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in pulmonary fibrosis and shown that the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 attenuated pulmonary fibrosis after bleomycin challenge and paraquat exposure. However, it is unclear whether AMD3100 reduces crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 male mice were instilled intranasally with a single dose of crystalline silica (12 mg/60 Î¼L) to establish an acute silicosis mouse model. Twelve hours later, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg AMD3100 or control solution. Then, the mice were weighed daily and sacrificed on day 7, 14, or 28 to collect lung tissue and peripheral blood. Western blotting was also applied to determine the level of CXCR4, while different histological techniques were used to assess pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In addition, the level of B cells in peripheral blood was measured by flow cytometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 were upregulated in the lung tissues of crystalline silica-exposed mice. Blocking CXCR4 with AMD3100 suppressed the upregulation of CXCR4/CXCL12, reduced the severity of lung injury, and prevented weight loss. It also inhibited neutrophil infiltration at inflammatory sites and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, as well as reduced B-lymphocyte aggregates in the lung. Additionally, it decreased the recruitment of circulating fibrocytes (CD45+collagen I+CXCR4+) to the lung and the deposition of collagen I and Î±-smooth muscle actin in lung tissue. AMD3100 also increased the level of B cells in peripheral blood, preventing circulating B cells from migrating to the injured lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Blocking CXCR4 with AMD3100 delays pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in a silicosis mouse model, suggesting the potential of AMD3100 as a drug for treating silicosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ninjin&#39;yoeito ameliorated PPE-induced pulmonary emphysema and anxiety/depressive-like behavior in aged C57BL/6J mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing in the elderly. COPD is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway remodeling and alveolar emphysema. COPD patients are also at high risk for mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. &lt;em&gt;Ninjin&amp;rsquo;yoeito&lt;/em&gt; (NYT) is prescribed to patients with conditions such as post-illness and postoperative weakness, fatigue, poor appetite, skin rash, cold hands and feet, and anemia. In addition to traditional uses, NYT is also prescribed as a therapeutic drug for poor functioning of the digestive organs, respiratory organs, and urinary organs. NYT is also known to have an antioxidant effect. The objective of this study was to investigate whether NYT could ameliorate COPD-induced lung injury and anxiety/depression in aged C57BL/6J mice exposed to porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE). While intratracheal administration of PPE induced emphysema in elderly mice, long-term administration of NYT suppressed the pathology. NYT was also found to suppress the apoptosis and oxidative stress caused by PPE. In addition, long-term administration of NYT was found to ameliorate PPE-induced depressive-like behavior in three different behavioral studies. These results suggest that NYT has a therapeutic effect on emphysema and the behavioral abnormalities caused by PPE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sulforaphane alleviated vascular remodeling in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension via inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36220525/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH) is a cardiopulmonary disease featured by pulmonary vascular remodeling, which is due to abnormal proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and dysfunction of endothelial cells (ECs). Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural isothiocyanate extracted from cruciferous vegetables with promising anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of SFN on HPH. Male mice were exposed to persistent chronic hypoxia for 4 weeks to induce HPH. The results demonstrated that SFN repressed the increased right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and attenuated the right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary arteries remodeling in HPH mice. In particular, after SFN treatment, the CD68 positive cells in lung sections were reduced; TNF-Î± and IL-6 levels in lungs and serum declined; activation of NF-ÎºB in PASMCs was inhibited in response to hypoxia. Besides, SFN enhanced the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum, SOD2 expression, total glutathione levels, and GSH/GSSG ratio in PASMCs, along with a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in serum and ROS production in PASMCs after hypoxia exposure. Notably, SFN, as an Nrf2 activator, reversed the reduction in Nrf2 expression in hypoxic PASMCs. In vitro, SFN treatment inhibited hyperproliferation and promoted apoptosis of PASMCs under hypoxia conditions. SFN also prevented the apoptosis of pulmonary microvascular ECs caused by hypoxia. Therefore, these data suggested that SFN could significantly restrain the inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting PASMCs proliferation, promoting PASMCs apoptosis, and reversing hypoxia injury in ECs to improve pulmonary vascular remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distinct roles of ORAI1 in T cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation and immunity to influenza A virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36206339/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T cell activation and function depend on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals mediated by store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE) through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release-activated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (CRAC) channels formed by ORAI1 proteins. We here investigated how SOCE controls T cell function in pulmonary inflammation during a T helper 1 (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1) cell-mediated response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation. T cell-specific deletion of &lt;em&gt;Orai1&lt;/em&gt; did not exacerbate pulmonary inflammation and viral burdens following IAV infection but protected mice from house dust mite-induced allergic airway inflammation. ORAI1 controlled the expression of genes including p53 and E2F transcription factors that regulate the cell cycle in T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells in response to allergen stimulation and the expression of transcription factors and cytokines that regulate T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cell function. Systemic application of a CRAC channel blocker suppressed allergic airway inflammation without compromising immunity to IAV infection, suggesting that inhibition of SOCE is a potential treatment for allergic airway disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2,3,5,4&#39;-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-Î²-D-glucoside ameliorates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via regulating pro-fibrotic signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36267283/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2,3,5,4&amp;rsquo;-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-Î²-D-Glucoside (THSG) is the main active ingredient extracted from &lt;em&gt;Polygonum multiflorum&lt;/em&gt; Thunb. (PMT), which has been reported to possess extensive pharmacological properties. Nevertheless, the exact role of THSG in pulmonary fibrosis has not been demonstrated yet. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of THSG against bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis in a murine model, and explore the underlying mechanisms of THSG in transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-Î²1)-induced fibrogenesis using MRC-5 human lung fibroblast cells. We found that THSG significantly attenuated lung injury by reducing fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition. THSG treatment significantly downregulated the expression levels of TGF-Î²1, fibronectin, Î±-SMA, CTGF, and TGFBR2, however, upregulated the expression levels of antioxidants (SOD-1 and catalase) and LC3B in the lungs of BLM-treated mice. THSG treatment decreased the expression levels of fibronectin, Î±-SMA, and CTGF in TGF-Î²1-stimulated MRC-5 cells. Conversely, THSG increased the expression levels of SOD-1 and catalase. Furthermore, treatment of THSG profoundly reduced the TGF-Î²1-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, THSG restored TGF-Î²1-induced impaired autophagy, accompany by increasing the protein levels of LC3B-II and Beclin 1. Mechanism study indicated that THSG significantly reduced TGF-Î²1-induced increase of TGFBR2 expression and phosphorylation of Smad2/3, Akt, mTOR, and ERK1/2 in MRC-5 cells. These findings suggest that THSG may be considered as an anti-fibrotic drug for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electronic cigarette vaping with aged coils causes acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36195745/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been used widely as an alternative to conventional cigarettes and have become particularly popular among young adults. A growing body of evidence has shown that e-cigarettes are associated with acute lung injury and adverse effects in multiple other organs. Previous studies showed that high emissions of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) in aerosols were associated with increased usage of the same e-cigarette coils. However, the impact on lung function of using aged coils has not been reported. We investigated the relationship between coil age and acute lung injury in mice exposed to experimental vaping for 1 h (2 puffs/min, 100 ml/puff). The e-liquid contains propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (50:50, vol) only. The concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in the vaping aerosols increased with age of the nichrome coils starting at 1200 puffs. Mice exposed to e-cigarette aerosols produced from 1800, but not 0 or 900, puff-aged coils caused acute lung injury, increased lung wet/dry weight ratio, and induced lung inflammation (IL-6, TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², MIP-2). Exposure to vaping aerosols from 1800 puff-aged coils decreased heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation in mice compared to mice exposed to air or aerosols from new coils. In conclusion, we observed that the concentration of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) increased with repeated and prolonged usage of e-cigarette coils. Exposure to high levels of aldehyde in vaping aerosol was associated with acute lung injury in mice. These findings show significant risk of lung injury associated with prolonged use of e-cigarette devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic modifications have received increasing attention and have been shown to be extensively involved in kidney development and disease progression. Among them, the most common RNA modification, N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A), has been shown to dynamically and reversibly exert its functions in multiple ways, including splicing, export, decay and translation initiation efficiency to regulate mRNA fate. Moreover, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A has also been reported to exert biological effects by destabilizing base pairing to modulate various functions of RNAs. Most importantly, an increasing number of kidney diseases, such as renal cell carcinoma, acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, have been found to be associated with aberrant m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A patterns. In this review, we comprehensively review the critical roles of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A in kidney diseases and discuss the possibilities and relevance of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-targeted epigenetic therapy, with an integrated comprehensive description of the detailed alterations in specific loci that contribute to cellular processes that are associated with kidney diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tubular cell polyploidy protects from lethal acute kidney injury but promotes consequent chronic kidney disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36195583/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequent, often fatal and, for lack of specific therapies, can leave survivors with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We characterize the distribution of tubular cells (TC) undergoing polyploidy along AKI by DNA content analysis and single cell RNA-sequencing. Furthermore, we study the functional roles of polyploidization using transgenic models and drug interventions. We identify YAP1-driven TC polyploidization outside the site of injury as a rapid way to sustain residual kidney function early during AKI. This survival mechanism comes at the cost of senescence of polyploid TC promoting interstitial fibrosis and CKD in AKI survivors. However, targeting TC polyploidization after the early AKI phase can prevent AKI-CKD transition without influencing AKI lethality. Senolytic treatment prevents CKD by blocking repeated TC polyploidization cycles. These results revise the current pathophysiological concept of how the kidney responds to acute injury and identify a novel druggable target to improve prognosis in AKI survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A-Kinase Anchor Protein 1 deficiency causes mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse model of hyperoxia induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36263130/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Critically ill patients on supplemental oxygen therapy eventually develop acute lung injury (ALI). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during ALI perturbs the mitochondrial dynamics resulting in cellular damage. Genetic deletion of the mitochondrial A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (Akap1) in mice resulted in mitochondrial damage, Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, increased expression of mitophagy proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines, exacerbating hyperoxia-induced Acute Lung Injury (HALI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Despite a strong causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction and HALI, the mechanisms governing the disease progression at the transcriptome level is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was carried out using the lungs of Akap1 knockout (&lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;â/â&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) mice exposed to normoxia or 48 h of hyperoxia followed by quantitative real time PCR and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Western blot analysis assessed mitochondrial dysfunction, OXPHOS complex (I-V), apoptosis and antioxidant proteins. Mitochondrial enzymatic assays was used to measure the aconitase, fumarase, citrate synthase activities in isolated mitochondria from &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;â/â&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; vs. Wt mice exposed to hyperoxia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Transcriptome analysis of &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;â/â&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; exposed to hyperoxia reveals increases in transcripts encoding electron transport chain (ETC) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) proteins. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) shows enrichment of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation in &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;â/â&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Loss of AKAP1, coupled with oxidant injury, significantly decreases the activities of TCA enzymes. Mechanistically, a significant loss of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) phosphorylation at the protein kinase A (PKA) site Serine 637 (Ser637), decreases in Akt phosphorylation at Serine 437 (Ser47) and increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax indicate mitochondrial dysfunction. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels significantly increased in CD68 positive alveolar macrophages in &lt;em&gt;Akap1&lt;sup&gt;â/â&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lungs, suggesting a strong antioxidant response to hyperoxia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Overall these results suggest that AKAP1 overexpression and modulation of Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser637 is an important therapeutic strategy for acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The mitochondrial calcium uniporter of pulmonary type 2 cells determines severity of acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36192486/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute Lung Injury (ALI) due to inhaled pathogens causes high mortality. Underlying mechanisms are inadequately understood. Here, by optical imaging of live mouse lungs we show that a key mechanism is the viability of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering by the mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uniporter (MCU) in the lung&amp;rsquo;s surfactant-secreting, alveolar type 2 cells (AT2). The buffering increased mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and induced surfactant secretion in wild-type mice, but not in mice with AT2-specific MCU knockout. In the knockout mice, ALI due to intranasal LPS instillation caused severe pulmonary edema and mortality, which were mitigated by surfactant replenishment prior to LPS instillation, indicating surfactant&amp;rsquo;s protective effect against alveolar edema. In wild-type mice, intranasal LPS, or &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; decreased AT2 MCU. Loss of MCU abrogated buffering. The resulting mortality was reduced by spontaneous recovery of MCU expression, or by MCU replenishment. Enhancement of AT2 mitochondrial buffering, hence endogenous surfactant secretion, through MCU replenishment might be a therapy against ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aberrant methylation of Serpine1 mediates lung injury in neonatal mice prenatally exposed to intrauterine inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36183130/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/36183130/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Intrauterine inflammation (IUI) alters epigenetic modifications in offspring, leading to lung injury. However, the epigenetic mechanism underlying IUI-induced lung injury remains uncertain. In the present study, we aim to investigate the effect of IUI on lung development, and to identify the key molecule involved in this process and its epigenetic regulatory mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Serpine1 was upregulated in the lung tissue of neonatal mice with IUI. Intranasal delivery of Serpine1 siRNA markedly reversed IUI-induced lung injury. Serpine1 overexpression substantially promoted cell senescence of both human and murine lung epithelial cells, reflected by decreased cell proliferation and increased senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase activity, G0/G1 cell fraction, senescence marker, and oxidative and DNA damage marker expression. IUI decreased the methylation level of the Serpine1 promoter, and methylation of the promoter led to transcriptional repression of Serpine1. Furthermore, IUI promoted the expression of Tet1 potentially through TNF-Î±, while Tet1 facilitated the demethylation of Serpine1 promoter. DNA pull-down and ChIP assays revealed that the Serpine1 promoter was regulated by Rela and Hdac2. DNA demethylation increased the recruitment of Rela to the Serpine1 promoter and induced the release of Hdac2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Increased Serpine1 expression mediated by DNA demethylation causes lung injury in neonatal mice with IUI. Therefore, therapeutic interventions targeting Serpine1 may effectively prevent IUI-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblast growth factor 10 attenuates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by protecting against glycocalyx impairment and endothelial apoptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36183124/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The defects and imbalance in lung repair and structural maintenance contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), yet the molecular mechanisms that regulate lung repair process are so far incompletely understood. We hypothesized that cigarette smoking causes glycocalyx impairment and endothelial apoptosis in COPD, which could be repaired by the stimulation of fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10)/FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used immunostaining (immunohistochemical [IHC] and immunofluorescence [IF]) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the levels of glycocalyx components and endothelial apoptosis in animal models and in patients with COPD. We used the murine emphysema model and in vitro studies to determine the protective and reparative role of FGF10/FGFR1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Exposure to cigarette smoke caused endothelial glycocalyx impairment and emphysematous changes in murine models and human specimens. Pretreatment of FGF10 attenuated the development of emphysema and the shedding of glycocalyx components induced by CSE &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. However, FGF10 did not attenuate the emphysema induced by endothelial-specific killing peptide CGSPGWVRC-GG-&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;(KLAKLAK)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Mechanistically, FGF10 alleviated smoke-induced endothelial apoptosis and glycocalyx repair through FGFR1/ERK/SOX9/HS6ST1 signaling &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. FGF10 was shown to repair pulmonary glycocalyx injury and endothelial apoptosis, and attenuate smoke-induced COPD through FGFR1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results suggest that FGF10 may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy against COPD via endothelial repair and glycocalyx reconstitution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanisms of Biochanin A Alleviating PM2.5 Organic Extracts-Induced EMT of A549 Cells through the PI3K/Akt Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36181478/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epithelialâmesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important step in tumor progression, which enables tumor cells to acquire migration and invasion characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of biological biochanin A (BCA) in ameliorating fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) lung injury. The results showed that PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; could induce spindle-like changes in cell morphology, causing the ability of migration and invasion. However, they were significantly inhibited by BCA treatment (10/20/30 Î¼m). After BCA treatment, the release and transcription of chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor gene CXCR4 were inhibited, and the release of growth inducer TGF-Î²1 was significantly reduced. In addition, BCA promoted the transcription of E-cadherin and Î²-catenin, inhibiting the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin, and down-regulated the expression of MMP-2/9. We found that BCA effectively interfered with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activated by PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;. In conclusion, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; can induce EMT in lung cancer cells, and BCA may reverse this process by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Traumatic brain injury alters dendritic cell differentiation and distribution in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36183126/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pathophysiological consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) mediated secondary injury remain incompletely understood. In particular, the impact of TBI on the differentiation and maintenance of dendritic cells (DCs), which are regarded as the most professional antigen presenting cells of the immune system, remains completely unknown. Here, we report that DC-differentiation, maintenance and functions are altered on day 3 and day 7 after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Long bones, spleen, peripheral lymph nodes (pLNs), mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), liver, lungs, skin and blood were collected from mice with either moderate-level cortical impact (CCI) or sham on day 1, day 3 or day 7 after TBI. Bone marrow cells were isolated from the tibias and femurs of hind limb through flushing. Tissues were digested with Collagenase-D and DNase I. Skin biopsies were digested in the presence of liberase + DNase I. Single cell suspensions were made, red blood cells were lysed with Ammonium chloride (Stem Cell Technology) and subsequently filtered using a 70 Î¼M nylon mesh. DC subsets of the tissues and DC progenitors of the BM were identified through 10-color flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping studies. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were identified through H2DCFDA staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our studies identify that; (1) frequencies and absolute numbers of DCs in the spleen and BM are altered on day 3 and day 7 after TBI; (2) surface expression of key molecules involved in antigen presentation of DCs were affected on day 3 and day 7 after TBI; (3) distribution and functions of tissue-specific DC subsets of both circulatory and lymphatic systems were imbalanced following TBI; (4) early differentiation program of DCs, especially the commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to common DC progenitors (CDPs), were deregulated after TBI; and (5) intracellular ROS levels were reduced in DC progenitors and differentiated DCs on day 3 and day 7 after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our data demonstrate, for the first time, that TBI affects the distribution pattern of DCs and induces an imbalance among DC subsets in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. In addition, the current study demonstrates that TBI results in reduced levels of ROS in DCs on day 3 and day 7 after TBI, which may explain altered DC differentiation paradigm following TBI. A deeper understanding on the molecular mechanisms that contribute to DC defects following TBI would be essential and beneficial in treating infections in patients with acute central nervous system (CNS) injuries, such as TBI, stroke and spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-9a-5p alleviates ventilator-induced lung injury in rats by inhibiting the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway via CXCR4 expression downregulation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36193608/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36193608/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I establishment of (ventilator-induced acute lung injury) VILI rat model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used bioinformatics software to predict the target gene of miR-9a-5p, and verified the conclusion through double Luciferase Report experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) through lavage fluid recovery technology for experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Globally, Mechanical ventilation is the most commonly used short-term life support technology. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is an inflammatory injury caused by mechanical ventilation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as new gene regulators that play an important role in lung injury and inflammation. However, the role and mechanism of action of miR-9a-5p in VILI remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Herein, a rat model of VILI was established. To determine the expression levels of miR-9a-5p and CXCR4 mRNA, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were conducted. As well as western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence analyses, we determined the expression of CXCR4, SDF-1 and MAPK signaling pathway-related kinases. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining and the wet-dry ratio of the lung tissue were used to evaluate organ injury. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity measurements were performed to evaluate the inflammatory response. In addition, double luciferase reporter assays were used to verify the association between miR-9a-5p and CXCR4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The expression of miR-9a-5p was low, whereas that of CXCR4 was high in the lung tissues of VILI rats. The overexpression of miR-9a-5p alleviated the degree of pathological injury in the lung tissues of rats with VILI, downregulating inflammatory cytokine expression and MPO activity. In the VILI rat model, miR-9a-5p targeted the negative regulation of CXCR4, and CXCR4 overexpression to reverse the lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of miR-9a-5p overexpression in VILI rats. miR-9a-5p also inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal receptor-activated kinase (ERK), a protein related to the MAPK signaling pathway, by downregulating CXCR4 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; miR-9a-5p can hinder the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and reduce inflammatory reactions and lung injury in VILI rats through the targeted regulation of CXCR4 expression. Therefore, miR-9a-5p could serve as an intervention target to supply a new strategy for the care of VILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanodrugs alleviate acute kidney injury: Manipulate RONS at kidney</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AKI is a common clinical acute syndrome with high morbidity and mortality but without effective clinical drug available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hypoxia and accumulation of toxic substances are key pathological features of various heterogeneous AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive RONS is the core of the pathological mechanism of AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The development of nanodrugs is expected to achieve successful treatment in AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no clinical drugs available to treat acute kidney injury (AKI). Given the high prevalence and high mortality rate of AKI, the development of drugs to effectively treat AKI is a huge unmet medical need and a research hotspot. Although existing evidence fully demonstrates that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) burst at the AKI site is a major contributor to AKI progression, the heterogeneity, complexity, and unique physiological structure of the kidney make most antioxidant and anti-inflammatory small molecule drugs ineffective because of the lack of kidney targeting and side effects. Recently, nanodrugs with intrinsic kidney targeting through the control of size, shape, and surface properties have opened exciting prospects for the treatment of AKI. Many antioxidant nanodrugs have emerged to address the limitations of current AKI treatments. In this review, we systematically summarized for the first time about the emerging nanodrugs that exploit the pathological and physiological features of the kidney to overcome the limitations of traditional small-molecule drugs to achieve high AKI efficacy. First, we analyzed the pathological structural characteristics of AKI and the main pathological mechanism of AKI: hypoxia, harmful substance accumulation-induced RONS burst at the renal site despite the multifactorial initiation and heterogeneity of AKI. Subsequently, we introduced the strategies used to improve renal targeting and reviewed advances of nanodrugs for AKI: nano-RONS-sacrificial agents, antioxidant nanozymes, and nanocarriers for antioxidants and anti-inflammatory drugs. These nanodrugs have demonstrated excellent therapeutic effects, such as greatly reducing oxidative stress damage, restoring renal function, and low side effects. Finally, we discussed the challenges and future directions for translating nanodrugs into clinical AKI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LC3 lipidation is essential for TFEB activation during the lysosomal damage response to kidney injury</title>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensing and clearance of dysfunctional lysosomes is critical for cellular homeostasis. Here we show that transcription factor EB (TFEB)-a master transcriptional regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy-is activated during the lysosomal damage response, and its activation is dependent on the function of the ATG conjugation system, which mediates LC3 lipidation. In addition, lysosomal damage triggers LC3 recruitment on lysosomes, where lipidated LC3 interacts with the lysosomal calcium channel TRPML1, facilitating calcium efflux essential for TFEB activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence and importance of this TFEB activation mechanism in kidneys in a mouse model of oxalate nephropathy accompanying lysosomal damage. A proximal tubule-specific TFEB-knockout mouse exhibited progression of kidney injury induced by oxalate crystals. Together, our results reveal unexpected mechanisms of TFEB activation by LC3 lipidation and their physiological relevance during the lysosomal damage response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lycopene attenuates the inflammation and apoptosis in aristolochic acid nephropathy by targeting the Nrf2 antioxidant system</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36198206/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene improves renal dysfunction in mice with aristolochic acid nephropathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene inhibits oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the kidney of mice with aristolochic acid nephropathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway is critical to inhibit the development of renal inflammatory response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lycopene activates the Nrf2 antioxidant system and then inhibits apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lycopene (LYC) is a carotenoid, has antioxidant properties. This study investigated whether lycopene attenuates aristolochic acids (AAs) -induced chronic kidney disease. In this experiment, lycopene was used to intervene C57BL/6 mice with renal injury induced by aristolochic acid exposure. The histomorphological changes and serological parameters of the kidney were measured in order to assess the alleviating effect of lycopene on renal injury in aristolochic acid nephropathy. In vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to verify the main mechanism of action and drug targets of lycopene in improving aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) and by various experimental methods such as ELISA, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Western-blot and qRT-PCR. The results showed that oxidative stress injury was induced in the kidney of mice after AAI exposure, resulting in inflammatory response and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. The results showed that the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway was inhibited after AAI exposure. AAI induces oxidative stress injury in the kidney, which ultimately leads to inflammation and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. After LYC intervened in the body, it activated Nrf2 nuclear translocation and its downstream HO-1 and NQO1 antioxidant signaling pathways. LYC inhibited ROS production by renal tubular epithelial cells, and alleviated mitochondrial damage. LYC further modulated the TNF-Î±/NF-ÎºB signaling cascade, thereby reduced the accumulation of inflammatory factors in the renal interstitium. Moreover, LYC was able to up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2, down-regulate Bax expression and inhibit the activation of cleaved forms of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3, which finally attenuated the apoptosis of the mitochondrial pathway induced by AAI exposure. It was concluded that lycopene was able to activate the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway to maintain the homeostasis of renal oxidative stress and ultimately attenuated renal inflammatory response and apoptosis. These results suggested that lycopene can be used as a drug to relieve AAN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polysaccharides from Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury by modulating TLR4/COX-2/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polysaccharides from &lt;em&gt;Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum&lt;/em&gt; Diels et Gilg (SYQP) attenuated LPS-induced ALI in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYQP exerted anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYQP alleviated ALI by inhibiting TLR4/COX-2/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum&lt;/em&gt; Diels et Gilg (Sanyeqing, SYQ), a traditional herb native to China, has been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, febrile convulsions and dysentery. Previous studies have demonstrated the hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects of polysaccharides from SYQ (SYQP). However, the role of SYQP in acute lung injury (ALI) remained unknown. Our present study aimed to explore the protective effects of SYQP in ALI and explained its underlying mechanism. In vivo, Balb/c mice were intragastrically administered with SYQP and dexamethasone (DXMS) for 14 days which were intratracheally instilled (IT) with LPS at the last day. In vitro, A549 cells were pretreated with SYQP, DXMS or TAK-242, following by LPS stimulation for 24 h. The histopathological results showed that SYQP remarkably alleviated pulmonary macrophage infiltration and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels. Additionally, SYQP evidently suppressed wet/dry (W/D) ratio of lung and white blood cells (WBC) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Moreover, SYQP markedly reduced TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1Î² and COX-2 levels both in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, SYQP significantly attenuated oxidative stress through upregulating the levels of SOD and GSH-Px and downregulating the expressions of MDA and LDH in vivo, which was confirmed by in vitro results that SYQP could increase SOD activity and decrease MDA and NO contents. Importantly, a decline in protein expressions of TLR4, COX-2, NF-ÎºB p50, phospho-NF-ÎºB p65 and phospho-IÎºB-Î± was detected in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our results demonstrated that SYQP ameliorated LPS-induced ALI by alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress via attenuating TLR4/COX-2/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chlorogenic acid enhances alveolar macrophages phagocytosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome by activating G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR 37)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36194973/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36194973/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impaired alveolar macrophages phagocytosis can contribute to pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and negatively impacts clinical outcomes. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound with potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant bioactivities. Studies have shown that CGA plays a protective role in ARDS, however, the precise protective mechanism of CGA against ARDS, is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate whether CGA enhances alveolar macrophages phagocytosis to attenuate lung injury during ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (100 Î¼g/ml for 24 h) and treated with CGA (100, 200, and 400 Î¼M CGA for 1 h) to measure pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, GPR37 expression and macrophages phagocytosis. Mouse models of ARDS induced by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) surgery were treated with CGA (100 or 200 mg/kg) to investigate lung inflammatory injury and alveolar macrophages phagocytosis. Computational modeling was performed to examine potential binding sites of G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) with CGA, and the results were validated by interfering with the binding sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Result&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, CGA notably ameliorated inflammatory response and increased phagocytosis in lipopolysaccharides-induced RAW264.7 cells. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, CGA administration significantly alleviated lung inflammatory injury, decreased the bacteria load in the lung, promoted alveolar macrophages phagocytosis and improved the survival rate in mice with CLP-induced ARDS. Moreover, CGA markedly upregulated the expression of GPR37 &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. However, the protective effect of CGA against ARDS were reversed after silencing the expression of GPR37.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CGA has a protective effect against ARDS and may enhance alveolar macrophages phagocytosis and attenuate lung inflammatory injury by upregulating GPR37 expression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating Myeloid Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles as Mediators of Indirect Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150169/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood-borne myeloid cells, neutrophils and monocytes, play a central role in the development of indirect acute lung injury (ALI) during sepsis and non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). By contrast, the contribution of circulating myeloid cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) to ALI is unknown, despite acute increases in their numbers during sepsis and SIRS. Here, we investigated the direct role of circulating myeloid-EVs in ALI using a mouse isolated perfused lung system and a human cell coculture model of pulmonary vascular inflammation consisting of lung microvascular endothelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Total and immunoaffinity-isolated myeloid (CD11b+) and platelet (CD41+) EVs were prepared from the plasma of i.v. LPS-injected endotoxemic donor mice and transferred directly into recipient lungs. Two-hour perfusion of lungs with unfractionated EVs from a single donor induced pulmonary edema formation and increased perfusate levels of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), consistent with lung injury. These responses were abolished in the lungs of monocyte-depleted mice. The isolated myeloid- but not platelet-EVs produced a similar injury response and the acute intravascular release of proinflammatory cytokines and endothelial injury markers. In the in vitro human coculture model, human myeloid (CD11b+) but not platelet (CD61+) EVs isolated from LPS-stimulated whole blood induced acute proinflammatory cytokine production and endothelial activation. These findings implicate circulating myeloid-EVs as acute mediators of pulmonary vascular inflammation and edema, suggesting an alternative therapeutic target for attenuation of indirect ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal Microbiota-derived Propionic Acid Protects against Zinc Oxide Nanoparticle-induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150095/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of nanotechnology, the risks of accidental and/or occupational exposure to zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) are increasing. Inhalation of ZnONPs induces metal fume fever in humans and acute lung injury (ALI) in animal models. Although the intestinal microbiota is considered an important modulator of various diseases, the role and mechanism of intestinal microbiota in the pathology of ZnONP-induced ALI are unclear. Herein, we established an intratracheal instillation of a ZnONP-induced ALI mouse model and found that the inhalation of ZnONPs caused ALI along with a perturbation of intestinal flora. Antibiotic cocktail treatment-mediated depletion of intestinal microbiota aggravated ZnONP-induced ALI, and in contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation-mediated restoration of intestinal microbiota exerted the opposite effects. A decrease in short-chain fatty acids, the intestinal microbiota-derived metabolites in the plasma-in particular, acetic acid and propionic acid-occurred after exposure to ZnONPs. It is important to note that supplementation with propionic acid, but not acetic acid, ameliorated ZnONP-induced ALI. We also showed that the source of inflammatory cytokines might partially be the infiltration of macrophages. Supplementation with propionic acid was found to act on macrophages through the receptor GPR43, because knockdown of GPR43 sharply reversed the protective effects of propionic acid during the ZnONP-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress in both primary alveolar macrophages and RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines. Altogether, a novel gut-lung axis mechanism is revealed in which intestinal microbiota and their derived metabolite propionic acid play protective roles against ZnONP-induced ALI and suggest that fecal microbiota transplantation and supplementation with propionic acid are potential remedy strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chitinase 3 like 1 contributes to the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling in pulmonary hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35951428/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35951428/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1) is the prototypic chitinase-like protein mediating inflammation, cell proliferation, and tissue remodeling. Limited data suggest CHI3L1 is elevated in human pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and is associated with disease severity. Despite its importance as a regulator of injury/repair responses, the relationship between CHI3L1 and pulmonary vascular remodeling is not well understood. We hypothesize that CHI3L1 and its signaling pathways contribute to the vascular remodeling responses that occur in pulmonary hypertension (PH). We examined the relationship of plasma CHI3L1 levels and severity of PH in patients with various forms of PH, including group 1 PAH and group 3 PH, and found that circulating levels of serum CHI3L1 were associated with worse hemodynamics and correlated directly with mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. We also used transgenic mice with constitutive knockout and inducible overexpression of CHI3L1 to examine its role in hypoxia-, monocrotaline-, and bleomycin-induced models of pulmonary vascular disease. In all 3 mouse models of pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary hypertensive responses were mitigated in CHI3L1-null mice and accentuated in transgenic mice that overexpress CHI3L1. Finally, CHI3L1 alone was sufficient to induce pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation, inhibit pulmonary vascular endothelial cell apoptosis, induce the loss of endothelial barrier function, and induce endothelial-mesenchymal transition. These findings demonstrate that CHI3L1 and its receptors play an integral role in pulmonary vascular disease pathobiology and may offer a target for the treatment of PAH and PH associated with fibrotic lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selenium-enriched soybean peptides pretreatment attenuates lung injury in mice induced by fine particulate matters (PM2.5) through inhibition of TLR4/NF-ÎºB/IÎºBÎ± signaling pathway and inflammasome generation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35979800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to identify and prepare peptides from selenium (Se)-enriched soybeans and determine whether dietary Se-enriched soybean peptides (Se-SPep) could inhibit lung injury in mice induced by fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups. The mice in the prevention groups were pretreated with 378 mg kg-1 of Se-SPep, soybean peptides (SPep), and Se-enriched soybean protein (Se-SPro), respectively, for four weeks. The mice in the PM2.5 exposure group received concentrated PM2.5 (15 Î¼g per day mice) for 1 h daily from the third week for two weeks. The results showed that the leukocyte and cytokine (IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î±) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the PM2.5 exposure group were higher than those in the control group. Se-SPep pretreatment decreased the IL-1Î², IL-6, and TNF-Î± levels compared with the PM2.5 exposure group. Additionally, Se-SPep pretreatment inhibited TLR4/NF-ÎºB/IÎºBÎ± and NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 protein expression in the lungs. In conclusion, Se-SPep pretreatment may protect the lungs of the mice against PM2.5-induced inflammation, suggesting that Se-SPep represents a potential preventative agent to inhibit PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses exploit host cell machinery to support their replication. Defining the cellular proteins and processes required for a virus during infection is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of virally induced disease and designing host-directed therapeutics. Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screening in lung epithelial cells infected with the PR/8/NS1-GFP virus and use GFPhi cell as a unique screening marker to identify host factors that inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We discovered that APOE affects influenza virus infection both in vitro and in vivo. Cell deficiency in APOE conferred substantially increased susceptibility to IAV; mice deficient in APOE manifested more severe lung pathology, increased virus load, and decreased survival rate. Mechanistically, lack of cell-produced APOE results in impaired cell cholesterol homeostasis, enhancing influenza virus attachment. Thus, we identified a previously unrecognized role of APOE in restraining IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Csf2ra deletion attenuates acute lung injuries induced by intratracheal inoculation of aerosolized ricin in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36203597/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific therapeutics are not available for acute lung injury (ALI) induced by ricin toxin (RT). Inhibiting the host immune response in the course of pulmonary ricinosis is hypothesized to be of benefit and can be achieved by impairing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling, thereby reducing the pro-inflammatory response to exogenous foreign body invasion. However, it is unknown whether mice with impaired GM-CSF signaling can survive after RT inhalation. To test this, colony stimulating factor 2 receptor alpha (&lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt;) knockout (KO) mice that lack GM-CSF signaling and wild-type (WT) mice models of intratracheal exposure to a lethal dose (2Ã LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of RT were established. Survival was greater in &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice 21 days after RT inhalation compared with WT mice. Highly co-expressed genes that probably attenuated the pro-inflammatory response in the lung of &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice were identified. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that transcriptome changes involved mostly inflammation-related genes after RT exposure in both &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice and WT mice. However, the activity levels of pro-inflammatory pathways, such as the TNF signaling pathway and NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, in &lt;em&gt;Csf2ra&lt;/em&gt; KO mice were significantly decreased and the degree of neutrophil chemotaxis and recruitment inhibited after RT-exposure relative to WT mice. RT-qPCR and flow cytometry validated results of RNA-Seq analysis. This work provides potential avenues for host-directed therapeutic applications that can mitigate the severity of ALI-induced by RT.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition Is Protective in Hyperoxia-Induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36193076/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Studies have linked severe hyperoxia, or prolonged exposure to very high oxygen levels, with worse clinical outcomes. This study investigated the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in hyperoxia-induced lung injury at very high oxygen levels (&amp;gt;95%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Effects of severe hyperoxia (100% oxygen) were studied in mice with genetically inhibited EGFR and wild-type littermates. Despite the established role of EGFR in lung repair, EGFR inhibition led to improved survival and reduced acute lung injury, which prompted an investigation into this protective mechanism. Endothelial EGFR genetic knockout did not confer protection. EGFR inhibition led to decreased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) and decreased terminal dUTP nick end labeling- (TUNEL-) positive staining in alveolar epithelial cells and reduced ERK activation, which suggested reduced apoptosis in vivo. EGFR inhibition decreased hyperoxia (95%)-induced apoptosis and ERK in murine alveolar epithelial cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and CRISPR-mediated EGFR deletion reduced hyperoxia-induced apoptosis and ERK in human alveolar epithelial cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In conditions of severe hyperoxia (&amp;gt;95% for &amp;gt;24 h), EGFR inhibition led to improved survival, decreased lung injury, and reduced cell death. These findings further elucidate the complex role of EGFR in acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work defines a protective role of EGFR inhibition to decrease apoptosis in lung injury induced by 100% oxygen. This further characterizes the complex role of EGFR in acute lung injury and outlines a novel hyperoxia-induced cell death pathway that warrants further study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFN-Î³ transforms the transcriptomic landscape and triggers myeloid cell hyperresponsiveness to cause lethal lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36203588/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory disease that is associated with high mortality but no specific treatment. Our understanding of initial events that trigger ARDS pathogenesis is limited. We have developed a mouse model of inflammatory lung injury by influenza and methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) coinfection plus daily antibiotic therapy. Using this pneumonic ARDS model, here we show that IFN-Î³ receptor signaling drives inflammatory cytokine storm and lung tissue damage. By single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, we demonstrate that IFN-Î³ signaling induces a transcriptional shift in airway immune cells, particularly by upregulating macrophage and monocyte expression of genes associated with inflammatory diseases. Further evidence from conditional knockout mouse models reveals that IFN-Î³ receptor signaling in myeloid cells, particularly CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mononuclear phagocytes, directly promotes TNF-Î± hyperproduction and inflammatory lung damage. Collectively, the findings from this study, ranging from cell-intrinsic gene expression to overall disease outcome, demonstrate that influenza-induced IFN-Î³ triggers myeloid cell hyperresponsiveness to MRSA, thereby leading to excessive inflammatory response and lethal lung damage during coinfection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protease-activated receptor 2 promotes clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection by inducing cAMP-Rac1 signaling in alveolar macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36204227/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient phagocytosis of pathogens by the innate immune system during infectious injury is vital for restoring tissue integrity. Impaired phagocytosis, such as in the case of infection with &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, a broad-spectrum antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterium, can lead to a life threatening lung disorder, acute lung injury (ALI). Evidence indicates that loss of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) impaired &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; clearance leading to non-resolvable ALI, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we focused on the alveolar macrophages (AMs), the predominant population of lung-resident macrophages involved in sensing bacteria, to understand their role in PAR2-mediated phagocytosis of &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. We found that upon binding &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, PAR2-expressing but not PAR2-null AMs had increased cAMP levels, which activated Rac1 through protein kinase A. Activated Rac1 increased actin-rich protrusions to augment the phagocytosis of &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. Administration of liposomes containing constitutively active Rac1 into PAR2-null mice lungs rescued phagocytosis and enhanced the survival of PAR2-null mice from pneumonia. These studies showed that PAR2 drives the cAMP-Rac1 signaling cascade that activates &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; phagocytosis in AMs, thereby preventing death from bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFN- Î³ Is Protective in Cytokine Release Syndrome-associated Extrapulmonary Acute Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms by which excessive systemic activation of adaptive T lymphocytes, as in cytokine release syndrome (CRS), leads to innate immune cell-mediated acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome, often in the absence of any infection, remains unknown. Here, we investigated the roles of IFN-Î³ and IL-17A, key T-cell cytokines significantly elevated in patients with CRS, in the immunopathogenesis of CRS-induced extrapulmonary ALI. CRS was induced in wild-type (WT), IL-17A- and IFN-Î³ knockout (KO) human leukocyte antigen-DR3 transgenic mice with 10 Î¼g of the superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, given intraperitoneally. Several ALI parameters, including gene expression profiling in the lungs, were studied 4, 24, or 48 hours later. Systemic T-cell activation with staphylococcal enterotoxin B resulted in robust upregulation of several chemokines, S100A8/A9, matrix metalloproteases, and other molecules implicated in tissue damage, granulocyte as well as agranulocyte adhesion, and diapedesis in the lungs as early as 4 hours, which was accompanied by subsequent neutrophil/eosinophil lung infiltration and severe ALI in IFN-Î³ KO mice. These pathways were significantly underexpressed in IL-17A KO mice, which manifested mildest ALI and intermediate in WT mice. Neutralization of IFN-Î³ worsened ALI in WT and IL-17A KO mice, whereas neutralizing IL-17A did not mitigate lung injury in IFN-Î³ KO mice, suggesting a dominant protective role for IFN-Î³ in ALI and that IL-17A is dispensable. Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, increased ALI severity in WT mice. Thus, our study identified novel mechanisms of ALI in CRS and its differential modulation by IFN-Î³ and IL-17A.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Hippo pathway and its correlation with acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36052554/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant clinical complication with a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality, for which therapeutic options remain limited. The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway implicated in cell proliferation, dedifferentiation, and apoptosis via phosphorylation and inactivation of its downstream effectors Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Recent studies have revealed that the Hippo pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and repair of AKI. The Hippo pathway can mediate renal dysfunction through modulation of mitochondrial apoptosis under AKI conditions. Transient activation of YAP/TAZ in the acute phase of AKI may benefit renal recovery and regeneration, whereas persistent activation of YAP/TAZ in severe AKI may lead to maladaptive repair and transition to chronic kidney disease. This review aims to summarize recent findings on the associations between the Hippo pathway and AKI and to identify new therapeutic targets and strategies for AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of tocilizumab and dexamethasone on the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of antioxidants in the lungs in oleic acid-induced ARDS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36115998/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening disease caused by the induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs. There is a dearth of drug applications that can be used to prevent cytokine storms in ARDS treatment. This study was designed to investigate the effects of tocilizumab and dexamethasone on oxidative stress, antioxidant parameters, and cytokine storms in acute lung injury caused by oleic acid in rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Adult male rats were divided into five groups: the CN (healthy rats, n = 6), OA (oleic acid administration, n = 6), OA + TCZ-2 (oleic acid and tocilizumab at 2 mg/kg, n = 6), OA + TCZ-4 (oleic acid and tocilizumab at 4 mg/kg, n = 6), and OA + DEX-10 (oleic acid and dexamethasone at 10 mg/kg, n = 6) groups. All animals were euthanized after treatment for histopathological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, PCR, and SEM analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Expressions of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6, and IL-8 cytokines in rats with acute lung injury induced by oleic acid were downregulated in the TCZ and DEX groups compared to the OA group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The MDA level in lung tissues was statistically lower in the OA + TCZ-4 group compared to the OA group. It was further determined that SOD, GSH, and CAT levels were decreased in the OA group and increased in the TCZ and DEX groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Histopathological findings such as thickening of the alveoli, hyperemia, and peribronchial cell infiltration were found to be similar when lung tissues of the TCZ and DEX groups were compared to the control group. With SEM imaging of the lung tissues, it was found that the alveolar lining layer had become indistinct in the OA, OA + TCZ-2, and OA + TCZ-4 groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In this model of acute lung injury caused by oleic acid, tocilizumab and dexamethasone were effective in preventing cytokine storms by downregulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6, and IL-8. Against the downregulation of antioxidant parameters such as SOD and GSH in the lung tissues caused by oleic acid, tocilizumab and dexamethasone upregulated them and showed protective effects against cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liang-Ge decoction ameliorates acute lung injury in septic model rats through reducing inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and modulating host metabolism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36188538/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liang-Ge decoction (LG) has been used in the treatment of early stage of spesis and can ameliorate sepsis-associated lung injury. However, the mechanism of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury remains unknown. In this study, we established a rat model of sepsis-associated lung injury using the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method, and investigated the therapeutic effects of LG on lung injury in rats with sepsis. In addition, the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury model rats were evaluated. Besides, untargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the regulation of metabolites in rats with sepsis-associated lung injury after LG treatment. Our results showed that LG could decrease the wet/dry (W/D) ratio in lung and the total cell count and total protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in septic model rats. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining showed that LG reduced the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells in lung. In addition, LG treatmment down-regulated the gene and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokins in lung tissue and BALF. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were increased and the level of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) was decreased in lung tissue homogenate in septic model rats after LG treament. Moreover, the numbers of apoptotic cells in lung were reduced and the activity of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) in BALF was decreased in septic model rats after LG treament. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that LG treatment affected the levels of 23 metabolites in lung in septic model rats such as citric acid, methionine, threonine, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, and inositol, these metabolites were associated with the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism and citrate cycle (TCA cycle) pathways. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the therapeutic effetcts of LG on sepsis-associated lung injury model rats. Moreover, LG could inhibit the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis and regulate metabolites related to glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism and TCA cycle in lung in sepsis-associated lung injury model rats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA Î±1 interacts with TLR4 and SFKs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA Î±1 restricts LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NKA Î±1&lt;sup&gt;+/â&lt;/sup&gt; mice injected with LPS show more lung injury and lower survival rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na/K-ATPase (NKA), besides its ion transporter function, is a signal transducer by regulating Src family kinases (SFK). The signaling NKA contributes to oxidized LDL-induced macrophage foam cell formation and interacts with TLR4. However, its role in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced signaling and glycolytic switch in macrophages remains unclear. Using peritoneal macrophages from NKA Î±1 haploinsufficient mice (NKA Î±1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;), we found that NKA Î±1 haploinsufficiency led to enhanced LPS-stimulated NF-ÎºB pathway, ROS signaling, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS resulted in more severe lung inflammation and injury with lower survival rate in NKA Î±1&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Additionally, LPS induced a higher extent of the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Mechanistically, NKA Î±1 interacted with TLR4 and Lyn. The presence of NKA Î±1 in this complex attenuated Lyn activation by LPS, which subsequently restricted the downstream ROS and NF-ÎºB signaling. In conclusion, we demonstrated that NKA Î±1 suppresses LPS-induced macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling through Lyn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rectal administration of butyrate ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis in mice through induction of hepatocyte growth factor in the colon via the HDAC-PPARÎ³ pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36116532/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butyrate, given by oral administration or in drinking water, has been shown to improve experimental pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in mice despite of very low bioavailability. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics disconnection attracts us to explore its anti-PF mechanism in view of the intestinal expression of anti-PF factors. In bleomycin-induced PF in mice, rectal administration of butyrate (500 mg/kg) exhibited a significant anti-PF effect, with a maximum plasma concentration largely lower than the minimum effective concentration (1 mM) at which butyrate inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory factors by lung epithelial cells and the production of extracellular matrix by lung fibroblasts. The rectal administration of butyrate significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the colons of PF mice, but showed no significant effect on the mRNA expression of HGF in the small intestines, lungs and livers. In colon epithelial cells, the monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHC) abrogated butyrate-induced expression of HGF, indicating that butyrate functions through entering into cells. Butyrate showed no significant effect on the histone acetylation in the promoter region of HGF, suggesting that it promotes HGF expression not by directly affecting the histone deacetylation of HGF but by other pathways. GW9662, the inhibitor of PPARÎ³, significantly attenuated the effect of butyrate to promote the mRNA expression of HGF. Butyrate was able to enhance the acetylation of PPARÎ³, and a targeted mutation of lysine at the position 240 (K240) of PPARÎ³ markedly diminished the induction of butyrate on HGF expression, suggesting that butyrate promoted HGF expression in colon epithelial cells by upregulating PPARÎ³ K240 acetylation. In summary, rectal administration of butyrate promotes the expression of HGF in colonic epithelial cells through upregulating PPARÎ³ acetylation via inhibition of HDAC activity. The findings of the present study provide a reasonable explanation for the anti-PF action mode of butyrate based on the &amp;rsquo;lung-gut axis&amp;rsquo;, and found that intestine-derived butyrate and HGF may be involved in the modulation of the occurrence and progression of PF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A potential new pathway for heparin treatment of sepsis-induced lung injury: inhibition of pulmonary endothelial cell pyroptosis by blocking hMGB1-LPS-induced caspase-11 activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36189354/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a significant cause of mortality in critically ill patients. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a leading cause of death in these patients. Endothelial cells exposed to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can progress into pyroptosis, a programmed lysis of cell death triggered by inflammatory caspases. It is characterized by lytic cell death induced by the binding of intracellular LPS to caspases 4/5 in human cells and caspase-11 in mouse cells. In mice,caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis plays an important role in endotoxemia. HMGB1 released into the plasma binds to LPS and is internalized into lysosomes in endothelial cells via the advanced glycation end product receptor. In the acidic lysosomal environment, HMGB1 permeates the phospholipid bilayer, which is followed by the leakage of LPS into the cytoplasm and the activation of caspase-11. Heparin is an anticoagulant widely applied in the treatment of thrombotic disease. Previous studies have found that heparin could block caspase-11-dependent inflammatory reactions, decrease sepsis-related mortality, and reduce ALI, independent of its anticoagulant activity. Heparin or modified heparin with no anticoagulant property could inhibit the alarmin HMGB1-LPS interactions, minimize LPS entry into the cytoplasm, and thus blocking caspase-11 activation. Heparin has been studied in septic ALI, but the regulatory mechanism of pulmonary endothelial cell pyroptosis is still unclear. In this paper, we discuss the potential novel role of heparin in the treatment of septic ALI from the unique mechanism of pulmonary endothelial cell pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astragaloside IV regulates the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to inhibit PM2.5-mediated lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36115280/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5-induced lung injury was associated with the ferroptosis and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV pre-treatment attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury by inhibiting ferroptosis via Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV is a potential drug for prevention of PM2.5-induced respiratory disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Exposure to PM2.5 will increase the risk of respiratory disease and increase the burden of social health care. Astragaloside â£ (Ast-IV) is one of the main biologically active substances form Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus, which owns various pharmacological effects. Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by accumulation of iron-dependent lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is not clear whether there are typical features of ferroptosis in PM2.5-induced lung injury. This study investigates whether PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice has a special form of ferroptosis and the specific protective mechanism of Ast-IV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjects and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Forty-two male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 7 per group): NS group (normal saline), Ast group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg), PM2.5 group, Ast-L group (Ast-IV 50 mg/kg + PM2.5), Ast-H group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + PM2.5) and Era group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + erastin 20 mg/kg + PM2.5). Mice were pre-treated with Ast-IV intraperitoneally for three days. Then, PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) was given by non-invasive tracheal instillation to induce lung injury. The ferroptosis&amp;rsquo; agonist erastin was used to verify the mechanism of Ast-IV anti-ferroptosis. 12 h after PM2.5 stimulation, the mice were euthanized. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum were collected for oxidative stress and cytokine determination. Lung tissues were collected for glutathione (GSH), tissue iron content, histology, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Ast-IV reduced the lung wet-dry ratio and the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and interleukin 1Î² (IL-1Î²) in serum. Ast-IV could also improve the oxidative stress level in BALF, restore the GSH level in the lung tissue, and reduce the iron content in the lung tissue. Western blot outcomes revealed that Ast-IV regulated the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to protect PM2.5-mediated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The protective effect of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice might be related to the inhibition of ferroptosis in lung tissue. Anti-ferroptosis might be a new mechanism of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>D-tagatose protects against oleic acid-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in rats by activating PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36189316/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier, resulting in severe alveolar edema and inflammation. D-tagatose (TAG) is a low-calorie fructose isomer with diverse biological activities whose role in ARDS has never been explored. We found that TAG protects lung tissues from injury in the oleic acid-induced rat model of ARDS. Seventeen male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups: Sham (n = 5), ARDS (n = 6), and TAG + ARDS (n = 6). The treatment groups were injected with oleic acid to induce ARDS, and the TAG + ARDS group was given TAG 3 days before the induction. After the treatments, the effect of TAG was evaluated by blood gas analysis and observing the gross and histological structure of the lung. The results showed that TAG significantly improved the oxygenation function, reduced the respiratory acidosis and the inflammatory response. TAG also improved the vascular permeability in ARDS rats and promoted the differentiation of alveolar type II cells, maintaining the stability of the alveolar structure. This protective effect of TAG on the lung may be achieved by activating the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, TAG protects against oleic acid-induced ARDS in rats, suggesting a new clinical strategy for treating the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting FoxO transcription factors with HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of osteoarthritis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36109140/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; Osteoarthritis (OA) features ageing-related defects in cellular homeostasis mechanisms in articular cartilage. These defects are associated with suppression of forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors. FoxO1 or FoxO3 deficient mice show early onset OA while FoxO1 protects against oxidative stress in chondrocytes and promotes expression of autophagy genes and the essential joint lubricant proteoglycan 4 (PRG4). The objective of this study was to identify small molecules that can increase FoxO1 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We constructed a reporter cell line with FoxO1 promoter sequences and performed high-throughput screening (HTS) of the Repurposing, Focused Rescue and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) library . Hits from the HTS were validated and function was assessed in human chondrocytes, meniscus cells and synoviocytes and following administration to mice. The most promising hit, the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) panobinostat was tested in a murine OA model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Among the top hits were HDACI and testing in human chondrocytes, meniscus cells and synoviocytes showed that panobinostat was the most promising compound as it increased the expression of autophagy genes and PRG4 while suppressing the basal and IL-1Î² induced expression of inflammatory mediators and extracellular matrix degrading enzymes. Intraperitoneal administration of panobinostat also suppressed the expression of mediators of OA pathogenesis induced by intra-articular injection of IL-1Î². In a murine OA model, panobinostat reduced the severity of histological changes in cartilage, synovium and subchondral bone and improved pain behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Panobinostat has a clinically relevant activity profile and is a candidate for OA symptom and structure modification.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin alleviates LPS-induced pulmonary injury and edema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin protects against PMVECs hyperpermeability via preventing the loss of adherens junctions and tight junctions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress by regulating mitochondrial function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linagliptin attenuates PMVECs barrier dysfunction via activating the Epac1/AKT signaling axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) barrier dysfunction is a main pathophysiological feature of sepsis-related acute lung injury (ALI). This study aimed to investigate whether the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor linagliptin could protect against LPS-induced PMVECs barrier disruption and its underlying molecular mechanisms. A classical ALI animal model and LPS-treated PMVECs were applied and all were treated with or without linagliptin. Cellular experiments demonstrated that linagliptin could mitigate LPS-induced PMVECs hyperpermeability and intercellular junction (VE-cadherin, Î²-catenin, and ZO-1) disruption in a dose-dependent manner. Correspondingly, it was observed that linagliptin pretreatment distinctly relieved LPS-induced lung injury, oxidative stress, and pulmonary edema in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of oxidative stress by linagliptin may be achieved by reversing impaired mitochondrial function. Mechanistically, linagliptin administration promoted the activation of the Epac1 pathway and its downstream AKT pathway, while inhibition of the Epac1/Akt signaling pathway significantly alleviated the above-mentioned protective effect of linagliptin on the PMVECs barrier. Taken together, these data suggest that linagliptin can effectively reserve PMVECs barrier dysfunction and inhibit oxidative stress to protect against ALI via activating the Epac1/AKT signaling pathway, and thus may become a potential clinical therapeutic strategy for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016%2822%2900610-4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A protein encoded by circular ZNF609 RNA induces acute kidney injury by activating the AKT/mTOR-autophagy pathway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy plays a crucial role in the development and progression of ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the function and mechanism of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the regulation of autophagy in ischemic AKI remain unexplored. Herein, we find that circ-ZNF609, originating from the ZNF609 locus, is highly expressed in the kidney after ischemia/reperfusion injury, and urinary circ-ZNF609 is a moderate predictor for AKI in heart disease patients. Overexpression of circ-ZNF609 can activate AKT3/mTOR signaling and induce autophagy flux impairment and cell apoptosis while inhibiting proliferation in HK-2 cells, which is blocked by silencing circ-ZNF609. Mechanistically, circ-ZNF609 encodes a functional protein consisting of 250 amino acids (aa), termed ZNF609-250aa, the overexpression of which can activate AKT3/mTOR signaling and induce autophagy flux impairment and cell apoptosis in HK-2 cells in vitro and in AKI kidneys in vivo. The blockade of AKT and mTOR signaling with pharmacological inhibitors is capable of reversing ZNF609-250aa-induced autophagy flux impairment and cell apoptosis in HK-2 cells. The present study demonstrates that highly expressed circ-ZNF609-encoded ZNF609-250aa induces cell apoptosis and AKI by impairing the autophagy flux via an AKT/mTOR-dependent mechanism. These findings imply that targeting circ-ZNF609 may be a novel therapy for ischemic AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 exposure altered gut microbiome and influences the balance of Th17/Treg cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The changes of gut microbiome and the imbalance of Th17/Treg cell are critical mechanism of PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The administration of Probiotics regulating Th17/Treg cell balance and gut microbiome attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imbalance of intestinal microbiota and inflammatory response is crucial in the development of lung injury induced by PM2.5. In recent years, probiotics have attracted great attention for their health benefits in inflammatory diseases and regulating intestinal balance, but their intricate mechanisms need further experiments to elucidate. In our research, a rat lung damage model induced by PM2.5 exposure in real environment was established to explore the protective properties of probiotics on PM2.5 exposure injury and its related mechanism. The results indicated that compared with the AF control group, rats in the PM2.5 group gained weight slowly, ate less and had yellow hair. The results of pathological and immunohistochemical examinations showed that the inflammatory infiltration of lung tissue was alleviated after probiotic treatment. The Lung function results also showed the improvement effects of probiotics administration. In addition, probiotics could promote the balance of Th17 and Treg cells, inhibit cytokines expression (TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1Î², IL-17A), and increase the concentration of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10, TGF-Î²). In addition, 16 S rRNA sequence analysis showed that probiotic treatment could reduce microbiota abundance and diversity, increase the abundance of possible beneficial bacteria, and decrease the abundance of bacteria associated with inflammation. In general, probiotic intervention was found to have preventive effects on the occurrence of PM2.5 induced pathological injury, and the mechanism was associate with to the inhibition of inflammatory response, regulation of Th17/Treg balance and maintenance of intestinal internal environment stability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lack of ZNF365 Drives Senescence and Exacerbates Experimental Lung Fibrosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by aberrant activation of the alveolar epithelium, the expansion of the fibroblast population, and the accumulation of extracellular matrix. Global gene expression of human lung fibroblasts stimulated with TGFÎ²-1, a strong fibrotic mediator revealed the overexpression of ZNF365, a zinc finger protein implicated in cell cycle control and telomere stabilization. We evaluated the expression and localization of ZNF365 in IPF lungs and in the fibrotic response induced by bleomycin in WT and deficient mice of the orthologous gene &lt;em&gt;Zfp365&lt;/em&gt;. In IPF, ZNF365 was overexpressed and localized in fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and alveolar epithelium. Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis showed an upregulation of Zfp365 localized in lung epithelium and stromal cell populations. &lt;em&gt;Zfp365&lt;/em&gt; KO mice developed a significantly higher fibrotic response compared with WT mice by morphology and hydroxyproline content. Silencing &lt;em&gt;ZNF365&lt;/em&gt; in human lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells induced a significant reduction of growth rate and increased senescence markers, including Senescence Associated Î² Galactosidase activity, p53, p21, and the histone variant Î³H2AX. Our findings demonstrate that ZNF365 is upregulated in IPF and experimental lung fibrosis and suggest a protective role since its absence increases experimental lung fibrosis mechanistically associated with the induction of cell senescence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of radiation biodosimetry has changed recently, and a paradigm shift for using molecular technologies of omic platforms in addition to cytogenetic techniques has been observed. In our study, we have used a nonhuman primate model to investigate the impact of a supralethal dose of 12 Gy radiation on alterations in the lung transcriptome. We used 6 healthy and 32 irradiated animal samples to delineate radiation-induced changes. We also used a medical countermeasure, Î³-tocotrienol (GT3), to observe any changes. We demonstrate significant radiation-induced changes in the lung transcriptome for total-body irradiation (TBI) and partial-body irradiation (PBI). However, no major influence of GT3 on radiation was noted in either comparison. Several common signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, GADD45, and p53, were upregulated in both exposures. TBI activated DNA-damage-related pathways in the lungs, whereas PTEN signaling was activated after PBI. Our study highlights the various transcriptional profiles associated with Î³- and X-ray exposures, and the associated pathways include LXR/RXR activation in TBI, whereas pulmonary wound-healing and pulmonary fibrosis signaling was repressed in PBI. Our study provides important insights into the molecular pathways associated with irradiation that can be further investigated for biomarker discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Formyl Peptide Receptor 2 Activity in Hyperoxia-Induced Lung Injury in Newborn Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36142517/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formyl peptide receptor (FPR) 2 is known to play a critical role in regulating inflammation, including either the pro-inflammatory or pro-resolving effects. However, its role in neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury has not been delineated. In this study, we investigate whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attenuate hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury by regulating FPR2 activity. We observed a significant increase in FPR2 levels in alveolar macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) after H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced stress, which decreased after MSC treatment. In the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induction model, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Î± and TNF-Î±) were significantly reduced in RAW264.7 cells after treatment with WRW4, an inhibitor of FPR2, or MSCs. Viability of lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells was significantly improved when cultured in the conditioned media of RAW264.7 cells treated with WRW4 or MSCs, compared to when cultured in the conditioned media of control RAW265.7 cells exposed to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For the in vivo study, wild-type and FPR2 knockout (FPR2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) C57/BL6 mouse pups were randomly exposed to 80% oxygen or room air from postnatal day (P) 1 to P14. At P5, 2 Ã 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; MSCs were transplanted intratracheally. MSCs reduced the elevated FPR2 activity at P7 and improved the decreased FPR2 activity as well as the increased immuno-stained FPR2 activity in alveolar macrophages in hyperoxic lungs at P14. Both FPR&lt;sup&gt;2-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and MSCs similarly attenuated impaired alveolarization and angiogenesis, and increased apoptosis and inflammation of hyperoxic lungs without synergistic effects. Our findings suggest that the protective effects of MSCs in hyperoxic lung injury might be related to indirect modulation of FPR2 activity, at least of alveolar macrophages in neonatal mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Systemic interleukin-6 inhibition ameliorates acute neuropsychiatric phenotypes in a murine model of acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36100846/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute neuropsychiatric impairments occur in over 70% of patients with acute lung injury. Mechanical ventilation is a well-known precipitant of acute lung injury and is strongly associated with the development of acute delirium and anxiety phenotypes. In prior studies, we demonstrated that IL-6 mediates neuropathological changes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of animals with mechanical ventilation-induced brain injury; however, the effect of systemic IL-6 inhibition on structural and functional acute neuropsychiatric phenotypes is not known. We hypothesized that a murine model of mechanical ventilation-induced acute lung injury (VILI) would induce neural injury to the amygdala and hippocampus, brain regions that are implicated in diverse neuropsychiatric conditions, and corresponding delirium- and anxiety-like functional impairments. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these structural and functional changes would reverse with systemic IL-6 inhibition. VILI was induced using high tidal volume (35 cc/kg) mechanical ventilation. Cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) expression was quantified as a neural injury marker and found to be significantly increased in the VILI group compared to spontaneously breathing or anesthetized and mechanically ventilated mice with 10 cc/kg tidal volume. VILI mice treated with systemic IL-6 inhibition had significantly reduced amygdalar and hippocampal CC3 expression compared to saline-treated animals and demonstrated amelioration in acute neuropsychiatric behaviors in open field, elevated plus maze, and Y-maze tests. Overall, these data provide evidence of a pathogenic role of systemic IL-6 in mediating structural and functional acute neuropsychiatric symptoms in VILI and provide preclinical justification to assess IL-6 inhibition as a potential intervention to ameliorate acute neuropsychiatric phenotypes following VILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Interplay between Aquaporin-1 and the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1Î± in a Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Lung Injury Model in Human Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36142499/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquaporin-1 (AQP1), a water channel, and the hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF1A) are implicated in acute lung injury responses, modulating among others pulmonary vascular leakage. We hypothesized that the AQP1 and HIF1A systems interact, affecting mRNA, protein levels and function of AQP1 in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, the role of AQP1 in apoptosis and wound healing progression was examined. Both AQP1 mRNA and protein expression levels were higher in HPMECs exposed to LPS compared to untreated HPMECs. However, in the LPS-exposed &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt;-silenced cells, the mRNA and protein expression levels of AQP1 remained unaltered. In the permeability experiments, a statistically significant volume increase was observed at the 360 s time-point in the LPS-exposed HPMECs, while LPS-exposed &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt;-silenced HPMECs did not exhibit cell swelling, implying a dysfunctional AQP1. AQP1 did not seem to affect cell apoptosis yet could interfere with endothelial migration and/or proliferation. Based on our results, it seems that &lt;em&gt;HIF1A&lt;/em&gt; silencing negatively affects AQP1 mRNA and protein expression, as well as AQP1 function, in the setting of lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knockout of the Circadian Clock Protein PER1 (Period1) Exacerbates Hypertension and Increases Kidney Injury in Dahl Salt-Sensitive Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36093781/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Circadian rhythms play an essential role in physiological function. The molecular clock that underlies circadian physiological function consists of a core group of transcription factors, including the protein PER1 (Period1). Studies in mice show that PER1 plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure and renal sodium handling; however, the results are dependent on the strain being studied. Using male Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats with global knockout of PER1 (&lt;em&gt;SS&lt;sup&gt;Per1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), we aim to test the hypothesis that PER1 plays a key role in the regulation of salt-sensitive blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The model was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 and was characterized using radiotelemetry and measures of renal function and circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;SS&lt;sup&gt;Per1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats had similar mean arterial pressure when fed a normal 0.4% NaCl diet but developed augmented hypertension after three weeks on a high-salt (4% NaCl) diet. Despite being maintained on a normal 12:12 light:dark cycle, &lt;em&gt;SS&lt;sup&gt;Per1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats exhibited desynchrony mean arterial pressure rhythms on a high-salt diet, as evidenced by increased variability in the time of peak mean arterial pressure. &lt;em&gt;SS&lt;sup&gt;Per1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats excrete less sodium after three weeks on the high-salt diet. Furthermore, &lt;em&gt;SS&lt;sup&gt;Per1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats exhibited decreased creatinine clearance, a measurement of renal function, as well as increased signs of kidney tissue damage. &lt;em&gt;SS&lt;sup&gt;Per1-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rats also exhibited higher plasma aldosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Altogether, our findings demonstrate that loss of PER1 in Dahl SS rats causes an array of deleterious effects, including exacerbation of the development of salt-sensitive hypertension and renal damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pretreatment with rosavin attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury in rats through antiferroptosis via PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36097321/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation and oxidative stress caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increase the incidence and mortality rates of respiratory disorders. Rosavin is the main chemical component of Rhodiola plants, which exerts anti-oxidative and antiinflammatory effects. In this research, the potential therapeutic effect of rosavin was investigated by the PM2.5-induced lung injury rat model. Rats were instilled with PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) suspension intratracheally, while rosavin (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) was delivered by intraperitoneal injection before the PM2.5 injection. It was observed that rosavin could prevent lung injury caused by PM2.5. PM2.5 showed obvious ferroptosis-related ultrastructural alterations, which were significantly corrected by rosavin. The pretreatment with rosavin downregulated the levels of tissue iron, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal, and increased the levels of glutathione. The expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was upregulated by rosavin, together with other ferroptosis-related proteins. RSL3, a specific ferroptosis agonist, reversed the beneficial impact of rosavin. The network pharmacology approach predicted the activation of rosavin on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. LY294002, a potent PI3K inhibitor, decreased the upregulation of Nrf2 induced by rosavin. In conclusion, rosavin prevented lung injury induced by PM2.5 stimulation and suppressed ferroptosis via upregulating PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SMPDL3b modulates radiation-induced DNA damage response in renal podocytes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kidneys are radiosensitive and dose-limiting organs for radiotherapy (RT) targeting abdominal and paraspinal tumors. Excessive radiation doses to the kidneys ultimately lead to radiation nephropathy. Our prior work unmasked a novel role for the lipid-modifying enzyme, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3b (SMPDL3b), in regulating the response of renal podocytes to radiation injury. In this study, we investigated the role of SMPDL3b in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair in vitro and in vivo. We assessed the kinetics of DSBs recognition and repair along with the ATM pathway and nuclear sphingolipid metabolism in wild-type (WT) and SMPDL3b overexpressing (OE) human podocytes. We also assessed the extent of DNA damage repair in SMPDL3b knock-down (KD) human podocytes, and C57BL6 WT and podocyte-specific SMPDL3b-knock out (KO) mice after radiation injury. We found that SMPDL3b overexpression enhanced DSBs recognition and repair through modulating ATM nuclear shuttling. OE podocytes were protected against radiation-induced apoptosis by increasing the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and attenuating subsequent caspase-3 cleavage. SMPDL3b overexpression prevented radiation-induced alterations in nuclear ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and ceramide levels. Interestingly, exogenous C1P pretreatment radiosensitized OE podocytes by delaying ATM nuclear foci formation and DSBs repair. On the other hand, SMPDL3b knock-down, in vitro and in vivo, induced a significant delay in DSBs repair. Additionally, increased activation of apoptosis was induced in podocytes of SMPDL3b-KO mice compared to WT mice at 24 h post-irradiation. Together, our results unravel a novel role for SMPDL3b in radiation-induced DNA damage response. The current work suggests that SMPDL3b modulates nuclear sphingolipid metabolism, ATM nuclear shuttling, and DSBs repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSIIA showed evident protective effects in acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nanoemulsion with bioactive excipients enhanced TSIIA activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSIIA alleviates endothelial glycocalyx shedding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endothelial glycocalyx is an important therapeutic target for acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSIIA effect may be attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more serious form; acute respiratory distress syndrome are major causes of COVID-19 related mortality. Finding new therapeutic targets for ALI is thus of great interest. This work aimed to prepare a biocompatible nanoformulation for effective pulmonary delivery of the herbal drug; tanshinone-IIA (TSIIA) for ALI management. A nanoemulsion (NE) formulation based on bioactive natural ingredients; rhamnolipid biosurfactant and tea-tree oil, was developed using a simple ultrasonication technique, optimized by varying oil concentration and surfactant:oil ratio. The selected TSIIA-NE formulation showed 105.7 nm diameter and a PDI â¼ 0.3. EE exceeded 98 % with biphasic sustained drug release and good stability over 3-months. In-vivo efficacy was evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model. TSIIA-NE (30 Âµg/kg) was administered once intratracheally 2 h after LPS instillation. Evaluation was performed 7days post-treatment. Pulmonary function assessment, inflammatory, oxidative stress and glycocalyx shedding markers analysis in addition to histopathological examination of lung tissue were performed. When compared to untreated rats, in-vivo efficacy study demonstrated 1.4 and 1.9-fold increases in tidal volume and minute respiratory volume, respectively, with 32 % drop in wet/dry lung weight ratio and improved levels of arterial blood gases. Lung histopathology and biochemical analysis of different biomarkers in tissue homogenate and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid indicated that treatment may ameliorate LPS-induced ALI symptoms thorough anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory effects and inhibition of glycocalyx degradation. TSIIA-NE efficacy was superior to free medication and blank-NE. The enhanced efficacy of TSIIA bioactive nanoemulsion significantly suggests the pharmacotherapeutic potential of bioactive TSIIA-NE as a promising nanoplatform for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An anticomplement homogeneous polysaccharide from Hedyotis diffusa attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury and inhibits neutrophil extracellular trap formation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36116199/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Owing to the involvement of the overactivated complement system in acute lung injury (ALI) development, anticomplement components may attenuate ALI. Hedyotis diffusa is a traditional Chinese medicine for treating lung heat and its crude polysaccharides (HDP) exhibit significant anticomplement activity in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; To obtain an anticomplement homogeneous polysaccharide from HDP and verify its therapeutic effect and mechanism on ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Diethylaminoethyl-52 (DEAE-52) cellulose and gel permeation columns were used to isolate a homogeneous polysaccharide HD-PS-3, which was then characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and methylation analysis. In vitro, the anticomplement activities of HD-PS-3 through classical and alternative pathways were determined using a hemolytic test. The therapeutic effects of HDP and HD-PS-3 on ALI were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intratracheal instilled mice. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunohistochemical staining were used to assess histological changes, measure cytokine levels, and evaluate the degree of complement component 3c (C3c) deposition and neutrophil infiltration, respectively. ELISA, western blotting, and immunofluorescence were used to analyze neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; From HDP, 1.5 g of the homogeneous polysaccharide HD-PS-3 was obtained. HD-PS-3 was an acidic heteropolysaccharide with an acetyl group, which was composed of â4,6)-Î±-Glcp-(1â, â3,4)-Î±-Glcp-(1â, â4)-Î±-Glcp-(1â, â4,6)-Î±-Galp-(1â, â5)-Î±-Araf-(1â, Î±-Rhap-(1â, Î±-Araf-(1â, Î±-GlcpA-(1â, â4)-Î²-Manp-(1â, Î²-Manp-(1â and â3)-Î²-Manp-(1â. The in vitro results suggest that HD-PS-3 exhibited anticomplement activity with CH50 and AP50 values of 115 Â± 12 Î¼g/ml and 307 Â± 11 Î¼g/ml, respectively. After confirming the efficacy of HDP (200 mg/kg) in attenuating lung injury, the effect of HD-PS-3 on ALI was also investigated. HD-PS-3 (75 and 150 mg/kg) attenuated LPS-induced ALI as well, evidenced by lung pathology, lung injury scores, protein concentration, leukocyte counts, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) contents in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Mechanistically, HD-PS-3 inhibited complement activation, manifested in reduced pulmonary C3c deposition in lung tissue and complement component 3a (C3a) content in BALF. Neutrophil recruitment was also reduced by HD-PS-3, with significantly reduced pulmonary neutrophil infiltration and lower levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in BALF. In addition, HD-PS-3 reduced the levels of MPO-DNA complex in BALF, decreased citrullinated histone H3 (Cit H3) expression and NET formation (colocalization of MPO, Cit H3, and DNA) in lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; An anticomplement homogeneous polysaccharide HD-PS-3 was isolated from H. diffusa. HD-PS-3 exhibited a therapeutic effect against ALI, and the mechanism might be related to its inhibitory effects on complement activation, neutrophil recruitment, and NET formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USP13 Deficiency Impairs Autophagy and Facilitates Age-related Lung Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150040/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an age-related disease. Failure of the proteostasis network with age, including insufficient autophagy, contributes to the pathology of IPF. Mechanisms underlying autophagy disruption in IPF are unclear and may involve regulation of USP (ubiquitin-specific protease) by post-translational modifications. To expand our previous observation of low USP13 expression in IPF, this study evaluated the role of USP13 in age-related lung fibrosis. Here, we demonstrated that &lt;em&gt;Usp13&lt;/em&gt;-deficient aged mice exhibited impaired autophagic activity and increased vulnerability to bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Mechanistically, USP13 interacted with and deubiquitinated Beclin 1, and Beclin 1 overexpression abolished the effects of USP13 disruption. In addition, Beclin 1 inhibition resulted in insufficient autophagy and more severe lung fibrosis after bleomycin injury, consistent with the phenotype of aged &lt;em&gt;Usp13&lt;/em&gt;-deficient mice. Collectively, we show a protective role of USP13 in age-related pulmonary fibrosis. Aging-mediated USP13 loss impairs autophagic activity and facilitates lung fibrosis through Beclin 1 deubiquitination. Our findings support the notion that age-dependent dysregulation of autophagic regulators enhances vulnerability to lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>H1N1 influenza virus dose dependent induction of dysregulated innate immune responses and STAT1/3 activation are associated with pulmonary immunopathological damage</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36082929/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infection poses a substantial challenge and causes high morbidity and mortality. Exacerbated pulmonary inflammatory responses are the major causes of extensive diffuse alveolar immunopathological damage. However, the relationship between the extent of cytokine storm, neutrophils/macrophages infiltration, and different IAV infection dose and time still needs to be further elucidated, and it is still unclear whether the signal transduction and transcriptional activator 1/3 (STAT1/3) signalling pathway plays a beneficial or detrimental role. Here, we established a mouse model of high- and low-dose pH1N1 infection. We found that pH1N1 infection induced robust and early pathological damage and cytokine storm in an infection dose- and time-dependent manner. High-dose pH1N1 infection induced massive and sustained recruitment of neutrophils as well as a higher ratio of M1:M2, which may contribute to severe lung immunopathological damage. pH1N1 infection activated dose- and time-dependent STAT1 and STAT3. Inhibition of STAT1 and/or STAT3 aggravated low-dose pH1N1 infection, induced lung damage, and decreased survival rate. Appropriate activation of STAT1/3 provided survival benefits and pathological improvement during low-dose pH1N1 infection. These results demonstrate that high-dose pH1N1 infection induces robust and sustained neutrophil infiltration, imbalanced macrophage polarization, excessive and earlier cytokine storm, and STAT1/3 activation, which are associated with pulmonary dysregulated proinflammatory responses and progress of acute lung injury. The severe innate immune responses may be the threshold at which protective functions give way to immunopathology, and assessing the magnitude of host innate immune responses is necessary in adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy for alleviating influenza-induced pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>E-prostanoid 3 receptor deficiency on myeloid cells protects against ischemic acute kidney injury via breaking the auto-amplification loop of necroinflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36087809/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necroinflammation plays an important role in disease settings such as acute kidney injury (AKI). We and others have elucidated that prostaglandins, which are critically involved in inflammation, may activate E-prostanoid 3 receptor (EP3) at low concentrations. However, how EP3 blockade interacts with regulated cell death and affects AKI remains unknown. In this study, AKI was induced by ischemia-reperfusion (30 minutes/24 hours) in Ep3 knockout (&lt;em&gt;Ep3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), bone marrow chimeric, myeloid conditional EP3 knockout and corresponding control mice. The production of prostaglandins E2 and I2 was markedly increased after ischemia-reperfusion, and either abrogation or antagonism of EP3 ameliorated the injury. EP3 deficiency curbed inflammatory cytokine release, neutrophil infiltration and serum high-mobility group box 1 levels, but additional TLR4 inhibition with TAK-242 did not offer further protection against the injury and inflammation. The protection of &lt;em&gt;Ep3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was predominantly mediated by suppressing Mixed Lineage Kinase domain-Like-dependent necroptosis, resulting from the inhibition of cytokine generation and the switching of cell death modality from necroptosis to apoptosis through caspase-8 up-regulation, in part due to the restraint of IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling. EP3 deficiency failed to further alleviate the injury when necroptosis was inhibited. &lt;em&gt;Ep3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in bone marrow-derived cells, particularly that in myeloid cells, protected kidneys to the same extent as that of global EP3 deletion. Thus, our results demonstrate that EP3 deficiency especially that on myeloid cells, ameliorates ischemic AKI via curbing inflammation and breaking the auto-amplification loop of necroinflammation. Hence, EP3 may be a promising target for the prevention and/or treatment of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Injury-induced pulmonary tuft cells are heterogenous, arise independent of key Type 2 cytokines, and are dispensable for dysplastic repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36073526/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the lung bears significant regenerative capacity, severe viral pneumonia can chronically impair lung function by triggering dysplastic remodeling. The connection between these enduring changes and chronic disease remains poorly understood. We recently described the emergence of tuft cells within Krt5+ dysplastic regions after influenza injury. Using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, we characterized and delineated multiple distinct tuft cell populations that arise following influenza clearance. Distinct from intestinal tuft cells which rely on Type 2 immune signals for their expansion, neither IL-25 nor IL-4ra signaling are required to drive tuft cell development in dysplastic/injured lungs. In addition, tuft cell expansion occurred independently of type I or type III interferon signaling. Furthermore, tuft cells were also observed upon bleomycin injury, suggesting that their development may be a general response to severe lung injury. While intestinal tuft cells promote growth and differentiation of surrounding epithelial cells, in the lungs of tuft cell deficient mice, Krt5+ dysplasia still occurs, goblet cell production is unchanged, and there remains no appreciable contribution of Krt5+ cells into more regionally appropriate alveolar Type 2 cells. Together, these findings highlight unexpected differences in signals necessary for murine lung tuft cell amplification and establish a framework for future elucidation of tuft cell functions in pulmonary health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal microbiota metabolizing Houttuynia cordata polysaccharides in H1N1 induced pneumonia mice contributed to Th17/Treg rebalance in gut-lung axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36084869/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus is intricately linked to dysregulation of gut microbiota and host immunity. Previous study revealed that Houttuynia cordata polysaccharides (HCP) exert the therapeutic effect on influenza A virus inducing lung and intestine damage via regulating pulmonary and intestinal mucosal immunity. However, whether this result was due to the regulation of gut microbiota in the gut-lung axis remains unclear. Here, we firstly found that the elimination of gut microbiota using antibiotic cocktails led to both loss of the protective effect of HCP on intestine and lung injury, and reduction of the efficacy on regulating Th17/Treg balance in gut-lung axis. Fecal microbiota transplantation study confirmed that the gut microbiota fermented with HCP under pathological conditions (H1N1 infection) was responsible for reducing pulmonary and intestinal injury. Moreover, the interaction of HCP and gut microbiota under pathological conditions exhibited not only much more abundant gut microbial diversity, but also higher content of the acetate. Our results demonstrated that the underlying mechanism to ameliorate viral pneumonia in mice involving Th17/Treg rebalance via the gut microbiota and HCP metabolite (acetate) metabolized in pneumonia mice. Our results provided a new insight for macromolecular polysaccharides through targeting intestinal microenvironment reducing distant pulmonary infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulator of calcineurin 1 deletion attenuates mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in acute kidney injury through JNK/Mff signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36071051/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced acute kidney injury (AKI), characterized by excessive mitochondrial damage and cell apoptosis, remains a clinical challenge. Recent studies suggest that regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) regulates mitochondrial function in different cell types, but the underlying mechanisms require further investigation. Herein, we aim to explore whether RCAN1 involves in mitochondrial dysfunction in AKI and the exact mechanism. In present study, AKI was induced by I/R and cisplatin in RCAN1flox/flox mice and mice with renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs)-specific deletion of RCAN1. The role of RCAN1 in hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) and cisplatin-induced injury in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2 was also examined by overexpression and knockdown of RCAN1. Mitochondrial function was assessed by transmission electron microscopy, JC-1 staining, MitoSOX staining, ATP production, mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay, Annexin V-FITC staining and Western blotting analysis of apoptosis-related proteins. It was found that protein expression of RCAN1 was markedly upregulated in I/R- or cisplatin-induced AKI mouse models, as well as in HR models in HK-2 cells. RCAN1 deficiency significantly reduced kidney damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell apoptosis, whereas RCAN1 overexpression led to the opposite phenotypes. Our in-depth mechanistic exploration demonstrated that RCAN1 increases the phosphorylation of mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) by binding to downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), then promotes dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) migration to mitochondria, ultimately leads to excessive mitochondrial fission of renal TECs. In conclusion, our study suggests that RCAN1 could induce mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis by activating the downstream JNK/Mff signaling pathway. RCAN1 may be a potential therapeutic target for conferring protection against I/R- or cisplatin-AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multimodal single cell sequencing implicates chromatin accessibility and genetic background in diabetic kidney disease progression</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proximal tubule is a key regulator of kidney function and glucose metabolism. Diabetic kidney disease leads to proximal tubule injury and changes in chromatin accessibility that modify the activity of transcription factors involved in glucose metabolism and inflammation. Here we use single nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to show that diabetic kidney disease leads to reduced accessibility of glucocorticoid receptor binding sites and an injury-associated expression signature in the proximal tubule. We hypothesize that chromatin accessibility is regulated by genetic background and closely-intertwined with metabolic memory, which pre-programs the proximal tubule to respond differently to external stimuli. Glucocorticoid excess has long been known to increase risk for type 2 diabetes, which raises the possibility that glucocorticoid receptor inhibition may mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of diabetic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections can compromise the physical and biological functionalities of humans and pose a huge economical and psychological burden on infected patients. Nitric oxide (NO) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, whose mechanism of action is not affected by bacterial resistance. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an endogenous donor and carrier of NO, has gained increasing attention because of its potent antibacterial activity and efficient biocompatibility. Significant breakthroughs have been made in the application of GSNO in biomaterials. This review is based on the existing evidence that comprehensively summarizes the progress of antimicrobial GSNO applications focusing on their anti-infective performance, underlying antibacterial mechanisms, and application in anti-infective biomaterials. We provide an accurate overview of the roles and applications of GSNO in antibacterial biomaterials and shed new light on the avenues for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to the key causative elements of neurological deficits. However, no effective therapeutics have been developed yet. In our previous work, extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) offered new insights as potential strategies for functional recovery of TBI. The current study aims to elucidate the mechanism of action, providing novel therapeutic targets for future clinical interventions. With the miRNA array performed and Real-time PCR validated, we revealed the crucial function of miR-330-5p transferred by SHED-derived EVs (SHED-EVs) in regulating microglia, the critical immune modulator in central nervous system. MiR-330-5p targeted Ehmt2 and mediated the transcription of CXCL14 to promote M2 microglia polarization and inhibit M1 polarization. Identified in our in vivo data, SHED-EVs and their effector miR-330-5p alleviated the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and resumed the motor functional recovery of TBI rats. In summary, by transferring miR-330-5p, SHED-EVs favored anti-inflammatory microglia polarization through Ehmt2 mediated CXCL14 transcription in treating traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosome from BMMSC Attenuates Cardiopulmonary Bypass-Induced Acute Lung Injury Via YAP/Î²-Catenin Pathway: Downregulation of Pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36063391/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) accompanied with systemic inflammatory response is an important complication after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Pyroptosis, which is induced by the secretion of inflammatory factors, has been implicated in ALI. However, recent studies have suggested that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMMSC-Exo) can ameliorate ALI, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Therefore, we aim to examine the effects of BMMSC-Exo in CPB-induced ALI, and its underlying mechanism. CPB rat models (male Sprague-Dawley rats) were administered BMMSC-Exo intravenously before induction of ALI. Lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and alveolar macrophage (AM) were collected after the treatments for further analysis, and rat AM NR8383 cells were used for in vitro study. HE staining was performed to detect macrophage infiltration. Western blot was used to detect related proteins expression. And ELISA assay was performed to investigate secretion of inflammatory factors. These results showed that BMMSC-Exo treatment ameliorated macrophage infiltration and oxidative stress, and downregulated expression of pyroptosis-related proteins, including NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, and GSDMD-N, in the lung tissue and AM, as well as decreased the secretion of IL-18 and IL-1Î² in BALF. Moreover, BMMSC-Exo activated YAP/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Overall, these findings of this study indicated that BMMSC-Exo suppressed CPB-induced pyroptosis in ALI by activating YAP/Î²-catenin axis, which could be a novel strategy for lung protection during CPB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the cGAS-STING Pathway Attenuates Lung Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via Regulating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Alveolar Epithelial Type II Cells of Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36091334/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosol dsDNA sensor, coupling with downstream stimulator of interferon genes (STING) located in the ER, which involves innate immune responses. The aim of our present study was to investigate the effects of cGAS on lung I/R injury via regulating ERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used Sprague-Dawley rats to make the lung I/R model by performing left hilum occlusion-reperfusion surgery. cGAS-specific inhibitor RU.521, STING agonist SR-717, and 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), the ERS inhibitor, were intraperitoneally administered in rats. Double immunofluorescent staining was applied to detect the colocalization of cGAS or BiP, an ERS protein, with alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECIIs) marker. We used transmission electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructure of ER and mitochondria. Apoptosis and oxidative stress in the lungs were assessed, respectively. The profiles of pulmonary edema and lung tissue injury were evaluated. And the pulmonary ventilation function was measured using a spirometer system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In lung I/R rats, the cGAS-STING pathway was upregulated, which implied they were activated. After cGAS-STING pathway was inhibited or activated in lung I/R rats, the ERS was alleviated after cGAS was inhibited, while when STING was activated after lung I/R, ERS was aggravated in the AECIIs, these results suggested that cGAS-STING pathway might trigger ERS responses. Furthermore, activation of cGAS-STING pathway induced increased apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress via regulating ERS and therefore resulted in pulmonary edema and pathological injury in the lungs of I/R rats. Inhibition of cGAS-STING pathway attenuated ERS, therefore attenuated lung injury and promoted pulmonary ventilation function in I/R rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway attenuates lung ischemia/reperfusion injury via alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress in alveolar epithelial type II cells of rats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ischemia and reperfusion injury combined with cisplatin induces immunogenic cell death in lung cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36057637/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first-line chemotherapeutic drug for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), cisplatin (CDDP), fails to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) because it fails to induce calreticulin (CRT) exposure on the cell surface. We investigated the potential of ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R) combined with CDDP to induce ICD in lung cancer cells. The in vitro model of I/R, oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R), effectively induced CRT exposure, ATP secretion, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release and eIF2Î± phosphorylation in both Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and A549 cells when combined with CDDP. By using a vaccine assay and coculture with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), we showed that OGD/R restored the immunogenicity of CDDP by phosphorylating eIF2Î± and demonstrated that OGD/R + CDDP (O + C) is an ICD inducer. Using the inguinal tumor model, we found that I/R significantly enhanced the tumor-killing effect of CDDP and Mitomycin C, and this effect relied on adaptive antitumor immunity. Consistently, I + C altered the ratio of interferon-gamma-secreting T lymphocytes, thus overcoming the immunosuppressive effect induced by CDDP. In conclusion, our research presents a new combination strategy and indicates that I/R is a potential anticancer immunogenic modality when combined with nonimmunogenic chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Colivelin, a synthetic derivative of humanin, ameliorates endothelial injury and glycocalyx shedding after sepsis in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36119052/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-mediated multiple organ failure. Several clinical and experimental studies have suggested that the glycocalyx is an early target of endothelial injury during an infection. Colivelin, a synthetic derivative of the mitochondrial peptide humanin, has displayed cytoprotective effects in oxidative conditions. In the current study, we aimed to determine the potential therapeutic effects of colivelin in endothelial dysfunction and outcomes of sepsis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a clinically relevant model of polymicrobial sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and were treated with vehicle or colivelin (100-200 Âµg/kg) intraperitoneally at 1 h after CLP. We observed that vehicle-treated mice had early elevation of plasma levels of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and P-selectin, the angiogenetic factor endoglin and the glycocalyx syndecan-1 at 6 h after CLP when compared to control mice, while levels of angiopoietin-2, a mediator of microvascular disintegration, and the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, an enzyme implicated in clearance of endotoxins, raised at 18 h after CLP. The early elevation of these endothelial and glycocalyx damage biomarkers coincided with lung histological injury and neutrophil inflammation in lung, liver, and kidneys. At transmission electron microscopy analysis, thoracic aortas of septic mice showed increased glycocalyx breakdown and shedding, and damaged mitochondria in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Treatment with colivelin ameliorated lung architecture, reduced organ neutrophil infiltration, and attenuated plasma levels of syndecan-1, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, macrophage inflammatory protein-1Î± and interleukin-10. These therapeutic effects of colivelin were associated with amelioration of glycocalyx density and mitochondrial structure in the aorta. At molecular analysis, colivelin treatment was associated with inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase in the aorta and lung. In long-term outcomes studies up to 7 days, co-treatment of colivelin with antimicrobial agents significantly reduced the disease severity score when compared to treatment with antibiotics alone. In conclusion, our data support that damage of the glycocalyx is an early pathogenetic event during sepsis and that colivelin may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of sepsis-associated endothelial dysfunction.

      <title>CLEC5A is critical in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced NET formation and acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36048544/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most common nosocomial infections worldwide, and it frequently causes ventilator-associated acute pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Abundant neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to acute lung injury, thereby aggravating ventilator-induced lung damage. While pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) TLR4 and TLR5 are required for host defense against &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; invasion, the PRR responsible for &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced NET formation, proinflammatory cytokine release, and acute lung injury remains unclear. We found that myeloid C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A) interacts with LPS of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; and is responsible for &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced NET formation and lung inflammation. &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; activates CLEC5A to induce caspase-1-dependent NET formation, but it neither causes gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage nor contributes to &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced neutrophil death. Blockade of CLEC5A attenuates &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced NETosis and lung injury, and simultaneous administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb with ciprofloxacin increases survival rate and decreases collagen deposition in the lungs of mice challenged with a lethal dose of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, CLEC5A is a promising therapeutic target to reduce ventilator-associated lung injury and fibrosis in &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;-induced pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An ex vivo culture model of kidney podocyte injury reveals mechanosensitive, synaptopodin-templating, sarcomere-like structures</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney diseases are widespread and incurable. The biophysical mechanisms underlying them are unclear, in part because material systems for reconstituting the microenvironment of relevant kidney cells are limited. A critical question is how kidney podocytes (glomerular epithelial cells) regenerate foot processes of the filtration apparatus following injury. Recently identified sarcomere-like structures (SLSs) with periodically spaced myosin IIA and synaptopodin appear in injured podocytes in vivo. We hypothesized that SLSs template synaptopodin in the initial stages of recovery in response to microenvironmental stimuli and tested this hypothesis by developing an ex vivo culture system that allows control of the podocyte microenvironment. Results supported our hypothesis. SLSs in podocytes that migrated from isolated kidney glomeruli presented periodic synaptopodin-positive clusters that nucleated peripheral, foot process-like extensions. SLSs were mechanoresponsive to actomyosin inhibitors and substrate stiffness. Results suggest SLSs as mechanobiological mediators of podocyte recovery and as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms of Zedoary Turmeric Oil Injection against lipopolysaccharides-induced acute lung injury in rats elucidated by network pharmacology combined with transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36099655/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Prospects for the drug treatment of acute lung injury (ALI) is unpromising. Managing inflammation can prevent ALI from progressing and minimize further deterioration. Zedoary turmeric oil injection (ZTOI), a patented traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that has been used against ALI, has shown significant anti-inflammatory effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism by which ZTOI acts against ALI in rats using an ingredients-targets-pathways (I-T-P) interaction network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design and methods:&lt;/em&gt; The key ingredients of ZTOI were characterized using UPLC-MS/MS combined with literature mining. The target profiles of each ingredient were established using drug-target databases. The anti-inflammatory activity of ZTOI against lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced rat ALI was validated using histopathology and inflammatory factor assessments. The therapeutic targets of ZTOI were screened by integrating transcriptomic results of lung tissues with protein-protein interaction (PPI) expansion. Using KEGG pathway enrichment, an I-T-P network was established to determine the essential interactions among ingredients, targets, and pathways of ZTOI against lung inflammation in ALI. Molecular docking and immunofluorescence staining were utilized to confirm the accuracy of the I-T-P network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 11 sesquiterpenes, whose target profiles may characterize the potential function of ZTOI, were identified as key ingredients. In the ALI rat model, ZTOI can alleviate lung inflammation by decreasing the levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-1Î², and tumor necrosis factor Î± both in serum and lung tissues. Based on our biological samples, transcriptomics, PPI network expansion, and KEGG pathway enrichment, 11 ingredients, 174 targets, and 8 signaling pathways were linked in the I-T-P networks. From these results, ZTOI could be inferred to exert multiple anti-inflammatory effects against ALI through Toll-like receptor, NF-kappa B, RIG-I-like receptor, TNF, NOD-like receptor, IL-17, MAPK, and the Toll and Imd signaling pathways. In addition, two significantly regulated targets in the transcriptome, Usp18 and Map3k7, could be the essential anti-inflammatory targets of ZTOI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; By integrating network pharmacology with ingredient identification and transcriptomics, we show the multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms by which ZTOI acts against ALI on an I-T-P level. This work also provides a methodological reference for related research into TCM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poldip2 knockdown protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via Nox4/Nrf2/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36120334/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymerase Î´-interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) has been reported to mediate acute lung injury (ALI); however, the underlying mechanism is not fully explored. Male C57BL/6 mice and A549 cells were used to establish the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model, then the expression of Poldip2 and its effect on oxidative stress and the resulting inflammation were detected. Adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) mediated Poldip2 knockdown was transfected into mice via intratracheal atomization. And A549 cells stimulated with LPS was used to further confirm our hypothesis in vitro. ML385, specifically inhibited the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Our data suggested that LPS stimulation remarkably increased protein levels of Nox4 and p-P65, activities of NADPH and MPO, and generation of ROS, TNF-Î±, and IL-1Î² while decreased protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 compared with those in NC shRNA + Saline group, which were obviously reversed by Poldip2 knockdown. Concomitantly, Poldip2 knockdown dramatically reduced contents of MDA and enhanced activities of SOD and GSH-Px compared to NC shRNA + LPS group. In vitro, we found that knockdown of Poldip2 significantly reversed LPS-induced increase protein levels of Nox4 and p-P65, activity of NADPH, and generation of ROS, TNF-Î±, and IL-1Î², and decrease protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1, ML385 pretreatment reversed the effects of Poldip2 knockdown mentioned above. Our study indicated that Poldip2 knockdown alleviates LPS-induced ALI via inhibiting Nox4/Nrf2/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diacerein attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ER stress and apoptosis: Impact on the crosstalk between SphK1/S1P, TLR4/NFÎºB/STAT3, and NLRP3/IL-1Î² signaling pathways</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening clinical problem with high mortality rate and limited treatments or preventive options that represents a major challenge for clinicians. Diacerein (DIA) is a multi-target anthraquinone derivative with potent anti-inflammatory action. The aim of this study is to assess the protective effect of DIA and its potential molecular targets against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administrated DIA (50 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (5mg/kg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; DIA mitigated oxidative lung injury in LPS-challenged rats via significantly decreasing lung wet/dry (W/D) ratio, inflammatory cells infiltration, and lipid peroxidation, with concomitant elevation in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels in lung tissue. Likewise, DIA alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress and markedly halted inflammation triggered by LPS challenge in pulmonary tissue by suppressing NLRP3/IL-1Î² and TLR4/NF-ÎºB signaling with parallel decrease in proinflammatory cytokine levels. Interestingly, DIA down regulated Sphk1/S1P axis, reduced GSK-3Î² and STAT3 proteins expression, and markedly decreased caspase-3 besides increasing Bcl-2 levels in lung tissue of LPS-challenged animals. These biochemical findings was simultaneously associated with marked improvement in histological alterations of lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; These findings verify the protective effect of DIA against LPS-induced ALI through targeting oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis. Importantly, DIA halted the hyperinflammatory state triggered by LPS via multi-faceted inhibitory effect on different signaling pathways, hence DIA could potentially reduce mortality in patients with ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel Requirement for Staphylococcal Cell Wall-Anchored Protein SasD in Pulmonary Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36040164/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; can complicate preceding viral infections, including influenza virus. A bacterial infection combined with a preceding viral infection, known as superinfection, leads to worse outcomes than a single infection. Most of the pulmonary infection literature focuses on the changes in immune responses to bacteria between homeostatic and virally infected lungs. However, it is unclear how much of an influence bacterial virulence factors have in single or superinfection. Staphylococcal species express a broad range of cell wall-anchored proteins (CWAs) that have roles in host adhesion, nutrient acquisition, and immune evasion. We screened the importance of these CWAs using mutants lacking individual CWAs in vivo in both bacterial pneumonia and influenza superinfection. In bacterial pneumonia, the lack of individual CWAs leads to various decreases in bacterial burden, lung damage, and immune infiltration into the lung. However, the presence of a preceding influenza infection partially abrogates the requirement for CWAs. In the screen, we found that the uncharacterized CWA &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; surface protein D (SasD) induced changes in both inflammatory and homeostatic lung markers. We further characterized a SasD mutant (sasD A50.1) in the context of pneumonia. Mice infected with sasD A50.1 have decreased bacterial burden, inflammatory responses, and mortality compared to wild-type &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;. Mice also have reduced levels of interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), likely derived from macrophages. Reductions in IL-1Î² transcript levels as well as increased macrophage viability point at differences in cell death pathways. These data identify a novel virulence factor for &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; that influences inflammatory signaling within the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; is a common commensal bacterium that can cause severe infections, such as pneumonia. In the lung, viral infections increase the risk of staphylococcal pneumonia, leading to combined infections known as superinfections. The most common virus associated with &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; pneumonia is influenza, and superinfections lead to worse patient outcomes than either infection alone. While there is much known about how the immune system differs between healthy and virally infected lungs, the role of bacterial virulence factors in single and superinfection is less understood. The significance of our research is identifying bacterial components that play a role in the initiation of lung injury, which could lead to future therapies to prevent pulmonary single or superinfection with &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of immune response in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: far beyond the Th1/Th2 imbalance</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35983984/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease of unknown origin characterized by progressive scarring of the lung leading to irreversible loss of function. Despite the availability of two drugs that are able to slow down disease progression, IPF remains a deadly disease. The pathogenesis of IPF is poorly understood, but a dysregulated wound healing response following recurrent alveolar epithelial injury is thought to be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Areas covered:&lt;/em&gt; In the last few years, the role of the immune system in IPF pathobiology has been reconsidered; indeed, recent data suggest that a dysfunctional immune system may promote and unfavorable interplay with pro-fibrotic pathways thus acting as a cofactor in disease development and progression. In this article, we review and critically discuss the role of T cells in the pathogenesis and progression of IPF in the attempt to highlight ways in which further research in this area may enable the development of targeted immunomodulatory therapies for this dreadful disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expert opinion:&lt;/em&gt; A better understanding of T cell interactions has the potential to facilitate the development of immune modulators targeting multiple T cell-mediated pathways, thus halting disease initiation and progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcriptome analysis identifies IL24 as an autophagy modulator in PM2.5 caused lung dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36049333/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/36049333/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transcriptome analysis revealed the relationship between PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; exposure and autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; exposure led to lung pathological changes in mouse model via autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IL24 was identified as a potential target associated with PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;-induced autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L24 was regulated by inhibition of mTOR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Evidence suggests that exposure to PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; increased hospitalization and mortality rates of respiratory diseases. However, the potential biomarkers and targets associated with PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;-induced lung dysfunction are not fully discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and HALLMARK enrichment analysis of the RNA-seq data (Beas-2B cells treated with PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;) were applied. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify the biological processes correlated with autophagy. Three gene expression profile datasets (GSE158954, GSE155616 and GSE182199) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify the potential targets. PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;-exposed mice were constructed. Real-time qPCR, siRNA transfection, western blot, immunofluorescence, and pathological staining were applied for validation both in vitro and in vivo studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; GO, KEGG and HALLMARK enrichment based on RNA-seq data showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were associated with autophagy like lysosome and macroautophagy. GSEA analysis revealed that PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; was positively correlated with autophagy-related biological processes compared with control group. Venn diagrams identified IL24 was upregulated in our data as well as in these three datasets (GSE158954, GSE155616 and GSE182199) after PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; exposure. Consistent with the analysis, activation of autophagy by PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; was validated in vivo and in vitro. In PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;-exposed mice, lung pathological changes were observed, including airway inflammation and mucus secretion. The mRNA and protein levels of the key gene, IL24, were significantly increased. Moreover, Bafilomycin A1, the inhibitor of autophagy, inhibited the autophagy and ameliorated lung injury induced by PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, downregulation of IL24 decreased autophagy activity. Meanwhile, IL24 was regulated by mTOR signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In summary, we discovered a potential relationship between IL24 and autophagy during PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; exposure. IL24 might be a novel potential biomarker or therapeutic target in PM&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; caused lung dysfunction through regulation of autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung-Targeted Delivery of Cepharanthine by an Erythrocyte-Anchoring Strategy for the Treatment of Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36145566/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the most frequent complications of critical illness, acute lung injury (ALI) carries a high risk of clinical morbidity and mortality. Cepharanthine (CPA) has significant anti-inflammatory activity, however, due to poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and short half-life, it fails to provide effective clinical management measures. Here, we explored the flexibility of an erythrocyte-anchoring strategy using CPA-encapsulated chitosan-coating nanoparticles (CPA-CNPs) anchored onto circulating erythrocytes for the treatment of ALI. CPA-CNPs adhered to erythrocytes successfully (E-CPA-CNPs) and exhibited high erythrocyte adhesion efficiency (&amp;gt;80%). Limited toxicity and favorable biocompatibility enabled further application of E-CPA-CNPs. Next, the reticuloendothelial system evasion features were analyzed in RAW264.7 macrophages and Sprague-Dawley rats. Compared with bare CPA-CNPs, erythrocyte-anchored CNPs significantly decreased cellular uptake in immune cells and prolonged circulation time in vivo. Notably, the erythrocyte-anchoring strategy enabled CNPs to be delivered and accumulated in the lungs (up to 6-fold). In the ALI mouse model, E-CPA-CNPs attenuated the progression of ALI by inhibiting inflammatory responses. Overall, our results demonstrate the outstanding advantages of erythrocyte-anchored CPA-CNPs in improving the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of CPA, which offers great promise for a lung-targeted drug delivery system for the effective treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-217-5p inhibits smog (PM2.5)-induced inflammation and oxidative stress response of mouse lung tissues and macrophages through targeting STAT1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36040387/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; To explore the roles of macrophages&amp;rsquo; miR-217-5p in the process of PM2.5 induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; GEO database and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis as well as GSEA were used to predicted the miRNA and associated target signals. And then mice and RAW246.7 macrophages treated with PM2.5 to imitate PM2.5 induced acute lung injury environment and then transfected with miR-217-5p NC or miR-217-5p mimic. The levels of inflammatory factors TNF-Î± and anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 of mice serum were tested by ELISA. And the pathological changes and ROS level of mouse lung tissues were stained by HE and DHE staining. The proteins expression of phosphorylated-STAT1, total-STAT1, TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³ as well as p47, gp91, NOX4 in mice or RAW264.7 cells were tested by western blot or immunofluorescence of RAW264.7 cell slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results of bioinformatics analysis indicated the miR-217 as well as STAT1 were involved PM2.5 associated lung injury. After exposure to PM2.5, the decreased levels of serum TNF-Î± but not IL-10, consistent with reduced macrophages&amp;rsquo; accumulation as well as decreased ROS levels in lung tissues in miR-217-5p mimic group vs miR-217-5p NC group mice, and moreover, the protein expression levels of phosphorylated&amp;ndash;STAT1, total-STAT1, TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, p47, gp91 and NOX4 in mouse lung tissues and RTAW246.7 macrophages cells were all significantly reduced with miR-217-5p mimic administration. The above phenomena were reversed by specific STAT1-inhibitor HY-N8107.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; miR-217-5p suppressed the activated STAT1-signal induced inflammation and oxidative stress trigged by PM2.5 in macrophages and resulted in the decreased lung injure caused by PM2.5.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Myeloid- and Epithelial-derived Heparin-Binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like Growth Factor Promotes Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36036796/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a poorly understood, progressive lethal lung disease with no known cure. In addition to alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injury and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, chronic inflammation is a hallmark of IPF. Literature suggests that the persistent inflammation seen in IPF primarily consists of monocytes and macrophages. Recent work demonstrates that monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (moAMs) drive lung fibrosis, but further characterization of critical moAM cell attributes is necessary. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is an important epidermal growth factor receptor ligand that has essential roles in angiogenesis, wound healing, keratinocyte migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Our past work has shown HB-EGF is a primary marker of profibrotic M2 macrophages, and this study seeks to characterize myeloid-derived HB-EGF and its primary mechanism of action in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis using &lt;em&gt;Hbegf&lt;sup&gt;f/f&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Lyz2Cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Here, we show that patients with IPF and mice with pulmonary fibrosis have increased expression of HB-EGF and that lung macrophages and transitional AECs of mice with pulmonary fibrosis and humans all express HB-EGF. We also show that &lt;em&gt;Hbegf&lt;sup&gt;f/f&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Lyz2Cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice are protected from bleomycin-induced fibrosis and that this protection is likely multifactorial, caused by decreased CCL2-dependent monocyte migration, decreased fibroblast migration, and decreased contribution of HB-EGF from AEC sources when HB-EGF is removed under the Lyz2Cre promoter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatic fibrosis occurs in response to prolonged tissue injury in the liver, which results in abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have been suggested to play a major role in liver fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), an NAD+ -dependent deacetylase, has been previously implicated in the regulation of the transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²)-SMAD3 pathway that plays a significant role in liver fibrosis. In this work, we aimed to identify other important players during hepatic fibrogenesis, which are modulated by SIRT6. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ or WWTR1), key players in the Hippo pathway, have been implicated in the promotion of hepatic fibrosis. Our data show that HSC-specific Sirt6 knockout mice are more susceptible to high-fat-cholesterol-cholate diet-induced hepatic fibrosis than their wildtype counterparts. Our signaling analyses suggest that in addition to the TGFÎ²-SMAD3 pathway, YAP and TAZ are also highly activated in the SIRT6-deficient HSCs. As it is not clear how SIRT6 might regulate YAP and TAZ, we have decided to elucidate the mechanism underlying the regulation of YAP and TAZ by SIRT6 in HSCs. Overexpression or knockdown of SIRT6 corroborates the role of SIRT6 in the negative regulation of YAP and TAZ. Further biochemical analyses reveal that SIRT6 deacetylates YAP and TAZ and reprograms the composition of the TEA domain transcription factor complex to suppress their downstream target genes, particularly those involved in hepatic fibrosis. In conclusion, our data suggest that SIRT6 plays a critical role in the regulation of the Hippo pathway to protect against hepatic fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vitamin D protects silica particles induced lung injury by promoting macrophage polarization in a KLF4-STAT6 manner</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicosis is one of the severest occupational diseases worldwide, manifesting as infiltration of inflammatory cells, excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and pulmonary diffuse fibrosis. Macrophages polarization to M2 is one of the major strategies that attenuates inflammatory response. Our previous study found that vitamin D could protect against silica-induced lung injury by damping the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here we further identified that vitamin D attenuated silica particles-induced lung inflammation by regulating macrophage polarization in a KLF4-STAT6 manner. Myeloid-specific Stat6 knockout (cKO) mice were generated for in vivo studies. Primary macrophages purified from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of wildtype or Stat6 cKO mice and differentiated THP-1 cells were used for in vitro studies. Vitamin D was found to promote alveolar macrophage polarizing to M2 phenotype through the STAT6 signaling pathway, as demonstrated by worse lung inflammation and ablated protection of vitamin D in silica particles-instilled Stat6 cKO mice. Mechanismly, vitamin D upregulated KLF4 expression in the alveolar macrophage, which synergistically activated STAT6. Additionally, KLF4 was found to upregulate macrophages autophagy, which protected them from silica particles-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. The protective effects of vitamin D were dismissed by silencing KLF4. Our study demonstrates the potential mechanism of vitamin D-mediated macrophage polarization and reveals the therapeutic application of vitamin D in inflammatory disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anti-Fibrotic Effect of SDF-1Î² Overexpression in Bleomycin-Injured Rat Lung</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36145551/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rational:&lt;/em&gt; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease and is associated with high mortality due to a lack of effective treatment. Excessive deposition of the extracellular matrix by activated myofibroblasts in the alveolar space leads to scar formation that hinders gas exchange. Therefore, selectively removing activated myofibroblasts with the aim to repair and remodel fibrotic lungs is a promising approach. Stromal-derived growth factor (SDF-1) is known to stimulate cellular signals which attract stem cells to the site of injury for tissue repair and remodeling. Here, we investigate the effect of overexpression of SDF-1Î² on lung structure using the bleomycin-injured rat lung model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Intratracheal administration of bleomycin was performed in adult male rats (F344). Seven days later, in vivo electroporation-mediated gene transfer of either SDF-1Î² or the empty vector was performed. Animals were sacrificed seven days after gene transfer and histology, design-based stereology, flow cytometry, and collagen measurement were performed on the tissue collected. For in vitro experiments, lung fibroblasts obtained from IPF patients were used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Seven days after SDF-1Î² gene transfer to bleomycin-injured rat lungs, reduced total collagen, reduced collagen fibrils, improved histology and induced apoptosis of myofibroblasts were observed. Furthermore, it was revealed that TNF-Î± mediates SDF-1Î²-induced apoptosis of myofibroblasts; moreover, SDF-1Î² overexpression increased alveolar epithelial cell numbers and proliferation in vivo and also induced their migration in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study demonstrates a new antifibrotic mechanism of SDF-1Î² overexpression and suggests SDF-1Î² as a potential new approach for the treatment of lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil extracellular traps-triggered impaired autophagic flux via METTL3 underlies sepsis-associated acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36030287/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) assist pathogen clearance, while excessive NETs formation is associated with exacerbated inflammatory responses and tissue injury in acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Autophagy is generally considered to be a protective process, but autophagy dysfunction is harmful. Whether and how NETs affect autophagic flux during sepsis-induced ALI are currently unknown. Here, we confirmed that the level of NETs was increased in ARDS patients and mice models, which led to impairment of autophagic flux and deterioration of the disease. Mechanistically, NETs activated METTL3 mediated m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation of Sirt1 mRNA in alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in abnormal autophagy. These findings provide new insights into how NETs contribute to the development of sepsis-associated ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influenza virus causes lung immunopathology through down-regulating PPARÎ³ activity in macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36091002/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatal influenza (flu) virus infection often activates excessive inflammatory signals, leading to multi-organ failure and death, also referred to as cytokine storm. PPARÎ³ (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonists are well-known candidates for cytokine storm modulation. The present study identified that influenza infection reduced PPARÎ³ expression and decreased PPARÎ³ transcription activity in human alveolar macrophages (AMs) from different donors. Treatment with PPARÎ³ agonist Troglitazone ameliorated virus-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion but did not interfere with the IFN-induced antiviral pathway in human AMs. In contrast, PPARÎ³ antagonist and knockdown of PPARÎ³ in human AMs further enhanced virus-stimulated proinflammatory response. In a mouse model of influenza infection, flu virus dose-dependently reduced PPARÎ³ transcriptional activity and decreased expression of PPARÎ³. Moreover, PPARÎ³ agonist troglitazone significantly reduced high doses of influenza infection-induced lung pathology. In addition, flu infection reduced PPARÎ³ expression in all mouse macrophages, including AMs, interstitial macrophages, and bone-marrow-derived macrophages but not in alveolar epithelial cells. Our results indicate that the influenza virus specifically targets the PPARÎ³ pathway in macrophages to cause acute injury to the lung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plasma Cell-Free DNA Predicts Survival and Maps Specific Sources of Injury in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36004627/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36004627/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a noninvasive marker of cellular injury. Its significance in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Plasma cfDNA was measured in 2 PAH cohorts (A, n=48; B, n=161) and controls (n=48). Data were collected for REVEAL 2.0 (Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management) scores and outcome determinations. Patients were divided into the following REVEAL risk groups: low (â¤6), medium (7-8), and high (â¥9). Total cfDNA concentrations were compared among controls and PAH risk groups by 1-way analysis of variance. Log-rank tests compared survival between cfDNA tertiles and REVEAL risk groups. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were estimated from logistic regression models. A sample subset from cohort B (n=96) and controls (n=16) underwent bisulfite sequencing followed by a deconvolution algorithm to map cell-specific cfDNA methylation patterns, with concentrations compared using t tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In cohort A, median (interquartile range) age was 62 years (47-71), with 75% female, and median (interquartile range) REVEAL 2.0 was 6 (4-9). In cohort B, median (interquartile range) age was 59 years (49-71), with 69% female, and median (interquartile range) REVEAL 2.0 was 7 (6-9). In both cohorts, cfDNA concentrations differed among patients with PAH of varying REVEAL risk and controls (analysis of variance _P_â¤0.002) and were greater in the high-risk compared with the low-risk category (_P_â¤0.002). In cohort B, death or lung transplant occurred in 14 of 54, 23 of 53, and 35 of 54 patients in the lowest, middle, and highest cfDNA tertiles, respectively. cfDNA levels stratified as tertiles (log-rank: &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.0001) and REVEAL risk groups (log-rank: &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) each predicted transplant-free survival. The addition of cfDNA to REVEAL improved discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.72-0.78; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.02). Compared with controls, methylation analysis in patients with PAH revealed increased cfDNA originating from erythrocyte progenitors, neutrophils, monocytes, adipocytes, natural killer cells, vascular endothelium, and cardiac myocytes (Bonferroni adjusted &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). cfDNA concentrations derived from erythrocyte progenitor cells, cardiac myocytes, and vascular endothelium were greater in patients with PAH with high-risk versus low-risk REVEAL scores (_P_â¤0.02).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Circulating cfDNA is elevated in patients with PAH, correlates with disease severity, and predicts worse survival. Results from cfDNA methylation analyses in patients with PAH are consistent with prevailing paradigms of disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Urinary profile of PAHs and related compounds in women working in beauty salons</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36029813/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36029813/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First survey of urinary PAHs, 1-OHP and TTMA levels in women working in beauty salons;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High PAHs, 1-OHP and TTMA levels were detected in urine of beauticians after the work shift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The urinary PAHs, 1-OHP and TTMA were correlated with âpersonal care products (PCPs) usageâ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some PAHs were associated with oxidative stress/kidney injury biomarkers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beauty activities can be considered as a major source of PAHs, 1-OHP and TTMA exposures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of chemical compounds which interest to human biological monitoring researches because of their potential carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic properties. However, the exposure of female beauticians to these contaminants is not well-reported. For biomonitoring of potential exposure of female cosmeticians to PAHs in beauty salons, urine samples were taken from cosmetologist women (n = 50.00) and housewives (n = 35.00) as the exposure group (EG) and control group (CG), respectively. Next, unmetabolized PAHs levels as well as the concentration of - 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) were analyzed in these specimens. In addition, since benzene has some common source with PAHs, in this study t, t&amp;rsquo;-Muconic acid (TTMA) level was also determined as the metabolite and indicator of exposure to benzene. The results indicated a high detection frequency of the target compounds (PAHs, 1-OHP and TTMA) in the urine specimens of beauticians. The results also showed that there is a significant difference between the concentration of these pollutants in the urine specimens of the exposure and control groups. The median concentration of Î£PAHs, 1-OHP, and TTMA in the before exposure (BE) specimens collected from the exposure group were 337.42 ng/L, 593.92 ng/L, and 247.90 Î¼g/L, respectively. However, a higher concentration of these contaminants was observed in the after exposure specimens with a median concentration of 423.29 ng/L, 745.03 ng/L, and 310.97 Î¼g/L, respectively. In terms of contribution of PAHs compounds in total toxic equivalents, DahA, BaP, and IndP with 59.03, 28.73, and 2.86 % had the largest share. In this study, it was also observed that some kidney damage biomarkers as well as some oxidative stress injury biomarkers are positively and significantly correlated with the urinary values of âPAHs. Thus, it can be concluded that high health risks threaten the female beauticians regarding kidney injury and DNA oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Assessing the Global Impact on the Mouse Kidney After Traumatic Brain Injury: A Transcriptomic Study</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36042866/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36042866/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we use animal models combined with bioinformatics strategies to investigate the potential changes in overall renal transcriptional expression after traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Microarray analysis was performed after kidney acquisition using unilateral controlled cortical impact as the primary mouse TBI model. Multi-oriented gene set enrichment analysis was performed for differentially expressed genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that TBI affected the gene set associated with mitochondria function in kidney cells, and a negative enrichment of gene sets associated with immune cell migration and epidermal development was also observed. Analysis of the disease phenotype gene set revealed that differential expression of mitochondria-related genes was associated with lactate metabolism. Alternatively, activation and adhesion of immune cells associated with the complement system may promote autoinflammation in kidney tissue. The simulated immune cell infiltration analysis showed an increase in the proportion of activated memory CD4 T cells and a decrease in the proportion of resting memory CD4 T cells, suggesting that activated memory CD4 T cell infiltration may be involved in the inflammation of renal tissue and cause damage to renal cells, such as principal cells, mesangial cells and loops of Henle cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study is the first to reveal the effects of brain trauma on the kidney. TBI may affect the expression of mitochondria function-related gene sets in renal cells by increasing lactate. It may also affect renal mesangial cells by inducing increased infiltration of immune cells through mechanisms related to complement system activation or autoimmune antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cephalosporins-induced intestinal dysbiosis exacerbated pulmonary endothelial barrier disruption in streptococcus pneumoniae-infected mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36093187/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic abuse is growing more severe in clinic, and even short-term antibiotic treatment can cause long-term gut dysbiosis, which may promote the development and aggravation of diseases. Cephalosporins as the broad-spectrum antibiotics are widely used for prevention and treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in children. However, their potential consequences in health and disease have not been fully elaborated. In this study, the effects of cefaclor, cefdinir and cefixime on intestinal microbiota and lung injury were investigated in &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; (Spn)-infected mice. The results showed that the proportion of coccus and bacillus in intestinal microbiota were changed after oral administration with cefaclor, cefdinir and cefixime twice for 10 days, respectively. Compared with the Spn-infected group, the proportion of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; in intestine were significantly reduced, while Enterococcus and Candida was increased after cephalosporin treatment. Furthermore, 3 cephalosporins could obviously increase the number of total cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes in BALF as well as the serum levels of endotoxin, IL-2, IL-1Î², IL-6 and TNF-Î±. Mechanically, cephalosporins accelerated Spn-induced pulmonary barrier dysfunction via mediating the mRNA expressions of endothelial barrier-related proteins (Claudin 5, Occludin, and ZO-1) and inflammation-related proteins (TLR4, p38 and NF-ÎºB). However, all of those consequences could be partly reversed by &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium bifidum&lt;/em&gt; treatment, which was closely related to the elevated acetate production, indicating the protective effects of probiotic against antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that oral administration with cephalosporins not only disrupted intestinal microecological homeostasis, but also increased the risk of Spn infection, resulting in severer respiratory inflammation and higher bacterial loads in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intermittent fasting attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice by modulating macrophage polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028098/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a spectrum of acute and life-threatening pulmonary inflammatory conditions. Treatment of ALI remains a clinical challenge. Recently, intermittent fasting (IF) has been shown to improve health and alleviate many diseases. In this study, we tested whether IF attenuated ALI and investigated the mechanism underlying this process. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, the effects of IF on ALI were evaluated in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine ALI model. We found that two times of 24-h fasting in a week before ALI efficiently ameliorated LPS-induced lung injury in mice, characterized by alleviated lung lesions, wet-to-dry weight ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde content, and lower levels of tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1Î². &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, functional assays were conducted to assess IF on the inflammatory response and macrophage polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with LPS or IL-4. And PPARÎ³ antagonist GW9662 and AMPK siRNA were used to test the role of PPARÎ³ and AMPK in the IF-mediated improvement of ALI. The results showed that IF (serum deprivation) suppressed macrophage M1 activation and promoted M2 activation in LPS-treated BMDMs. While, IF also augmented macrophage M2 polarization in IL-4-treated BMDMs. Further mechanistic studies showed that the promotive effect of IF on M2 polarization was related to the activation of the PPARÎ³ and AMPK pathways. In conclusion, this study suggests that IF enhances M2 polarization by activating the AMPK and PPARÎ³ pathways, thus facilitating anti-inflammatory response and ameliorating ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is a pathological process that occurs in numerous organs throughout the human body and is frequently associated with severe cellular damage and death. Puerarin is an isoflavone compound extracted from the root of Pueraria lobata and has pharmacological effects such as dilating cerebral vessels and anti-free radical generation in cerebral ischemic tissues. With the deepening of experimental research and clinical research on puerarin, it has been found that puerarin has a protective effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of the heart, brain, spinal cord, lung, intestine and other organs. In summary, puerarin has a vast range of pharmacological effects and significant protective effects, and it also has obvious advantages in the clinical protection of patients with organ IRI. With the deepening of experimental pharmacological research and clinical research, it is expected to be an effective drug for IRI treatment. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the protective effect of puerarin on I/R organ injury and its possible underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pyrogallol enhances therapeutic effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells against LPS-mediated inflammation and lung injury via activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028178/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenges in clinical applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attributed to their heterogeneity. It is believed that preconditioning of MSCs with active compounds may enhance the expression of potentially therapeutic molecules and thus achieve stable and effective therapeutic outcomes. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which pyrogallol increased the therapeutic efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) against LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI). hUCMSCs with pyrogallol treatment increased expression of HO-1 at both mRNA and protein levels, accompanied by Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1 (Keap1) degradation, and upregulation of the Nrf2 protein levels as well as nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Moreover, the modulation of Keap1 and Nrf2 as well as HO-1 upregulation by pyrogallol was reversed by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and a P38 kinase inhibitor (SB203580). Whereas, NAC pretreatment abrogated pyrogallol-mediated activation of P38 kinase, indicating that pyrogallol-derived ROS led to P38 kinase activation, thus promoting Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Additionally, we found that the induction of p62 by the pyrogallol-mediated ROS/P38/Nrf2 axis interacted with Keap1 and resulted in autophagic degradation of Keap1, which created a positive feedback loop to further release of Nrf2. Furthermore, the increased expression of HO-1 in pyrogallol-pretreated hUCMSCs led to enhanced inhibitory effects on LPS-mediated TLR4/P-P65 signaling in BEAS-2B cells, resulting in increasing suppression of LPS-indued expression of a series of pro-inflammatory mediators. Compared to untreated hUCMSCs, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with pyrogallol-primed hUCMSCs transplantation showed enhanced improvements in LPS-mediated lung pathological alterations, the increased lung index (lung/body ratio), apoptosis of epithelial cells, the activation of TLR4/NF-ÎºB signaling as well as the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Together, these results suggested that hUCMSCs with pyrogallol pretreatment enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSCs, which may provide a promising therapeutic strategy to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of hUCMSC-based therapy for treating LPS-associated ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury and concomitant apoptosis induction via ROS-mediated ER stress is efficaciously counteracted by epigallocatechin gallate</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36028100/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhabdomyolysis induced acute kidney injury (RIAKI) is a life-threatening condition responsible for approximately 19-58% of AKI cases worldwide. We performed an intramuscular injection of glycerol (10 mL/kg) in male wistar rats to induce AKI. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was administered for 3 consecutive days to evaluate its protective effects. We observed significant downregulation in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and LDH at different time points on EGCG treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, H&amp;amp;E staining also revealed that EGCG was able to reduce the formation of damaged tubules and tubular necrosis which was prominently spread throughout the kidney tissue of glycerol treatment group. Concomitantly, we observed upregulated inflammation, ER stress and elevated oxidative stress in the glycerol treated group only, which was significantly normalized upon EGCG treatment in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The occurrence of apoptosis in kidney tubules was found to be relatively higher in glycerol treated group and H2O2 treated HEK-293 cells. The results obtained after EGCG treatment revealed a significant decrease in apoptotic cell population, which was further validated by immunofluorescence staining against p53 and comet assay in HEK-293 cells and p53 IHC in kidney tissues. Western blotting also revealed a systemic downregulation of intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway markers such as bax, bcl-2, pro and cleaved caspase 3, caspase 9 and PARP1. Additionally, the results for flow cytometry analysis and TUNEL assay corroborated apoptotic equilibrium. Conclusively, we reckon EGCG as a multi-therapeutic natural product that can be used the for treatment of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generation of Plvap-CreER and Car4-CreER for genetic targeting of distinct lung capillary populations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been reported recently that there are two distinct subpopulations of capillary endothelial cells in the mammalian lungs: gCap (general capillary) and aCap (aerocyte). They are identified by two unique markers, respectively: plasmalemmal vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP) and carbonic anhydrase IV (CAR4). Here, we report two novel knock-in mouse lines Plvap-CreER and Car4-CreER, which genetically target gCap and aCap, respectively. Induced by tamoxifen, the Plvap-CreER and Car4-CreER alleles mediate specific and efficient Cre-loxP recombinations in PLVAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gCap and CAR4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; aCap, respectively, in the lungs. These two mouse lines are useful genetic tools to investigate cell fates and functions of PLVAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CAR4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in lung homeostasis, injury and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simultaneous Monitoring of HOCl and Viscosity with Drug-Induced Pyroptosis in Live Cells and Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35998356/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis is a newly identified form of cell death that is closely correlated with many diseases. Recent studies have indicated that the inflammation in pyroptosis would accelerate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, intracellular viscosity is another key microenvironmental parameter that reflects many physiological and pathological states in the early stage, hypochlorous acid (HOCl), as an important ROS, also plays significant roles in a variety of pathologies. However, the fluctuation of viscosity and HOCl in the process of pyroptosis is still unknown. Herein, we present a dual-responsive fluorescent probe (Lyso-VH) for simultaneously detecting viscosity and HOCl. Lyso-VH was successfully used to image the fluctuation of HOCl and viscosity in the lysosome of three kinds of cells with dependent and independent channels. Moreover, Lyso-VH can be employed to investigate the changes of HOCl and viscosity during the process of pyroptosis in living cells and acute lung injury (ALI). Thus, this work can not only serve as a powerful tool to simultaneously visualize the fluctuation of HOCl and viscosity in lysosomes, but also provide a new insight into drug-induced pyroptosis in living cells and acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligent nanomedicines integrated with stimuli-responsive components enable on-demand customizable treatment options which would improve therapeutic outcome and reduce systemic toxicity. In this work, we explore the synergistic therapeutic potential of photodynamic therapy and immunometabolic modulation to achieve tumour regression and to trigger an adaptive immunity to prevent tumour recurrence. The therapeutic potential of the fabricated Bioengineered Immunomodulatory Organelle targeted Nanozymes (BIONs) was tested on 3D printed mini-brains which could effectively recapitulate the biologically relevant interactions between glioblastoma cells and macrophages. In the presence of glioblastoma organotypic brain slices, activated BIONs upregulated the cell surface expression of CD86, a costimulatory molecule and CD83, maturation marker, on monocyte derived dendritic cells, suggesting its ability to elicit a strong immune response. Furthermore, the antigen pulsed dendritic cells by chemotaxis and transendothelial migration readily relocate into the draining lymph node where they present the antigenic cargo to enable the proliferation of T lymphocytes. The stealth and tunable catalytic activity of BIONs prevent ROS mediated diseases such as acute kidney injury by providing environment dependent protection without compromising on its promising anti-cancer activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blocking CHOP-dependent TXNIP shuttling to mitochondria attenuates albuminuria and mitigates kidney injury in nephrotic syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35994650/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albuminuria is the hallmark of nephrotic syndrome (NS), a leading cause of chronic kidney disease affecting 500 million people worldwide. Thus, there is a clear need to discover novel drug targets to treat proteinuric kidney disease. We demonstrate that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a redox protein that forms the complex with antioxidant oxidoreductase thioredoxin (Trx), relocates from nucleus to mitochondria when C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a major endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated transcription factor, is induced by albuminuria. TXNIP shuttling to mitochondria is essential for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which oxidizes mitochondrial-specific Trx2 and disrupts the association between Trx2-TXNIP and Trx2-ASK1 in mitochondria, leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Thus, TXNIP is a potential target to treat NS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albuminuria is a hallmark of glomerular disease of various etiologies. It is not only a symptom of glomerular disease but also a cause leading to glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and eventually, a decline in kidney function. The molecular mechanism underlying albuminuria-induced kidney injury remains poorly defined. In our genetic model of nephrotic syndrome (NS), we have identified CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein)-TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting protein) as critical molecular linkers between albuminuria-induced ER dysfunction and mitochondria dyshomeostasis. TXNIP is a ubiquitously expressed redox protein that binds to and inhibits antioxidant enzyme, cytosolic thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), and mitochondrial Trx2. However, very little is known about the regulation and function of TXNIP in NS. By utilizing &lt;em&gt;Chop&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Txnip&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice as well as &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-Galuminox, our molecular imaging probe for detection of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo, we demonstrate that CHOP up-regulation induced by albuminuria drives TXNIP shuttling from nucleus to mitochondria, where it is required for the induction of mitochondrial ROS. The increased ROS accumulation in mitochondria oxidizes Trx2, thus liberating TXNIP to associate with mitochondrial nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) to activate inflammasome, as well as releasing mitochondrial apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) to induce mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Importantly, inhibition of TXNIP translocation and mitochondrial ROS overproduction by CHOP deletion suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation and p-ASK1-dependent mitochondria apoptosis in NS. Thus, targeting TXNIP represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effect of invasive mechanical ventilation on the diversity of the pulmonary microbiota</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35996150/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary microbial diversity may be influenced by biotic or abiotic conditions (e.g., disease, smoking, invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), etc.). Specially, invasive MV may trigger structural and physiological changes in both tissue and microbiota of lung, due to gastric and oral microaspiration, altered body posture, high O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation-induced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; toxicity in hypoxemic patients, impaired airway clearance and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which in turn reduce the diversity of the pulmonary microbiota and may ultimately lead to poor prognosis. Furthermore, changes in (local) O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration can reduce the diversity of the pulmonary microbiota by affecting the local immune microenvironment of lung. In conclusion, systematic literature studies have found that invasive MV reduces pulmonary microbiota diversity, and future rational regulation of pulmonary microbiota diversity by existing or novel clinical tools (e.g., lung probiotics, drugs) may improve the prognosis of invasive MV treatment and lead to more effective treatment of lung diseases with precision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Increased expression and accumulation of GDF15 in IPF extracellular matrix contribute to fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35993367/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease of unmet medical need. It is characterized by formation of scar tissue leading to a progressive and irreversible decline in lung function. IPF is associated with repeated injury, which may alter the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we demonstrate that IPF patient-derived pulmonary ECM drives profibrotic response in normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) in a 3D spheroid assay. Next, we reveal distinct alterations in composition of the diseased ECM, identifying potentially novel associations with IPF. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) was identified among the most significantly upregulated proteins in the IPF lung-derived ECM. In vivo, GDF15 neutralization in a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model led to significantly less fibrosis. In vitro, recombinant GDF15 (rGDF15) stimulated Î± smooth muscle actin (Î±SMA) expression in NHLF, and this was mediated by the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) receptor. Furthermore, in the presence of rGDF15, the migration of NHLF in collagen gel was reduced. In addition, we observed a cell type-dependent effect of GDF15 on the expression of cell senescence markers. Our data suggest that GDF15 mediates lung fibrosis through fibroblast activation and differentiation, implicating a potential direct role of this matrix-associated cytokine in promoting aberrant cell responses in disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is well recognized as a distinct contributor to cardiac hypertrophy, while the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, the authors show that myocardial mitochondrial oxidative damage is early and prominent in CKD and distinctively stimulates the STING-NFÎºB pathway by releasing mitochondrial DNA to drive cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, the authors reveal that ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1)-putrescine metabolic flux is transactivated by NFÎºB and is required for the STING-NFÎºB pathway to drive cardiac hypertrophy. Finally, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the myocardial mitochondria-STING-NFÎºB-ODC1 axis significantly prevents CKD-associated cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, targeting the myocardial mitochoandria-STING-NFÎºB-ODC1 axis is a promising therapeutic strategy for cardiac hypertrophy in patients with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct exposure to formaldehyde can cause lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircRNAs involvement in formaldehyde-induced lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rno_circRNA_008646 contributed to formaldehyde induced lung injury through rno-miR-224 mediated FOXI1/CFTR axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formaldehyde (FA) serves as a prevailing air pollutant, which has seriously threatened public health in recent years. Of all the known health effects, lung injury is one of the most severe risks. However, little is known about the circRNAs related molecular mechanism in the development of lung injury induced by FA. This study was designed to explore the potential roles of dysregulated circRNAs as well as its mechanism in FA-induced lung injury. In the present study, 24 male SD rats were exposed to formaldehyde (control, 0.5, 2.46 and 5 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for 8 h per day for 8 weeks to induce lung injury. We used H&amp;amp;E staining to evaluate the histopathological changes of lung injury indifferent groups. The expression of circRNAs in lung tissue was detected by real-time PCR. Meanwhile, circRNA/miRNA/mRNA interaction networks were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Our study revealed that formaldehyde exposure resulted in abnormal histopathological changes in lung tissues. Moreover, the expression of rno_circRNA_008646 was significantly higher in lung tissues of formaldehyde exposure rats than in control. Bioinformatics analysis showed that one potential target miRNA/mRNA for rno_circRNA_008646 was rno-miR-224/Forkhead Box I1 (FOXI1). Besides, luciferase report gene confirmed that there was targeted binding relationship between rno_circRNA_008646 and rno-miR-224, rno-miR-224 and FOXI1. Further verification experiments indicated that the expression of rno_circRNA_008646 was negatively correlated rno-miR-224, while it was positively correlated with FOXI1. JASPAR database showed transcription factor FOXI1 located in promotor of CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). Both FOXI1 and CFTR were up-regulated in lung tissues after formaldehyde exposure. In conclusion, our findings suggested that formaldehyde may induce lung injury, and this may be caused by up-regulatedrno_circRNA_008646, which medicated rno-miR-224/FOXI1/CFTR axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immune-mediated tubule atrophy promotes acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease transition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incomplete repair after acute kidney injury can lead to development of chronic kidney disease. To define the mechanism of this response, we compared mice subjected to identical unilateral ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury with either contralateral nephrectomy (where tubule repair predominates) or contralateral kidney intact (where tubule atrophy predominates). By day 14, the kidneys undergoing atrophy had more macrophages with higher expression of chemokines, correlating with a second wave of proinflammatory neutrophil and T cell recruitment accompanied by increased expression of tubular injury genes and a decreased proportion of differentiated tubules. Depletion of neutrophils and T cells after day 5 reduced tubular cell loss and associated kidney atrophy. In kidney biopsies from patients with acute kidney injury, T cell and neutrophil numbers negatively correlated with recovery of estimated glomerular filtration rate. Together, our findings demonstrate that macrophage persistence after injury promotes a T cell- and neutrophil-mediated proinflammatory milieu and progressive tubule damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the cardiac fibroblast-enriched histone methyltransferase Dot1L prevents cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35986422/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition that contributes to compromised cardiac function and potentially heart failure. Disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (Dot1L) is the catalytic enzyme required for histone H3K79 methylation which has been demonstrated to play a role in transcriptional activation. However, the functions of Dot1L in the process of cardiac fibrosis still remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In the present study, we found that endogenous Dot1L is upregulated in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) treated with angiotensin II (Ang II) or transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²1, along with elevated extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fibronectin, collagen I and III. Silencing or inhibiting Dot1L mitigated Ang II-induced myofibroblast generation and fibrogenesis. We identified the transcription factor-forkhead box O (FoxO) 3a as a novel substrate of Dot1L, the transcriptional activating mark H3K79me3 level on the promoter of FoxO3a was increase in activated-CFs, and inhibition of Dot1L markedly decreased FoxO3a transcription accompanied by a significant decrease in the expression of fibrogenic gene. Knockdown of FoxO3a could alleviate ECM deposition induced by Ang II, on the contrary, overexpression FoxO3a resulting in CFs activation. Consistently, in vivo Dot1L ablation rescued myocardial ischemia-induced cardiac fibrosis and improved cardiac function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings conclude that upregulation of Dot1L results in activation of the cardiac fibroblasts to promote profibrotic gene, eventually causes cardiac fibrosis. Pharmacological targeting for Dot1L might represent a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of human cardiac fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antioxidant mitoquinone ameliorates EtOH-LPS induced lung injury by inhibiting mitophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36059543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic ethanol abuse is a systemic disorder and a risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. One explanation is that ethanol produces damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disturbs the balance of mitochondria within the lungs to promote a pro-injury environment. We hypothesized that targeting an antioxidant to the mitochondria would prevent oxidative damage and attenuate EtOH-LPS-induced lung injury. To test this, we investigated the effects of mitochondria-targeted ubiquinone, Mitoquinone (MitoQ) on ethanol-sensitized lung injury induced by LPS. Lung inflammation, ROS, mitochondria function, and mitophagy were assessed. We demonstrated that chronic ethanol feeding sensitized the lung to LPS-induced lung injury with significantly increased reactive oxygen species ROS level and mitochondrial injury as well as lung cellular NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These deleterious effects were attenuated by MitoQ administration in mice. The protective effects of MitoQ are associated with decreased cellular mitophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Taken together, our results demonstrated that ethanol aggravated LPS-induced lung injury, and antioxidant MitoQ protects from EtOH-LPS-induced lung injury, probably through reducing mitophagy and protecting mitochondria, followed by NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results will provide the prevention and treatment of ethanol intake effects with new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eupalinolide B attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury through inhibition of NF-ÎºB and MAPKs signaling by targeting TAK1 protein</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35988521/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eupalinolide B (EB) inhibit LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EB directly binds to TAK1, and inhibits NF-ÎºB and MAPKs activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Î±,Î³-unsaturated lactone of EB is vital for its anti-inflammatory effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease characterized by severe inflammatory response, which has no pharmacological therapy in clinic. In this study, we found that eupalinolide B (EB), a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Eupatorium lindleyanum, significantly ameliorated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice, which manifests as reduction in lung injury score, activity of myeloperoxidase, and release of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In RAW264.7 murine macrophages, EB effectively inhibited LPS-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by down-regulating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), respectively. Mechanistically, EB not only blocked LPS-induced phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase-Î±/Î² (IKKÎ±/Î²), phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B alpha (IÎºBÎ±), and phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) P65, but also suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Through cellular thermal shift assay and western blotting, EB was demonstrated to target and inactivate transforming growth factor Î² activated kinase-1 (TAK1), which is an important upstream kinase for the activation of NF-ÎºB and MAPKs pathways. Additionally, EB-mediated actions were markedly abolished by dithiothreitol in LPS-exposed RAW264.7 cells, suggesting a crucial role of the Î±,Î³-unsaturated lactone for the anti-inflammatory activity of EB. In conclusion, our findings showed that EB could effectively alleviate ALI in mice, and attenuate inflammatory response by inhibiting the activation of TAK1, and TAK1-mediated activation of NF-ÎºB and MAPKs cascades.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oxypeucedanin relieves LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the inflammation and maintaining the integrity of the lung air-blood barrier</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35985771/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is commonly accompanied by a severe inflammatory reaction process, and effectively managing inflammatory reactions is an important therapeutic approach for alleviating ALI. Macrophages play an important role in the inflammatory response, and this role is proinflammatory in the early stages of inflammation and anti-inflammatory in the late stages. Oxypeucedanin is a natural product with a wide range of pharmacological functions. This study aimed to determine the effect of oxypeucedanin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, the following experiments were performed based on LPS-induced models &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Using myeloperoxidase activity measurement, ELISA, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting, we found that oxypeucedanin modulated the activity of myeloperoxidase and decreased the expression levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1Î², MPO, COX-2 and iNOS in LPS-induced inflammation models. Meanwhile, oxypeucedanin inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT and its downstream NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, oxypeucedanin significantly decreased the pulmonary vascular permeability, which was induced by LPSs, and the enhanced expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin and Claudin 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of oxypeucedanin is associated with the inhibition of the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling pathways and the maintenance of the integrity of the lung air-blood barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that poses a major challenge in critical care medicine. The development of ALI/ARDS involves excessive inflammatory response, and macrophage autophagy plays an important role in regulating the inflammatory response in ALI/ARDS. In this paper, we review the effects of autophagy in regulating macrophage function, discuss the roles of macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS, and highlight drugs and other interventions that can modulate macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS to improve the understanding of the mechanism of macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS and provide new ideas and further research directions for the treatment of ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Puerarin ameliorates acute lung injury by modulating NLRP3 inflammasome-induced pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35977927/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We commenced to analyze putative anti-pyroptosis effects of puerarin (PU) as mediated by the PP2A-HDAC1-NLRP3 pathway in acute lung injury (ALI). ALI animal and cell models were constructed, followed by treatment of PU. Then, the effect of HDAC1, PP2A, and NLRP3 on cell inflammation and pyroptosis was explored. The interaction between HDAC1 and PP2A as well as between PP2A and NLRP3 was analyzed. Our findings suggested that PU downregulated HDAC1 expression to alleviate symptoms of ALI. HDAC1 overexpression promoted inflammation induced by LPS, which reversed the inhibitory effect of PU on ALI. HDAC1 overexpression also decreased PP2A expression, suggesting that PP2A was involved in the effects of HDAC1 on LPS-induced inflammation. PP2A exerted inhibitory effects on NLRP3. Meanwhile, PU hindered the progression of ALI by silencing HDAC1 or overexpressing PP2A both in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, PU restrained pyroptosis of cells induced by NLRP3 inflammasome to abate ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor Progression Locus 2 Protects against Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Influenza A Virus-Infected Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35980186/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation in patients with severe influenza disease may lead to acute lung injury that results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is associated with alveolar damage and pulmonary edema that severely impair gas exchange, leading to hypoxia. With no existing FDA-approved treatment for ARDS, it is important to understand the factors that lead to virus-induced ARDS development to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We have previously shown that mice deficient in the serine-threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase, Tpl2 (MAP3K8 or COT), succumb to infection with a typically low-pathogenicity strain of influenza A virus (IAV; HKX31, H3N2 [x31]). The goal of the current study was to evaluate influenza A virus-infected &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice clinically and histopathologically to gain insight into the disease mechanism. We hypothesized that &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice succumb to IAV infection due to development of ARDS-like disease and pulmonary dysfunction. We observed prominent signs of alveolar septal necrosis, hyaline membranes, pleuritis, edema, and higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the lungs of IAV-infected &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice from 7 to 9 days postinfection (dpi). Notably, WT mice showed signs of regenerating epithelium, indicative of repair and recovery, that were reduced in &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Furthermore, biomarkers associated with human ARDS cases were upregulated in &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice at 7 dpi, demonstrating an ARDS-like phenotype in &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice in response to IAV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the protective role of the serine-threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase, Tpl2, in influenza virus pathogenesis and reveals that host Tpl2 deficiency is sufficient to convert a low-pathogenicity influenza A virus infection into severe influenza disease that resembles ARDS, both histopathologically and transcriptionally. The IAV-infected &lt;em&gt;Tpl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mouse thereby represents a novel murine model for studying ARDS-like disease that could improve our understanding of this aggressive disease and assist in the design of better diagnostics and treatments.

      <title>Vitamin-D ameliorates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via augmenting miR-149-5p and downregulating ER stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35988833/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury is a life-threatening medical problem induced by sepsis or endotoxins and may be associated with enhanced Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Vitamin-D (Vit-D) possesses an anti-inflammatory effect; however, this specific mechanism on acute lung injury is still unknown. Here we scrutinize the mechanism of Vit-D on Acute lung injury (ALI) models and explored the Vit-D augmented miRNA&amp;rsquo;s role in regulating the ER stress pathway in ALI. Sepsis was induced by CLP, and Endotoxemia was caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that Vit-D alleviates pulmonary edema, improves lung histoarchitecture, infiltration of neutrophils, endothelial barrier in mice, and improves ER stress markers Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) and CHOP (C/EBP Homologous Protein) expression elevated by CLP/LPS induce ALI. Vit-D decreases the nitric oxide production and ATF6 in macrophages induced by LPS. Vit-D augments miR (miR-149-5p) in LPS-induce macrophages, CLP, and LPS-induced ALI models. Vit-D enhanced miRNA-149-5p when overexpressed, inhibited ER-specific ATF6 inflammatory pathway in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and improved histoarchitecture of the lung in LPS/CLP-induced mice models. This vitro and vivo studies demonstrate that Vit-D could improve ALI induced by CLP/LPS. In this regard, miR-149-5p may play a crucial role in vitamin-D inhibiting LPS/CLP induce ALI. The mechanism might be an association of increased miR-149-5p and its regulated gene target ATF6, and downstream CHOP proteins were suppressed. Thus, these findings demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory effect of Vit-D is achieved by augmentation of miRNA-149-5p expression, which may be a key physiologic mediator in the prevention and treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acadesine alleviates acute pancreatitis-related lung injury by mediating the barrier protective function of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35987144/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretreatment with acadesine shows therapeutic potential SAP-ALI in vivo and vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endothelial injury is critical for the initiation and progression of severe acute pancreatitis-related acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The beneficial effects of acadesine may involve reducing ROS accumulation and inhibiting apoptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acadesine inhibits the impairment of SAP-ALI by activating the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a condition characterized by highly fatal acute inflammation and is usually associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Acute lung injury (ALI) is the most common complications of SAP, which is the accelerator of other organ dysfunction caused by SAP and the primary cause of early death due to SAP. Acadesine, an adenosine analog and an AMPK activator, has been discovered to modulate glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS. However, its role in SAP-ALI and its mechanism remains unclear and need to be explored. Herein, we discovered that acadesine mitigated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), alleviated apoptosis and recovered barrier integrity, thereby contributing to anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Nrf2 deficiency partially eliminated the effects of acadesine-induced antioxidant effects and thus weakened the protective effects on cells and Nrf2-knockout (Nrf2&lt;Sup&gt;-/-&lt;/Sup&gt;) mice. This study demonstrates that acadesine attenuated SAP-ALI associated inflammation and tissue damage by modulating the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway by triggering AMPK. These findings are of great significance for the treatment of SAP-related lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovery and evaluation of phenacrylanilide derivatives as novel potential anti-liver fibrosis agents</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36037790/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phenacrylanilide derivates inhibited TGF-Î²1- induced hepatic stellate cell proliferation and activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound 42 inhibited fibrotic markers expression with lower toxicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administration of compound 42 improved liver fibrosis and inhibited HSC activation in CCl4-induced mouse fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound 42 regulated unbalanced immune microenvironment &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver fibrosis is characterized by the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components and results from chronic liver injury. At present, there is no approved drug for the treatment of liver fibrosis by the Food and Drug Administration. Here, we have reported a series of novel compounds with phenacrylanilide scaffolds that potently inhibit the transfer growth factor Î²1 (TGF-Î²1)-induced activation of LX-2, a hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line. Among them, compound 42 suppressed TGF-Î²1-induced upregulation of fibrotic markers (Î±-SMA and fibronectin) and showed excellent safety in vitro. Furthermore, in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) -induced liver fibrosis model, 42 at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day through oral administration for 3 weeks effectively improved liver function, restored damaged liver structures, and reduced collagen deposition, with a greater effect than Tranilast. In addition, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is inhibited by compound 42 in the process of fibrosis. Meanwhile, the imbalanced immune microenvironment could also be effectively reversed. More interestingly, compound 42 prolongs the survival of CCl4 mice and ameliorates CCl4-induced injury to spleen, kidney, lung and heart. Altogether, these results suggest that 42 could be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of liver fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling in perivascular cells enhances inflammation and fibrosis in the kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35976996/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by sustained inflammation and progressive fibrosis, is highly prevalent and can eventually progress to end-stage kidney disease. However, current treatments to slow CKD progression are limited. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a product of sphingolipid catabolism, is a pleiotropic mediator involved in many cellular functions, and drugs targeting S1P signaling have previously been studied particularly for autoimmune diseases. The primary mechanism of most of these drugs is functional antagonism of S1P receptor-1 (S1P1) expressed on lymphocytes and the resultant immunosuppressive effect. Here, we documented the role of local S1P signaling in perivascular cells in the progression of kidney fibrosis using primary kidney perivascular cells and several conditional mouse models. S1P was predominantly produced by sphingosine kinase 2 in kidney perivascular cells and exported via spinster homolog 2 (Spns2). It bound to S1P1 expressed in perivascular cells to enhance production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines upon injury, leading to immune cell infiltration and subsequent fibrosis. A small-molecule Spns2 inhibitor blocked S1P transport, resulting in suppression of inflammatory signaling in human and mouse kidney perivascular cells in vitro and amelioration of kidney fibrosis in mice. Our study provides insight into the regulation of inflammation and fibrosis by S1P and demonstrates the potential of Spns2 inhibition as a treatment for CKD and potentially other inflammatory and fibrotic diseases that avoids the adverse events associated with systemic modulation of S1P receptors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion improves LPS-induced acute lung injury via gut-lung axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35981631/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute inflammatory disorder. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathology of ALI remain elusive. An increasing evidence suggests the role of the gut-microbiota axis in the pathology of lung injury. This study aimed to investigate whether antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion could affect ALI in mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; The effects of antibiotic cocktail (ABX) on ALI in the mice after intratracheally administration of LPS (5 mg/kg) were examined. Furthermore, 16s rRNA analysis and measurement of short-chain fatty acids in feces samples and metabolomics analysis of blood samples were performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; LPS significantly increased the interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of water-treated mice. Interestingly, an ABX significantly attenuated the LPS-induced increase in IL-6 in BALF and lung injury scores. Furthermore, ABX and/or LPS treatment markedly altered the Î±- and Î²-diversity of the gut microbiota. There were significant differences in the Î±- and Î²-diversity of the water + LPS group and ABX + LPS group. LEfSe analysis identified &lt;em&gt;Enterococusfaecalis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Clostriumtertium&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroidescaecimyris&lt;/em&gt; as potential microbial markers for ABX + LPS group. Untargeted metabolomics analysis identified several plasma metabolites responsible for discriminating water + LPS group from ABX + LPS group. There were correlations between the relative abundance of the microbiome and plasma metabolites. Integrative network analysis showed correlations between IL-6 levels in BALF and several gut microbes (or plasma metabolites).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; These data suggest that ABX-induced microbiome depletion could protect against LPS-induced ALI via the gut-microbiota-lung axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>miR-141 exacerbates lung ischemia-reperfusion injury by targeting EGFR/Î²-catenin axis-mediated autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35972910/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) injury. Here, this study aimed to examine whether miR-141 was related to lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) via regulating autophagy and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and to explore the underlying signal transduction pathways. To this end, we constructed the LIRI cell model and mouse models, separately. According to RT-qPCR and Western blotting (WB) analysis results, miR-141 up-regulation together with Î²-catenin and EGFR down-regulation within mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) or lung tissues was related to lung IRI. Besides, we conducted dual-luciferase reporter assay, which suggested the binding of EGFR to miR-141. In addition, we carried out TUNEL staining, HE staining, and flow cytometric analysis to assess the apoptosis of PMVECs and the injury to mouse lung tissues. Furthermore, we performed light-chain immunofluorescence assay to examine autophagosomes within PMVECs. According to our results, miR-141 suppressed Î²-catenin level through reducing EGFR level. Besides, the miR-141/EGFR/Î²-catenin axis enhanced autophagy to aggravate LIRI. To sum up, miR-141 suppresses EGFR expression to inhibit Î²-catenin level, which subsequently aggravates autophagy and complicates LIRI. The above results offer the candidate therapeutic target for the treatment of lung IRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protection against influenza-induced Acute Lung Injury (ALI) by enhanced induction of M2a macrophages: possible role of PPARÎ³/RXR ligands in IL-4-induced M2a macrophage differentiation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36052067/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many respiratory viruses cause lung damage that may evolve into acute lung injury (ALI), a cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and ultimately, death. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) family of transcription factors, regulates transcription by forming heterodimers with another NHR family member, Retinoid X Receptor (RXR). Each component of the heterodimer binds specific ligands that modify transcriptional capacity of the entire heterodimer by recruiting different co-activators/co-repressors. However, the role of PPARÎ³/RXR ligands in the context of influenza infection is not well understood. PPARÎ³ is associated with macrophage differentiation to an anti-inflammatory M2 state. We show that mice lacking the IL-4RÎ± receptor, required for M2a macrophage differentiation, are more susceptible to mouse-adapted influenza (A/PR/8/34; &amp;ldquo;PR8&amp;rdquo;)-induced lethality. Mice lacking &lt;em&gt;Ptgs2&lt;/em&gt;, that encodes COX-2, a key proinflammatory M1 macrophage mediator, are more resistant. Blocking the receptor for COX-2-induced Prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was also protective. Treatment with pioglitazone (PGZ), a PPARÎ³ ligand, increased survival from PR8 infection, decreased M1 macrophage gene expression, and increased PPARÎ³ mRNA in lungs. Conversely, conditional knockout mice expressing PPARÎ³-deficient macrophages were significantly more sensitive to PR8-induced lethality. These findings were extended in cotton rats: PGZ blunted lung inflammation and M1 cytokine gene expression after challenge with non-adapted human influenza. To study mechanisms by which PPARÎ³/RXR transcription factors induce canonical M2a genes, WT mouse macrophages were treated with IL-4 in the absence or presence of rosiglitazone (RGZ; PPARÎ³ ligand), LG100754 (LG; RXR ligand), or both. IL-4 dose-dependently induced M2a genes &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chil3&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Retnla&lt;/em&gt;. Treatment of macrophages with IL-4 and RGZ and/or LG differentially affected induction of &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;Chil3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Retnla&lt;/em&gt; gene expression. In PPARÎ³-deficient macrophages, IL-4 alone failed to induce &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; gene expression; however, concurrent treatment with LG or RGZ + LG enhanced IL-4-induced &lt;em&gt;Arg1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mrc1&lt;/em&gt; expression, but to a lower level than in WT macrophages, findings confirmed in the murine alveolar macrophage cell line, MH-S. These findings support a model in which PPARÎ³/RXR heterodimers control IL-4-induced M2a differentiation, and suggest that PPARÎ³/RXR agonists should be considered as important tools for clinical intervention against influenza-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a common public safety threat with high morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients worldwide. Qinbaohong Zhike oral liquid (QBH), a marketed traditional Chinese medicine product, has been widely used to cure respiratory diseases. QBH is reported to have antitussive, expectorant, and antiasthmatic properties. However, its treatment effect against ARIs is not elucidated. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic efficacy of QBH in the treatment of ARIs-induced pneumonia. Network pharmacology was used to predict the possible targets of QBH against ARIs. Next, the tracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS-)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) immature rat model was constructed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of QBH. Tandem mass tag (TMT-)-based quantitative proteomics was then used to screen the in-depth disease targets of QBH. QBH exerted a protective effect against LPS-induced ALI by inhibiting pulmonary pathological damage. QBH also reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interferon (IFN)-Î³, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the serum and IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-8, TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, and GM-CSF in the lung tissue. Based on proteomic data, olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) related to immunity and inflammation was selected as a potential target. Western blot analysis further confirmed the moderating effect of QBH downregulation on OLFM4 in the lung tissue. Our findings demonstrated that QBH alleviated lung tissue damage and inflammatory reaction via inhibiting OLFM4 expression in LPS-challenged immature rats. Our research indicates that QBH may have therapeutic potential for treating ARIs-related ALI in pediatric patients, which also serves as a candidate target for drug therapy of ALI by intervening OLFM-related signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a human lifespan, genome integrity erodes, leading to an increased abundance of several types of chromatin changes. The abundance of DNA lesions (chemical perturbations to nucleotides) increases with age, as does the number of genomic mutations and transcriptional disruptions caused by replication or transcription of those lesions, respectively. At the epigenetic level, precise DNA methylation patterns degrade, likely causing increasingly stochastic variations in gene expression. Similarly, the tight regulation of histone modifications begins to unravel. The genomic instability caused by these mechanisms allows transposon element reactivation and remobilization, further mutations, gene dysregulation, and cytoplasmic chromatin fragments. This cumulative genomic instability promotes cell signaling events that drive cell fate decisions and extracellular communications known to disrupt tissue homeostasis and regeneration.

      <title>Mechanisms of pulmonary endothelial permeability and inflammation caused by extracellular histone subunits H3 and H4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular DNA-binding proteins such as histones are danger-associated molecular pattern released by the injured tissues in trauma and sepsis settings, which trigger host immune response and vascular dysfunction. Molecular events leading to histone-induced endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction remain poorly understood. This study performed comparative analysis of H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histone subunits effects on human pulmonary EC permeability and inflammatory response. Analysis of transendothelial electrical resistance and EC monolayer permeability for macromolecues revealed that H3 and H4, but not H1, H2A, or H2B caused dose-dependent EC permeability accompanied by disassembly of adherens junctions. At higher doses, H3 and H4 activated nuclear factor kappa B inflammatory cascade leading to upregulation EC adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1, E-selectin, and release of inflammatory cytokines. Inhibitory receptor analysis showed that toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 but not TLR1/2 or receptor for advanced glycation end inhibition significantly attenuated deleterious effects of H3 and H4 histones. Inhibitor of Rho-kinase was without effect, while inhibition of Src kinase caused partial preservation of cell-cell junctions, H3/H4-induced permeability and inflammation. Deleterious effects of H3/H4 were blocked by heparin. Activation of Epac-Rap1 signaling restored EC barrier properties after histone challenge. Intravenous injection of histones in mice caused elevation of inflammatory markers and increased vascular leak. Post-treatment with pharmacological Epac/Rap1 activator suppressed injurious effects of histones in vitro and in vivo. These results identify H3 and H4 as key histone subunits exhibiting deleterious effects on pulmonary vascular endothelium via TLR4-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, elevation of circulating histones may represent a serious risk of exacerbated acute lung injury (ALI) and multiple organ injury during severe trauma and infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CuO-NPs-triggered heterophil extracellular traps exacerbate liver injury in chicks by promoting oxidative stress and inflammatory responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35962800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the widespread use of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NPs), their potential toxicity to the environment and biological health has attracted close attention. Heterophil extracellular traps (HETs) are an innate immune mechanism of chicken heterophils against adverse stimuli, but excessive HETs cause damage. Here, we explored the effect and mechanism of CuO-NPs on HETs formation in vitro and further evaluated the potential role of HETs in chicken liver and kidney injury. Heterophils were exposed to 5, 10, and 20 Âµg/mL of CuO-NPs for 2 h. The results showed that CuO-NPs induced typical HETs formation, which was dependent on NADPH oxidase, P38 and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) pathways, and glycolysis. In in vivo experiments, fluorescence microplate and morphological analysis showed that CuO-NPs elevated the level of HETs in chicken serum and caused liver and kidney damage. Meanwhile, CuO-NPs caused hepatic oxidative stress (MDA, SOD, CAT, and GSH-PX imbalance), and also induced an increase in mRNA expression of their inflammatory and apoptosis-related factors (IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î±, COX-2, iNOS, NLRP3, and Caspase-1, 3, 11). However, these results were significantly altered by DNase I (HETs degradation reagent). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that CuO-NPs induce the formation of HETs and that HETs exacerbate pathological damage in chicken liver and kidney by promoting oxidative stress and inflammation, providing insights into immunotoxicity and potential prevention and treatment targets caused by CuO-NPs overexposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macrophage SAMSN1 protects against sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35981417/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the progression of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). SAM domain, SH3 domain and nuclear localization signals 1 (SAMSN1) is a signaling adaptor protein, and mainly regulates inflammatory response of various immune cells. The present study generates macrophage-specific SAMSN1-knockout (Samsn1MKO) and SAMSN1-transgenic (Samsn1MTG) mice to investigate its role and mechanism in sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Samsn1&lt;sup&gt;MKO&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Samsn1&lt;sup&gt;MTG&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instillation or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery to induce sepsis-induced ALI. Bone marrow transplantation, cellular depletion and non-invasive adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were performed to validate the role of macrophage SAMSN1 in sepsis-induced ALI in vivo. Meanwhile, BMDMs were isolated from Samsn1MKO or Samsn1MTG mice to further clarify the role of SAMSN1 in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Macrophage SAMSN1 expression was increased in response to LPS stimulation, and negatively correlated with LPS-induced ALI in mice. Macrophage SAMSN1 deficiency exacerbated, while macrophage SAMSN1 overexpression ameliorated LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and ALI in mice and in BMDMs. Mechanistically, we found that macrophage SAMSN1 overexpression prevented LPS-induced ALI though activating AMP-activated protein kinase Î±2 (AMPKÎ±2) &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Further studies revealed that SAMSN1 directly bound to growth factor receptor bound protein 2-associated protein 1 (GAB1) to prevent its protein degradation, and subsequently enhanced protein kinase A (PKA)/AMPKÎ±2 activation in a protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11, also known as SHP2)-dependent manner. Moreover, we observed that macrophage SAMSN1 overexpression diminished CLP-induced ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study documents the protective role of macrophage SAMSN1 against sepsis-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and ALI through activating AMPKÎ±2 in a GAB1/SHP2/PKA pathway, and defines it as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target to treat sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Role of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Early Microthrombosis and Brain Injury After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35962915/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microthrombosis plays an important role in secondary brain injury after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but the specific mechanism of microthrombosis remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in microthrombosis after SAH. SAH was induced in male C57BL/6 mice using an endovascular perforation technique. The marker protein of NETs, citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), was significantly elevated in the cerebral cortex after SAH, and was co-labeled with microthrombi. Both depletion of neutrophils by anti-Ly6G antibody and DNase I treatment significantly reduced the formation of NETs and microthrombi, and ameliorated neurological deficits, brain edema, BBB disruption, and neuronal injury at 24 h after SAH induction. Cerebral hypoperfusion in the first hours after SAH is a major determinant of poor neurological outcome; in this study, we found that DNase I treatment significantly improved the restoration of early cortical perfusion after SAH. In addition, DNase I treatment also significantly attenuated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow after SAH, which was associated with the diffusion barrier caused by microthrombi in the paravascular space after SAH. In conclusion, NETs are associated with early microthrombosis after SAH; they may be a novel therapeutic target for early brain injury (EBI) after SAH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upregulating carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 attenuates hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and persistent lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35964084/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease in premature infants that may cause long-term lung dysfunction. Accumulating evidence supports the vascular hypothesis of BPD, in which lung endothelial cell dysfunction drives this disease. We recently reported that endothelial carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a) is reduced by hyperoxia, and that endothelial cell-specific Cpt1a knockout mice are more susceptible to developing hyperoxia-induced injury than wild type mice. Whether Cpt1a upregulation attenuates hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and lung injury remains unknown. We hypothesized that upregulation of Cpt1a by baicalin or L-carnitine ameliorates hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and persistent lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Lung endothelial cells or newborn mice (&amp;lt; 12 h old) were treated with baicalin or L-carnitine after hyperoxia (50% and 95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) followed by air recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that incubation with L-carnitine (40 and 80 mg/L) and baicalin (22.5 and 45 mg/L) reduced hyperoxia-induced apoptosis, impaired cell migration and angiogenesis in cultured lung endothelial cells. This was associated with increased Cpt1a gene expression. In mice, neonatal hyperoxia caused persistent alveolar and vascular simplification in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with L-carnitine (150 and 300 mg/kg) and baicalin (50 and 100 mg/kg) attenuated neonatal hyperoxia-induced alveolar and vascular simplification in adult mice. These effects were diminished in endothelial cell-specific Cpt1a knockout mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Upregulating Cpt1a by baicalin or L-carnitine ameliorates hyperoxia-induced lung endothelial cell dysfunction, and persistent alveolar and vascular simplification. These findings provide potential therapeutic avenues for using L-carnitine and baicalin as Cpt1a upregulators to prevent persistent lung injury in premature infants with BPD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zanubrutinib ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via regulating macrophage polarization</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35973369/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35973369/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zanubrutinib could relieve LPS induced lung injuries in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB pathway is involved in Zanubrutinib -mediated M1 macrophage polarization in RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zanubrutinib promotes M2 macrophage activation through regulating JAK/STAT6 and PI3K/AKT pathway in RAW264.7 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a disease characterized by pulmonary diffusion dysfunction and its exacerbation stage is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may develop to multiple organ failure and seriously threatens human health. ALI has high mortality rates and few effective treatments, thus effective protection measures for ALI are becoming increasingly important. Macrophages play a key regulatory role in the pathogenesis of ALI, and the degree of macrophage polarization is closely related to the severity and prognosis of ALI. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Zanubrutinib (ZB), a BTK small molecule inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of cell lymphoma, on macrophage polarization and acute lung injury. In the in vivo study, we constructed a mouse model of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury and found that ZB could improve the acute injury of mouse lungs by inhibiting the secretion of proinflammatory factors and promoting the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, reduce the number of inflammatory cells in alveolar lavage fluid, and then alleviate the inflammatory response. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that ZB could inhibit the M1 macrophage polarization and promote the M2 macrophage polarization. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that ZB could inhibit the macrophage M1 polarization via targeting BTK activation and inhibiting JAK2/STAT1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB signaling pathways, and promote the macrophage M2 polarization by promoting the activation of STAT6 and PI3K / Akt signaling pathways. In summary, ZB has shown therapeutic effect in LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, which provides a potential candidate drug to treat acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ischemia-Selective Cardioprotection by Malonate for Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35959683/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inhibiting SDH (succinate dehydrogenase), with the competitive inhibitor malonate, has shown promise in ameliorating ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, key for translation to the clinic is understanding the mechanism of malonate entry into cells to enable inhibition of SDH, its mitochondrial target, as malonate itself poorly permeates cellular membranes. The possibility of malonate selectively entering the at-risk heart tissue on reperfusion, however, remains unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6J mice, C2C12 and H9c2 myoblasts, and HeLa cells were used to elucidate the mechanism of selective malonate uptake into the ischemic heart upon reperfusion. Cells were treated with malonate while varying pH or together with transport inhibitors. Mouse hearts were either perfused ex vivo (Langendorff) or subjected to in vivo left anterior descending coronary artery ligation as models of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Succinate and malonate levels were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS, in vivo by mass spectrometry imaging, and infarct size by TTC (2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride) staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Malonate was robustly protective against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury, but only if administered at reperfusion and not when infused before ischemia. The extent of malonate uptake into the heart was proportional to the duration of ischemia. Malonate entry into cardiomyocytes in vivo and in vitro was dramatically increased at the low pH (â6.5) associated with ischemia. This increased uptake of malonate was blocked by selective inhibition of MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter 1). Reperfusion of the ischemic heart region with malonate led to selective SDH inhibition in the at-risk region. Acid-formulation greatly enhances the cardioprotective potency of malonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Cardioprotection by malonate is dependent on its entry into cardiomyocytes. This is facilitated by the local decrease in pH that occurs during ischemia, leading to its selective uptake upon reperfusion into the at-risk tissue, via MCT1. Thus, malonate&amp;rsquo;s preferential uptake in reperfused tissue means it is an at-risk tissue-selective drug that protects against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chlorogenic Acid Prevents Hyperuricemia Nephropathy via Regulating TMAO-Related Gut Microbes and Inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35950815/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperuricemia is an independent hazard factor of renal injury and can induce renal fibrosis, promoting the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to explore the probability of chlorogenic acid (CGA) as a potential substance for preventing hyperuricemia nephropathy (HN). Pretreatment with CGA downregulated SUA, BUN, and CR levels, relieved oxidative stress and inflammatory response, alleviated kidney fibrosis, and contributed to the prevention of HN. In the gut microbiota, &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Faecalibaculum&lt;/em&gt; related to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) synthesis were significantly increased in HN rats. In addition, it showed a significant increase in serum TMAO content in HN rats. However, CGA regulated the cascade response of the microbiota-TMAO signaling to reverse the increase of serum TMAO. CGA also decreased the protein expression of protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by reducing the production of TMAO. CGA delayed kidney fibrosis in HN rats as evidenced by regulating the cascade response of the microbiota-TMAO-PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In summary, CGA can be an excellent candidate for HN prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of the key ferroptosis-related genes involved in sepsis progression and experimental validation in vivo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ferroptosis has a vital role in sepsis, but the mechanism is not known. Understanding the mechanism of ferroptosis during sepsis will aid in developing improved therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used the Gene Expression Omnibus database and FerrDb database to obtain ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between sepsis patients and healthy volunteers (HVs). Analyses of PPI networks, functional enrichment, as well as use of the MCODE algorithm were used to identify key ferroptosis-related DEGs. Expression of key ferroptosis-related DEGs was verified using: GSE57065 and GSE65682 datasets; rats in which ferroptosis was induced with erastin; sepsis-induced acute lung injury (siALI) rats. The effects of acupoint catgut embedding (ACE) on ferroptosis and expression of key ferroptosis-related DEGs in the lungs of siALI rats were also observed. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to verify the effect of key ferroptosis-related DEGs on the survival of sepsis patients. Cytoscape was used to construct ceRNA networks and gene-transcription factor networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Between sepsis patients and HVs, we identified 33 ferroptosis-related DEGs. According to analyses of PPI networks and the MCODE algorithm, we obtained four modules, of which the most significant module contained nine ferroptosis-related DEGs. Functional-enrichment analyses showed that four of the nine DEGs were enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway: &lt;em&gt;MAPK14&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;VEGFA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TGFBR1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DUSP1&lt;/em&gt;. We verified expression of these four genes in GSE57065 and GSE65682 datasets and ferroptosis rats. In addition, expression of these four genes and that of the oxidative-stress indicators GSSG and MDA was upregulated, and glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4) expression was downregulated, in siALI rats, but ACE reversed these changes. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that survival of sepsis patients in the high-risk group was shorter than that in the low-risk group. We found that the XIST-hsa-let-7b-5p-TGFBR1/DUSP1 ceRNA network and transcription factor E2F1 may be important regulators of these four DEGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results suggest that &lt;em&gt;MAPK14&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;VEGFA,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;TGFBR1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DUSP1&lt;/em&gt; may be key regulatory targets of ferroptosis in sepsis, and that ACE pretreatment may be antioxidant treatment for sepsis and alleviate ferroptosis. These findings provide a basis for further ferroptosis-related study in sepsis and provide new targets for its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial quality control in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury: new insights into mechanisms and implications</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current effective method for the treatment of myocardial infarction is timely restoration of the blood supply to the ischemic area of the heart. Although reperfusion is essential for reestablishing oxygen and nutrient supplies, it often leads to additional myocardial damage, creating an important clinical dilemma. Reports from long-term studies have confirmed that mitochondrial damage is the critical mechanism in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Mitochondria are dynamic and possess a quality control system that targets mitochondrial quantity and quality by modifying mitochondrial fusion, fission, mitophagy, and biogenesis and protein homeostasis to maintain a healthy mitochondrial network. The system of mitochondrial quality control involves complex molecular machinery that is highly interconnected and associated with pathological changes such as oxidative stress, calcium overload, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Because of the critical role of the mitochondrial quality control systems, many reports have suggested that defects in this system are among the molecular mechanisms underlying myocardial reperfusion injury. In this review, we briefly summarize the important role of the mitochondrial quality control in cardiomyocyte function and focus on the current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and molecular pathways involved in mitochondrial quality control in cardiac I/R damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Morphological, cellular, and molecular basis of brain infection in COVID-19 patients</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although increasing evidence confirms neuropsychiatric manifestations associated mainly with severe COVID-19 infection, long-term neuropsychiatric dysfunction (recently characterized as part of &amp;ldquo;long COVID-19&amp;rdquo; syndrome) has been frequently observed after mild infection. We show the spectrum of cerebral impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, ranging from long-term alterations in mildly infected individuals (orbitofrontal cortical atrophy, neurocognitive impairment, excessive fatigue and anxiety symptoms) to severe acute damage confirmed in brain tissue samples extracted from the orbitofrontal region (via endonasal transethmoidal access) from individuals who died of COVID-19. In an independent cohort of 26 individuals who died of COVID-19, we used histopathological signs of brain damage as a guide for possible SARS-CoV-2 brain infection and found that among the 5 individuals who exhibited those signs, all of them had genetic material of the virus in the brain. Brain tissue samples from these five patients also exhibited foci of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, particularly in astrocytes. Supporting the hypothesis of astrocyte infection, neural stem cell-derived human astrocytes in vitro are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection through a noncanonical mechanism that involves spike-NRP1 interaction. SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes manifested changes in energy metabolism and in key proteins and metabolites used to fuel neurons, as well as in the biogenesis of neurotransmitters. Moreover, human astrocyte infection elicits a secretory phenotype that reduces neuronal viability. Our data support the model in which SARS-CoV-2 reaches the brain, infects astrocytes, and consequently, leads to neuronal death or dysfunction. These deregulated processes could contribute to the structural and functional alterations seen in the brains of COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Repair effect of photobiomodulation combined with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells on rats with acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36029758/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) impaired the function of blood oxygen exchange function, resulting in tissue hypoxia and patient death. Recently, human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) are thought to mitigate the effects of ALI, which boosts researchers&amp;rsquo; interest in employing stem cell-based therapies to manage ALI. However, as a novel therapy, hUCMSCs still face various limitations such as migrating weakly and insufficient proliferation in vivo. Photobiomodulation (PBM) effciently promotes cell proliferation, migration and homing, which presents a promising strategy for overcoming above limitations. In this study, PBM was emerged to intervene hUCMSCs through detecting cell proliferation, oxidative stress-related factors and inflammatory factors. These results assuredly confirmed that PBM enhanced the antioxidant capacity of cells and improved cell survival in vitro experiments. In vivo, PBM-intervened hUCMSCs intuitively reduce thickness of alveolar septum, excessive secretion of inflammatory factors, relieves bleeding, edema and fibrosis. As a physical intervention, PBM further strengthens the therapeutic effect of hUCMSCs and depicted a hopeful therapy in ALI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antioxidant Biodegradable Covalent Cyclodextrin Frameworks as Particulate Carriers for Inhalation Therapy against Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35948492/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug therapies for acute lung injury (ALI) are far from satisfactory, primarily because drugs cannot specifically target the lungs. Direct delivery of drugs to the deep alveolar regions by inhalation administration is crucial for the treatment of ALI. However, conventional inhalable carriers such as lactose and mannitol are generally inactive. Therefore, the use of a novel pharmacologically active carrier for pulmonary delivery may produce synergetic effects in treating ALI. Considering the pathophysiological environment of ALI, which typically featured excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acute inflammation, we synthesized a novel kind of biodegradable and ROS-sensitive cross-linked covalent cyclodextrin frameworks (OC-COF) with uniform inhalable particle size to treat ALI. OC-COF was devised to incorporate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-scavenging peroxalate ester linkages, which could hydrolyze and eliminate ROS generated in inflammatory sites. Ligustrazine (LIG), an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory natural compound, was loaded into OC-COF and evaluated as a dry powder inhaler (LIG@OC-COF) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, showing favorable aerodynamic properties and prominent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities for the synergistic effects of OC-COF and LIG. In ALI rats, inhalation of LIG@OC-COF with a one-fifth LIG dose significantly alleviated the inflammation, oxidant stress, and lung damage. Western blot analysis demonstrated that LIG@OC-COF protected the lungs by regulating the Nrf2/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. In summary, this study provides a novel ROS-responsive material as an inhalable particulate carrier for the improved treatment of ALI and other medical conditions.reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autoinducer-2 promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36033859/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that causes various acute and chronic lung infections in immunocompromised patients. We previously found that a quorum sensing (QS) signal, namely, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), facilitates the pathogenicity of the wild-type (WT) &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 strain &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. However, the immunological mechanism that leads to pulmonary injury remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of AI-2 on interleukin-17A (IL-17A) production during acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 lung infection using a mouse model, with an emphasis on the underlying immunological mechanism. Compared to infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 alone, infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 combined with AI-2 treatment resulted in significantly increased levels of IL-17A, numbers of Th17 cells and levels of STAT3 in the lung tissues of WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), as well as more serious lung damage. In contrast, the concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 and the chemokine keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) were significantly reduced during &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infection in IL-17A&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with WT mice (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and no effects were observed after AI-2 treatment (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the level of IL-17A in the lungs of WT mice was significantly reduced following infection with a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; strain harboring mutations in the QS genes &lt;em&gt;lasR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rhlR&lt;/em&gt; compared with the level of IL-17A following infection with &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1. Our data suggest that AI-2 promotes &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PAO1 acute lung infection via the IL-17A pathway by interfering with the QS systems of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. IL-17A may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of acute &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; lung infections in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal stromal cells-derived extracellular vesicles reprogramme macrophages in ARDS models through the miR-181a-5p-PTEN-pSTAT5-SOCS1 axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35948417/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; A better understanding of the mechanism of action of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) is needed to support their use as novel therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Macrophages are important mediators of ARDS inflammatory response. Suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins are key regulators of the macrophage phenotype switch. We therefore investigated whether SOCS proteins are involved in mediation of the MSC effect on human macrophage reprogramming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or plasma samples from patients with ARDS (these samples were previously classified into hypo-inflammatory and hyper-inflammatory phenotype) and treated with MSC conditioned medium (CM) or EVs. Protein expression was measured by Western blot. EV micro RNA (miRNA) content was determined by miRNA sequencing. In vivo: LPS-injured C57BL/6 mice were given EVs isolated from MSCs in which miR-181a had been silenced by miRNA inhibitor or overexpressed using miRNA mimic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; EVs were the key component of MSC CM responsible for anti-inflammatory modulation of human macrophages. EVs significantly reduced secretion of tumour necrosis factor-Î± and interleukin-8 by LPS-stimulated or ARDS plasma-stimulated MDMs and this was dependent on SOCS1. Transfer of miR-181a in EVs downregulated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and subsequently activated phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5) leading to upregulation of SOCS1 in macrophages. In vivo, EVs alleviated lung injury and upregulated pSTAT5 and SOCS1 expression in alveolar macrophages in a miR181-dependent manner. Overexpression of miR-181a in MSCs significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy of EVs in this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; miR-181a-PTEN-pSTAT5-SOCS1 axis is a novel pathway responsible for immunomodulatory effect of MSC EVs in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oridonin attenuates lung inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis via covalent targeting iNOS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36076611/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oridonin alleviates the progression of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oridonin inhibits silica-induced alveolar macrophage injury and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oridonin covalently targets iNOS and inhibits its level and activity, thereby providing a new potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of silicosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicosis, the most common type of pneumoconiosis, exhibits a high incidence in workers who are chronically exposed to crystalline silica (CS). No specific remedy for cure as yet. The terpenoid oridonin exerts multiple modulatory functions in neoplasms and inflammations as a natural compound. In this study, we explored the effect of oridonin on silicosis and revealed the underlying molecular mechanism. An experimental silicosis mouse model was established to evaluate the effects of oridonin on pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, the impact of oridonin on alveolar macrophages (AMs) was examined in the MH-S cell line. Its molecular target, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), was identified by chemobiological means, and virus-mediated gene overexpression systems confirmed that oridonin directly restrained iNOS protein levels. Oridonin alleviated pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis in silicosis mice with no obvious systemic toxicity. These effects were partially related to oridonin inhibition of CS-induced AMs injury and inflammation. Furthermore, oridonin suppressed iNOS enzymatic expression and activity by covalently binding to the Thr109 residue of the iNOS target. Thus, our results indicate oridonin as a potential iNOS enzymatic suppressor in experimental silicosis that attenuates pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis progression, which provides a therapeutic avenue for silicosis prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salvianolactone acid A isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice by regulating PPAR-Î³</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35985183/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Severe inflammation of the lungs results from acute lung injury (ALI), a common life-threatening lung disease with a high mortality rate. The ligand-activated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Î³ plays essential roles in diverse biological processes including inflammation, metabolism, development, and immune response. Salvianolactone acid A (SA) is a terpenoid derived from the herb Salvia miltiorrhiza. However, there is a scarcity of experimental evidence indicating whether the effect of SA on ALI occurs via PPAR-Î³.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; SA (20 or 40 mg/kg, i.g., 1 time/day) was administered to mice for 3 d, followed by the induction of ALI by intranasal lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg). The lung function and levels of inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), immune cells, apoptosis, and PPAR-Î³ were examined. The antagonistic activity of GW9662 (GW, 1 ÂµM, specific PPAR-Î³ blocker) and PPAR-Î³ transfection silencing against SA (10 Î¼M) in BEAS-2B cells induced by LPS (10 Î¼g/ml, 24 h) was also investigated to assess whether the observed effects caused by SA were mediated by PPAR-Î³.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that lung histopathological injury, the B-line, the fluorescence intensity of live small animal, and the biomarkers in BALF or lung in the treatment of SA could regulate significantly. In addition, SA obviously decreased the levels of ROS and apoptosis in the primary lung cells, and MDA, increased the levels of GSH-Px and SOD. SA reduced levels of macrophages and neutrophils. Furthermore, SA reduced the protein levels of Keap-1, Cleaved-caspase-3, Cleaved-caspase-9, p-p65/p65, NLRP3, IL-1Î², and upregulated the levels of p-Nrf2/Nrf2, HO-1, Bcl-2/Bax, PPAR-Î³, p-AMPK/AMPK in lung tissue. In addition, silencing and inhibition of PPAR-Î³ effectively decreased the protective effects of SA in BEAS-2B cells induced by LPS, which might indicate that the active molecules of SA regulate ALI via mediation by PPAR-Î³, which exhibited that the effect of SA related to PPAR-Î³.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The anti-ALI effects of SA were partially mediated through PPAR-Î³ signaling. These data provide the molecular justification for the usage of SA in treating ALI and can assist in increasing the comprehensive utilization rate of Salvia miltiorrhiza.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death worldwide1. Although advances have been made in acute treatment, an incomplete understanding of remodelling processes has limited the effectiveness of therapies to reduce late-stage mortality2. Here we generate an integrative high-resolution map of human cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction using single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility and spatial transcriptomic profiling of multiple physiological zones at distinct time points in myocardium from patients with myocardial infarction and controls. Multi-modal data integration enabled us to evaluate cardiac cell-type compositions at increased resolution, yielding insights into changes of the cardiac transcriptome and epigenome through the identification of distinct tissue structures of injury, repair and remodelling. We identified and validated disease-specific cardiac cell states of major cell types and analysed them in their spatial context, evaluating their dependency on other cell types. Our data elucidate the molecular principles of human myocardial tissue organization, recapitulating a gradual cardiomyocyte and myeloid continuum following ischaemic injury. In sum, our study provides an integrative molecular map of human myocardial infarction, represents an essential reference for the field and paves the way for advanced mechanistic and therapeutic studies of cardiac disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality. Currently, the primary treatment for ALI/ARDS is mainly symptomatic therapy such as mechanical ventilation and fluid management. Due to the lack of effective treatment strategies, most ALI/ARDS patients face a poor prognosis. The discovery of exosomes has created a promising prospect for the treatment of ALI/ARDS. Exosomes can exert anti-inflammatory effects, inhibit apoptosis, and promote cell regeneration. The microRNA contained in exosomes can participate in intercellular communication and play an immunomodulatory role in ALI/ARDS disease models. This review discusses the possible mechanisms of exosomes in ALI/ARDS to facilitate the development of innovative treatments for ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Erythropoietin mediates re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages through PI3K/AKT signaling and protects mice against secondary infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016936/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure leads to a hypo-responsive state by macrophages to a secondary stimulation of LPS, known as endotoxin tolerance. However, recent findings show that functions of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages are not completely suppressed, whereas they undergo a functional re-programming process with upregulation of a panel of molecules leading to enhanced protective functions including antimicrobial and tissue-remodeling activities. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF-1Î±), exerts anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective activities. Nevertheless, the potential effects of EPO on functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages have not been investigated yet. Here, we found that initial LPS exposure led to upregulation of HIF-1Î±/EPO in macrophages and that EPO enhanced tolerance in tolerized macrophages and mice as demonstrated by suppressed proinflammatory genes such as &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; after secondary LPS stimulation. Moreover, we showed that EPO improved host protective genes in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages and mice, such as the anti-bacterial genes coding for cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (&lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;) and macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (&lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;), and the tissue-repairing gene vascular endothelial growth factor C (&lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;). Therefore, our findings indicate that EPO mediates the functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages. Mechanistically, we found that PI3K/AKT signaling contributed to EPO-mediated re-programming through upregulation of &lt;em&gt;Irak3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wdr5&lt;/em&gt; expression. Specifically, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK3) was responsible for inhibiting proinflammatory genes &lt;em&gt;Il1b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Il6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tnfa&lt;/em&gt; in tolerized macrophages after LPS rechallenge, whereas WDR5 contributed to the upregulation of host beneficial genes including &lt;em&gt;Cnlp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Marco&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Vegfc&lt;/em&gt;. In a septic model of mice, EPO pretreatment significantly promoted endotoxin-tolerant re-programming, alleviated lung injury, enhanced bacterial clearance, and decreased mortality in LPS-tolerized mice after secondary infection of &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;. Collectively, our results reveal a novel role for EPO in mediating functional re-programming of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages; thus, targeting EPO appears to be a new therapeutic option in sepsis and other inflammatory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for acute respiratory failure: a review of potential indications, clinical practice and open research questions</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35943569/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) is a form of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) largely aimed at removing carbon dioxide in patients with acute hypoxemic or acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, so as to minimize respiratory acidosis, allowing more lung protective ventilatory settings which should decrease ventilator-induced lung injury. ECCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R is increasingly being used despite the lack of high-quality evidence, while complications associated with the technique remain an issue of concern. This review explains the physiological basis underlying the use of ECCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R, reviews the evidence regarding indications and contraindications, patient management and complications, and addresses organizational and ethical considerations. The indications and the risk-to-benefit ratio of this technique should now be carefully evaluated using structured national or international registries and large randomized trials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histopathological, physiological and biochemical assessment of resveratrol nanocapsules efficacy in bleomycin-induced acute and chronic lung injury in rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35945895/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening illness which may progress to chronic pulmonary fibrosis (CPF). Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenol, is known to exert several pharmacological effects on lung injury. However, its physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic profile limit its clinical applications. In this study, RSV was loaded into lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) aiming to overcome these limitations. RSV-LNCs were prepared by phase inversion method and showed small uniform particle size (â¼55 nm, PdI 0.04) with high entrapment efficiency &amp;gt;99%. The efficacy of RSV-LNCs in the prophylaxis against ALI and treatment of CPF was investigated in bleomycin-induced lung injury. For assessment of ALI, rats were administered a single oral dose of RSV (10 mg/kg) either free or as RSV-LNCs 4 h before bleomycin and euthanized 3 days later. For CPF, treatments in the same dose were given daily from days 10-20 after bleomycin and rats were euthanized on day-21. Results showed enhanced beneficial role for RSV-LNCs, compared to RSV, in the prevention of ALI as demonstrated by preservation of pulmonary microscopic and ultrastructural architecture and improvement of pulmonary functions. Analysis of BALF revealed reduction in oxidative stress markers, IL-6 level, leukocytosis and neutrophilia. iNOS and c-caspase 3 immunohistochemical expression and CD68+ cells immunofluorescence were inhibited. However, RSV-LNCs failed to show any improvement in oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, apoptosis and collagen deposition in CPF. In conclusion, RSV-LNCs are promising nanoplatforms for mitigating ALI detrimental effects. Future research investigating higher doses and longer durations of treatment is recommended to evaluate RSV-LNCs anti-fibrotic potential in CPF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) and &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin in vivo imaging detects pulmonary oxidative stress and cell death, respectively, in rats exposed to &amp;gt;95% O2 (hyperoxia) as a model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Preexposure to hyperoxia for 48 h followed by 24 h in room air (H-T) is protective against hyperoxia-induced lung injury. This study&amp;rsquo;s objective was to determine the ability of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO and &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin to track this protection and to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Rats were exposed to normoxia, hyperoxia for 60 h, H-T, or H-T followed by 60 h of hyperoxia (H-T + 60). Imaging was performed 20 min after intravenous injection of either &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO or &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin. &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO and &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin lung uptake was 200% and 167% greater (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) in hyperoxia compared with normoxia rats, respectively. On the other hand, uptake of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO in H-T + 60 was 24% greater (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) than in H-T rats, but &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin uptake was not significantly different (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.09). Lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, pleural effusion, endothelial filtration coefficient, and histological indices all showed evidence of protection and paralleled imaging results. Additional results indicate higher mitochondrial complex IV activity in H-T versus normoxia rats, suggesting that mitochondria of H-T lungs may be more tolerant of oxidative stress. A pattern of increasing lung uptake of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO and &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin correlates with advancing oxidative stress and cell death and worsening injury, whereas stable or decreasing &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO and stable &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-duramycin reflects hyperoxia tolerance, suggesting the potential utility of molecular imaging for identifying at-risk hosts that are more or less susceptible to progressing to ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Natriuretic peptide receptor-C mediates the inhibitory effect of atrial natriuretic peptide on neutrophil recruitment to the lung during acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35943160/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) protects against acute lung injury (ALI), but the receptor that mediates this effect is not known. Transgenic mice with 0 (knockout), 1 (heterozygote), or 2 (wild-type) functional copies of Npr3, the gene that encodes for natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C), were treated with intravenous infusion of ANP or saline vehicle before oropharyngeal aspiration of &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; (PA103) or saline vehicle. Lung injury was assessed 4 h following aspiration by measurement of lung wet/dry (W/D) weight, whole lung leukocyte and cytokine levels, and protein, leukocyte, and cytokine concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). PA103 induced acute lung injury as evidenced by increases in lung W/D ratio and protein concentration in BALF. The severity of PA103-induced lung injury did not differ between NPR-C genotypes. Treatment with intravenous ANP infusion reduced PA103-induced increases in lung W/D and BALF protein concentration in all three NPRC genotypes. PA103 increased the percentage of leukocytes that were neutrophils and cytokine levels in whole lung and BALF in NPR-C wild-type and knockout mice. This effect was blunted by ANP in wild-type mice but not in the NPR-C knockout mice. NPR-C does not mediate the protective effect of ANP on endothelial cell permeability in settings of PA103-induced injury but may mediate the effect of ANP on inhibition of the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and thereby attenuate the release of inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD-L1 maintains neutrophil extracellular traps release by inhibiting neutrophil autophagy in endotoxin-induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36016930/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is not only an important molecule in mediating tumor immune escape, but also regulates inflammation development. Here we showed that PD-L1 was upregulated on neutrophils in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Neutrophil specific knockout of PD-L1 reduced lung injury in ARDS model induced by intratracheal LPS injection. The level of NET release was reduced and autophagy is elevated by PD-L1 knockout in ARDS neutrophils both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Inhibition of autophagy could reverse the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 knockout on NET release. PD-L1 interacted with p85 subunit of PI3K at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in neutrophils from ARDS patients, activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. An extrinsic neutralizing antibody against PD-L1 showed a protective effect against ARDS. Together, PD-L1 maintains the release of NETs by regulating autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in ARDS. Anti-PD-L1 therapy may be a promising measure in treating ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Allyl methyl trisulfide protected against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice via inhibition of the NF-ÎºB and MAPK pathways</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allyl methyl trisulfide (AMTS) is one major lipid-soluble organosulfur compound of garlic. Previous studies have reported the potential therapeutic effect of garlic on acute lung injury (ALI) or its severe condition acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the specific substances that exert the regulatory effects are still unclear. In this study, we investigate the protective effects of AMTS on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice and explored the underlying mechanisms. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments, ICR mice were pretreated with 25-100 mg/kg AMTS for 7 days and followed by intratracheal instillation of LPS (1.5 mg/kg). The results showed that AMTS significantly attenuated LPS-induced deterioration of lung pathology, demonstrated by ameliorative edema and protein leakage, and improved pulmonary histopathological morphology. Meanwhile, the expression of inflammatory mediators and the infiltration of inflammation-regulation cells induced by LPS were also inhibited. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments also revealed that AMTS could alleviate inflammation response and inhibit the exaggeration of macrophage M1 polarization in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, we identified that AMTS treatment could attenuate the LPS-induced elevation of protein expression of p-IÎºBÎ±, nuclear NF-ÎºB-p65, COX2, iNOS, p-P38, p-ERK1/2, and p-JNK. Collectively, these data suggest that AMTS could attenuate LPS-induced ALI and the molecular mechanisms should be related to the suppression of the NF-ÎºB and MAPKs pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cangma Huadu granules attenuate H1N1 virus-induced severe lung injury correlated with repressed apoptosis and altered gut microbiome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36090063/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe influenza A virus infection leads to overwhelming inflammatory responses and cellular apoptosis, which causes lung injury and contributes to high mortality and morbidity. The gut microbiome altered in response to the infection might influence the disease progression and the treatment outcome. Cangma Huadu (CMHD) granules, an in-hospital preparation of traditional Chinese medicine, have been shown to be favorable in the clinical treatment of influenza. However, the effects and mechanisms of CMHD granules on severe influenza pneumonia and its mechanisms are not well-known. In this study, a lethal influenza A (H1N1) A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (PR8)-infected mice model was established, and the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) V3-V4 region sequencing of the intestinal microbiome was conducted. We revealed that the oral administration of CMHD granules protects mice against higher mortality, enhanced weight loss, overwhelmed interferon-Î³ concentration, lung viral titers, and severe lung pathological injury in PR8-infected mice. CMHD granules&amp;rsquo; administration downregulated the levels of interleukin (IL)-1Î², tumor necrosis factor-Î±, and malondialdehyde, while it upregulated the levels of IL-10, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. Subsequently, it decreased the protein ratio of B-cell lymphoma-2/Bcl-2-associated X and the expression of cleaved caspase-3. The diversity and compositions of the gut microbes were altered profoundly after the administration of CMHD granules in PR8-infected mice. A higher abundance of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parasutterella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Faecalibaculum&lt;/em&gt; was observed in the CMHD group, and a higher abundance of &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Turicibacter&lt;/em&gt; was observed in the positive drug Ribavirin group. The linear discriminant analysis effect size also revealed a higher proportion of &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium_pseudolongum&lt;/em&gt; characterized in the CMHD group. These results demonstrated that CMHD granules are a promising strategy for managing severe influenza and attenuating severe lung damage via reducing viral titer, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress. The mechanisms are involved in repressed Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis and altered composition and diversity of the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Galectin-3 inhibitor GB0139 protects against acute lung injury by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment and activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36003515/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Galectin-3 (Gal-3) drives fibrosis during chronic lung injury, however, its role in acute lung injury (ALI) remains unknown. Effective pharmacological therapies available for ALI are limited; identifying novel concepts in treatment is essential. GB0139 is a Gal-3 inhibitor currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We investigate the role of Gal-3 in ALI and evaluate whether its inhibition with GB0139 offers a protective role. The effect of GB0139 on ALI was explored &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The pharmacokinetic profile of intra-tracheal (i.t.) GB0139 was investigated in C57BL/6 mice to support the daily dosing regimen. GB0139 (1-30 Âµg) was then assessed following acute i.t. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bleomycin administration. Histology, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALf) analysis, and flow cytometric analysis of lung digests and BALf were performed. The impact of GB0139 on cell activation and apoptosis was determined &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; using neutrophils and THP-1, A549 and Jurkat E6 cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; GB0139 decreased inflammation severity via a reduction in neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and neutrophil activation. GB0139 reduced LPS-mediated increases in interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, GB0139 inhibited Gal-3-induced neutrophil activation, monocyte IL-8 secretion, T cell apoptosis and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes encoding for IL-8, TNFÎ±, IL-6 in alveolar epithelial cells in response to mechanical stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These data indicate that Gal-3 adopts a pro-inflammatory role following the early stages of lung injury and supports the development of GB0139, as a potential treatment approach in ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil trogocytosis during their trans-endothelial migration: role of extracellular CIRP</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35941574/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35941574/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Neutrophils are the most abundant innate immune cells in the circulating blood, and they act as the first responder against bacterial and fungal infection. However, accumulation of activated neutrophils can cause severe inflammation and tissue damage. Recently, neutrophil trogocytosis or membrane transfer with neighboring cells was reported to modulate immune responses. Extracellular cold-inducible RNA binding protein (eCIRP) is a newly identified damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). eCIRP can activate neutrophils to be more pro-inflammatory. This study aimed to identify the role of eCIRP in neutrophil trogocytosis during their trans-endothelial migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A trans-endothelial migration (TEM) assay using bone marrow neutrophils and mouse primary lung vascular endothelial cells was conducted using transwell chambers and neutrophil trogocytosis was assessed in vitro. In an in vivo mouse model of acute lung injury, neutrophil trogocytosis was assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In TEM assay, the trogocytosis of neutrophils occurred during trans-endothelial migration and eCIRP significantly increased the percentage of these neutrophils. The trogocytosed neutrophils acquired the endothelial membrane containing junctional adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C) and VE-cadherin, and these membrane patches were polarized by Mac-1 binding. Furthermore, eCIRP-induced JAM-C positive trogocytosed neutrophils are more pro-inflammatory than the JAM-C negative counterpart. JAM-C positive trogocytosed neutrophils were also observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a mouse model of acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These data suggest that during the paracellular trans-endothelial migration of neutrophils in response to inflammation, eCIRP induces trogocytosis of neutrophils, and the trogocytosed neutrophils exhibit an exaggerated pro-inflammatory phenotype promoting acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Caveolin-1 identified as a key mediator of acute lung injury using bioinformatics and functional research</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35933468/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a potentially life-threatening, devastating disease with an extremely high rate of mortality. The underlying mechanism of ALI is currently unclear. In this study, we aimed to confirm the hub genes associated with ALI and explore their functions and molecular mechanisms using bioinformatics methods. Five microarray datasets available in GEO were used to perform Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the key genes were identified via the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Lipopolysaccharide intraperitoneal injection was administered to establish an ALI model. Overall, 40 robust DEGs, which are mainly involved in the inflammatory response, protein catabolic process, and NF-ÎºB signaling pathway were identified. Among these DEGs, we identified two genes associated with ALI, of which the CAV-1/NF-ÎºB axis was significantly upregulated in ALI, and was identified as one of the most effective targets for ALI prevention. Subsequently, the expression of CAV-1 was knocked down using AAV-shCAV-1 or CAV-1-siRNA to study its effect on the pathogenesis of ALI in vivo and in vitro. The results of this study indicated that CAV-1/NF-ÎºB axis levels were elevated in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by an increase in lung inflammation and autophagy. The knockdown of CAV-1 may improve ALI. Mechanistically, inflammation was reduced mainly by decreasing the expression levels of CD3 and F4/80, and activating autophagy by inhibiting AKT/mTOR and promoting the AMPK signaling pathway. Taken together, this study provides crucial evidence that CAV-1 knockdown inhibits the occurrence of ALI, suggesting that the CAV-1/NF-ÎºB axis may be a promising therapeutic target for ALI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dysregulation of the kallikrein-kinin system in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with severe COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35939907/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35939907/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a critical component of the kallikrein-kinin system. Its dysregulation may lead to increased vascular permeability and release of inflammatory chemokines. Interactions between the kallikrein-kinin and the coagulation system might further contribute to thromboembolic complications in COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In this observational study, we measured plasma and tissue kallikrein hydrolytic activity, levels of kinin peptides, and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA complexes as a biomarker for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with and without COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Findings:&lt;/em&gt; In BAL fluid from patients with severe COVID-19 (n = 21, of which 19 were mechanically ventilated), we observed higher tissue kallikrein activity (18Â·2 pM [1Â·2-1535Â·0], median [range], n = 9 vs 3Â·8 [0Â·0-22Â·0], n = 11; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0Â·030), higher levels of the kinin peptide bradykinin-(1-5) (89Â·6 [0Â·0-2425Â·0], n = 21 vs 0Â·0 [0Â·0-374Â·0], n = 19, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0Â·001), and higher levels of MPO-DNA complexes (699Â·0 ng/mL [66Â·0-142621Â·0], n = 21 vs 70Â·5 [9Â·9-960Â·0], n = 19, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0Â·001) compared to patients without COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/em&gt; Our observations support the hypothesis that dysregulation of the kallikrein-kinin system might occur in mechanically ventilated patients with severe pulmonary disease, which might help to explain the clinical presentation of patients with severe COVID-19 developing pulmonary oedema and thromboembolic complications. Therefore, targeting the kallikrein-kinin system should be further explored as a potential treatment option for patients with severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of programmed cell death-related gene signature and associated regulatory axis in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35991562/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35991562/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Numerous studies have suggested that programmed cell death (PCD) pathways play vital roles in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the specific mechanisms underlying cell death during cerebral I/R injury have yet to be completely clarified. There is thus a need to identify the PCD-related gene signatures and the associated regulatory axes in cerebral I/R injury, which should provide novel therapeutic targets against cerebral I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We analyzed transcriptome signatures of brain tissue samples from mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and matched controls, and identified differentially expressed genes related to the three types of PCD(apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis). We next performed functional enrichment analysis and constructed PCD-related competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks. We also conducted hub gene analysis to identify hub nodes and key regulatory axes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Fifteen PCD-related genes were identified. Functional enrichment analysis showed that they were particularly associated with corresponding PCD-related biological processes, inflammatory response, and reactive oxygen species metabolic processes. The apoptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network was constructed, which included 24 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), 41 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 4 messenger RNAs (mRNAs); the necroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network included 16 lncRNAs, 20 miRNAs, and 6 mRNAs; and the pyroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network included 15 lncRNAs, 18 miRNAs, and 6 mRNAs. Hub gene analysis identified hub nodes in each PCD-related ceRNA regulatory network and seven key regulatory axes in total, namely, lncRNA Malat1/miR-181a-5p/Mapt, lncRNA Malat1/miR-181b-5p/Mapt, lncRNA Neat1/miR-181a-5p/Mapt, and lncRNA Neat1/miR-181b-5p/Mapt for the apoptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network; lncRNA Neat1/miR-181a-5p/Tnf for the necroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network; lncRNA Malat1/miR-181c-5p/Tnf for the pyroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory network; and lncRNAMalat1/miR-181a-5p for both necroptosis-related and pyroptosis-related ceRNA regulatory networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The results of this study supported the hypothesis that these PCD pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and PANoptosis) and crosstalk among them might be involved in ischemic stroke and that the key nodes and regulatory axes identified in this study might play vital roles in regulating the above processes. This may offer new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying cell death during cerebral I/R injury and provide new therapeutic targets for neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USP25 Deficiency Exacerbates Acute Pancreatitis via Up-Regulating TBK1-NF-ÎºB Signaling in Macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35934222/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; Severe acute pancreatitis can easily lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome and death. Macrophages are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis (AP), and macrophage activation correlates with disease severity. In this study, we examined the role of ubiquitin-specific protease 25, a deubiquitinating enzyme and known regulator of macrophages, in the pathogenesis of AP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used L-arginine, cerulein, and choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet-induced models of AP in &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice and wild-type mice. We also generated bone marrow &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; chimeric mice and initiated L-arginine-mediated AP. Primary acinar cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from wild-type and &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice to dissect molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our results show that Usp25 deficiency exacerbates pancreatic and lung injury, neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, and systemic inflammatory responses in L-arginine, cerulein, and choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet-induced models of AP. Bone marrow &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; chimeric mice challenged with L-arginine show that &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in macrophages exaggerates AP by up-regulating the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway. Similarly, in vitro data confirm that Usp25 deficiency enhances the TBK1-NF-ÎºB pathway, leading to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow-derived macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Usp25&lt;/em&gt; deficiency in macrophages enhances TBK1-NF-ÎºB signaling, and the induction of inflammatory chemokines and type I interferon-related genes exacerbates pancreatic and lung injury in AP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Noninvasive imaging of the lung NETosis by anti-Ly6G iron oxide nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35991979/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is challenging to visualize noninvasively the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, known as NETosis, and therefore difficult to monitor disease progression. A desirable molecular imaging probe is the iron oxide nanoparticle (NP) that could induce reactive oxygen species. Here, we used C57BL/6 mice with pristane-induced lupus, which mimics systemic lupus erythematosus. Administration of anti-Ly6G antibody-conjugated NP allowed detection of NETosis with fluorescent molecular imaging, as evidenced by flow cytometric analysis of citrullinated histone H3 expression in lung neutrophils. This finding was consistent with NP-induced blood NETosis in a spontaneous lupus model of B6.MRL-&lt;em&gt;lpr&lt;/em&gt; mice. &lt;em&gt;A chronic&lt;/em&gt; assessment was performed in which the lupus mice were protected from enhanced oxidative burst by anti-Ly6G NP. This NP can migrate from the peritoneal cavity to the lungs, as visualized by magnetic particle imaging. Overall, our study provides evidence for a highly sensitive assessment of NETosis in lupus through magnetic particle imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Piceatannol-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway inhibition contributes to the alleviation of oxidative injury and collagen synthesis during pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35932616/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piceatannol lightened oxidative injury and collagen synthesis in lung tissues during pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piceatannol inhibited the activation and collagen synthesis of TGF-Î²-induced lung fibroblasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAK2 activation abolished the effects of piceatannol in TGF-Î²-induced lung fibroblasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is characterized by oxidative injury and excessive collagen synthesis in lung fibroblasts, causing impaired pulmonary function and chronic lung injury. Piceatannol, a dietary polyphenol, possesses vital pharmacological effects in metabolic disorders, cancers, cardiovascular disease and infectious disease; however, its role in PF is still not completely elucidated. Mice (8 to 10 weeks old) were administered bleomycin (BLM) intratracheally (2 U/kg) to establish an in vivo PF model. Murine primary lung fibroblasts were isolated and stimulated with TGF-Î² (10 ng/mL) for 48 h to induce its activation. Meanwhile, mice or primary lung fibroblasts were treated with different doses of piceatannol to observe its protective roles. Pulmonary function and arterial blood gas were detected to assess pulmonary physiological status. Collagen deposition and the mRNA levels of profibrotic genes were determined by H&amp;amp;E staining and RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the protein and mRNA markers, as well as end-product of oxidative stress were detected in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that pulmonary function was significantly impaired in BLM-induced mice, accompanied by elevated oxidative stress and excessive collagen synthesis. Piceatannol significantly improved pulmonary function and decreased oxidative injury as well as collagen synthesis in mice with PF. Mechanically, piceatannol treatment significantly inhibited the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in BLM-induced mice and TGF-Î²-induced lung fibroblasts. Additional findings also demonstrated that coumermycin A1 (C-A1), an agonist of JAK2, could abolish the effects of piceatannol on TGF-Î²-induced lung fibroblasts and reactivated the phosphorylation STAT3. Taken together, our study demonstrated that piceatannol could protect against oxidative injury and collagen synthesis during PF in a JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent evidence for toxic effects of NH3 exposure on lung injury: Protective effects of L-selenomethionine</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35999759/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ammonia is a typical air pollutant, which has a strong toxic effect on respiratory system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ammonia exposure causes lung damage by oxidative stress and energy metabolism disorder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROS-mediated excessive autophagy is important mechanisms of ammonia toxicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L-selenomethionine can mitigate the toxic effect of ammonia exposure on lungs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a common air pollutant, which poses a serious threat to farm animals. L-selenomethionine is organic selenium (Se), which can inhibit intracellular ROS generation, block ROS-dependent autophagy, promote mitochondrial energy metabolism, and enhance the body&amp;rsquo;s immunity. Lung, as an important organ of the respiratory system, is highly susceptible to the toxic effects of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. However, there were few studies on the mechanism of toxic effects of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on lung tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on the lungs in pigs and the alleviating effect of L-selenomethionine. Twenty-four Large White-Duroc-Min pigs were randomly assigned to 4 groups: control group, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group, Se group, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +Se group. The results showed that exposure to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; caused damage and inflammation in lung tissues and significantly increased blood NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; concentration. NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; induced changes of oxidative stress indexes (GSH, GSH-Px, SOD, MDA, Keap1, Nrf2, and HO-1) and expressions of energy metabolism related genes (HK1, HK2, PFK, PK, LDHA, and HIF-1Î±). Ultrastructure showed that mitochondrial damage and autophagosome increased significantly, and the expression levels of autophagy related genes (Beclin1, ATG5, ATG7, ATG10, and p62) changed. However, the addition of L-selenomethionine alleviated the above changes, but there was still a significant difference compared with the control group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). This finding can provide a new evidence for mitigation of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Streptococcal autolysin promotes dysfunction of swine tracheal epithelium by interacting with vimentin</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35921364/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a major zoonotic pathogen resulting in manifestations as pneumonia and septic shock. The upper respiratory tract is typically thought to be the main colonization and entry site of SS2 in pigs, but the mechanism through which it penetrates the respiratory barrier is still unclear. In this study, a mutant with low invasive potential to swine tracheal epithelial cells (STECs) was screened from the TnYLB-1 transposon insertion mutant library of SS2, and the interrupted gene was identified as autolysin (atl). Compared to wild-type (WT) SS2, Îatl mutant exhibited lower ability to penetrate the tracheal epithelial barrier in a mouse model. Purified Atl also enhanced SS2 translocation across STEC monolayers in Transwell inserts. Furthermore, Atl redistributed the tight junctions (TJs) in STECs through myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) signaling, which led to increased barrier permeability. Using mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), pull-down, bacterial two-hybrid and saturation binding experiments, we showed that Atl binds directly to vimentin. CRISPR/Cas9-targeted deletion of vimentin in STECs (VIM KO STECs) abrogated the capacity of SS2 to translocate across the monolayers, SS2-induced phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) and MLCK transcription, indicating that vimentin is indispensable for MLCK activation. Consistently, vimentin null mice were protected from SS2 infection and exhibited reduced tracheal and lung injury. Thus, MLCK-mediated epithelial barrier opening caused by the Atl-vimentin interaction is found to be likely the key mechanism by which SS2 penetrates the tracheal epithelium.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Total flavonoids of Inula japonica alleviated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in LPS-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting the sEH activity: Insights from lipid metabolomics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150346/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe respiratory disease characterized by diffuse lung interstitial and respiratory distress and pulmonary edema with a mortality rate of 35%-40%. Inula japonica Thunb., known as &amp;ldquo;Xuan Fu Hua&amp;rdquo; in Chinese, is a traditional Chinese medicine Inulae Flos to use for relieving cough, eliminating expectorant, and preventing bacterial infections in the clinic, and possesses an anti-pulmonary fibrosis effect. However, the effect and action mechanism of I. japonica on ALI is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanism of total flavonoids of I. japonica (TFIJ) in the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design and methods:&lt;/em&gt; A mouse ALI model was established through administration of LPS by the intratracheal instillation. Protective effects of TFIJ in the inflammation and oxidative stress were studied in LPS-induced ALI mice based on inflammatory and oxidative stress factors, including MDA, MPO, SOD, and TNF-Î±. Lipid metabolomics, bioinformatics, Western blot, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry were performed to reveal the potential mechanism of TFIJ in the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; TFIJ significantly alleviated the interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells and the collapse of the alveoli in LPS-induced ALI mice. Lipid metabolomics demonstrated that TFIJ could significantly affect the CYP2J/sEH-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism, such as 11,12-EET, 14,15-EET, 8,9-DHET, 11,12-DHET, and 14,15-DHET, revealing that sEH was the potential target of TFIJ, which was further supported by the recombinant sEH-mediated the substrate hydrolysis in vitro (IC50 = 1.18 Î¼g/ml). Inhibition of sEH by TFIJ alleviated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress via the MAPK, NF-ÎºB, and Nrf2 signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; These results demonstrated that TFIJ could suppress the sEH activity to stabilize the level of EETs, allowing the alleviation of the pathological course of lung injury in LPS-treated mice, which suggested that TFIJ could serve as the potential agents in the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel circular RNA, circIgfbp2, links neural plasticity and anxiety through targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress-induced synapse dysfunction after traumatic brain injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35918398/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to different neurological and psychiatric disorders. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly expressed in the nervous system and enriched in synapses; yet, the underlying role and mechanisms of circRNAs in neurological impairment and dysfunction are still not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the expression of circRNAs and their relation with neurological dysfunction after TBI. RNA-Seq was used to detect differentially expressed circRNAs in injured brain tissue, revealing that circIgfbp2 was significantly increased. Up-regulated hsa_circ_0058195, which was highly homologous to circIgfbp2, was further confirmed in the cerebral cortex specimens and serum samples of patients after TBI. Moreover, correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between hsa_circ_0058195 levels and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale scores in these subjects. Furthermore, knockdown of circIgfbp2 in mice relieved anxiety-like behaviors and sleep disturbances induced by TBI. Knockdown of circIgfbp2 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treated HT22 cells alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction, while its overexpression reversed the process. Mechanistically, we discovered that circIgfbp2 targets miR-370-3p to regulate BACH1, and down-regulating BACH1 alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress-induced synapse dysfunction. In conclusion, inhibition of circIgfbp2 alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress-induced synapse dysfunction after TBI through the miR-370-3p/BACH1/HO-1 axis. Thus, circIgfbp2 might be a novel therapeutic target for anxiety and sleep disorders after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Persistent DNA damage underlies tubular cell polyploidization and progression to chronic kidney disease in kidneys deficient in the DNA repair protein FAN1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35931300/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defective DNA repair pathways contribute to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in humans. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA damage-induced CKD pathogenesis are not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of tubular cell DNA damage in the pathogenesis of CKD using mice in which the DNA repair protein Fan1 was knocked out. The phenotype of these mice is orthologous to the human DNA damage syndrome, karyomegalic interstitial nephritis (KIN). Inactivation of Fan1 in kidney proximal tubule cells sensitized the kidneys to genotoxic and obstructive injury characterized by replication stress and persistent DNA damage response activity. Accumulation of DNA damage in Fan1 tubular cells induced epithelial dedifferentiation and tubular injury. Characteristic to KIN, cells with chronic DNA damage failed to complete mitosis and underwent polyploidization. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that polyploidization was caused by the overexpression of DNA replication factors CDT1 and CDC6 in FAN1 deficient cells. Mechanistically, inhibiting DNA replication with Roscovitine reduced tubular injury, blocked the development of KIN and mitigated kidney function in these Fan1 knockout mice. Thus, our data delineate a mechanistic pathway by which persistent DNA damage in the kidney tubular cells leads to kidney injury and development of CKD. Furthermore, therapeutic modulation of cell cycle activity may provide an opportunity to mitigate the DNA damage response induced CKD progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phosgene-Induced acute lung injury: Approaches for mechanism-based treatment strategies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35983054/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosgene (COCl2) gas is a chemical intermediate of high-volume production with numerous industrial applications worldwide. Due to its high toxicity, accidental exposure to phosgene leads to various chemical injuries, primarily resulting in chemical-induced lung injury due to inhalation. Initially, the illness is mild and presents as coughing, chest tightness, and wheezing; however, within a few hours, symptoms progress to chronic respiratory depression, refractory pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, which may contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even death in severe cases. Despite rapid advances in medicine, effective treatments for phosgene-inhaled poisoning are lacking. Elucidating the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of acute inhalation toxicity caused by phosgene is necessary for the development of appropriate therapeutics. In this review, we discuss extant literature on relevant mechanisms and therapeutic strategies to highlight novel ideas for the treatment of phosgene-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accurate identification of kidney injury progression via a fluorescent biosensor array</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the progress of kidney injury may aid the effective treatment and intervention. Herein, we developed a fluorescent biosensor array for instantaneous and accurate identification of the kidney injury progression via &amp;ldquo;doubled&amp;rdquo; signals. The multichannel biosensor array consisted of polydopamine-polyethyleneimine (PDA-PEI) and multicolor-labelled different length of DNAs including AAAAA-Cyanine7 (5A-Cy7), AAAAAAAAAA-Texas Red (10A-Texas Red), and AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-VIC (20A-VIC). Facing to the variety of protein in urine with alterable charge accompanied with different progress of kidney injury, the composition of urine replaces the DNA signal molecules, forming their special fluorescence patterns. Taking the size of protein into consideration, the original three variables induced by the protein charge were extended to six variables induced by the two factors of protein particle size and charge difference, which could provide a more accurate strategy to identify the progress of kidney injury. Notably, this strategy not only opened up new perspective for identification the progress of kidney injury via the size and charge of urine protein, but also improved the resolving power of sensor array by increasing the number of sensor elements for extending their potential application to various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cysteinyl Maresins Reprogram Macrophages to Protect Mice from Streptococcus pneumoniae after Influenza A Virus Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35913160/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Excess mortality during IAV epidemics and pandemics is attributable to secondary bacterial infections, particularly pneumonia caused by &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;. Resident alveolar macrophages (rAMs) are early responders to respiratory infections that coordinate initial host defense responses. Maresin conjugates in tissue regeneration (MCTRs) are recently elucidated cysteinyl maresins that are produced by and act on macrophages. Roles for MCTRs in responses to respiratory infections remain to be determined. Here, IAV infection led to transient decreases in rAM numbers. Repopulated lung macrophages displayed transcriptional alterations 21 days post-IAV with prolonged susceptibility to secondary pneumococcal infection. Administration of a mix of MCTR1 to 3 or MCTR3 alone post-IAV decreased lung inflammation and bacterial load 48 and 72 h after secondary pneumococcal infection. MCTR-exposed rAMs had increased migration and phagocytosis of &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, reduced secretion of CXCL1, and a reversion toward baseline levels of several IAV-induced pneumonia susceptibility genes. Together, MCTRs counter regulated post-IAV changes in rAMs to promote a rapid return of bacteria host defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a serious and common complication of IAV infection, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. New host-directed approaches are needed to complement antibiotics to better address this important global infectious disease. Here, we show that harnessing endogenous resolution mechanisms for inflammation by exogenous administration of a family of specialized proresolving mediators (i.e., cys-MCTRs) increased macrophage resilience mechanisms after IAV to protect against secondary infection from &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular histones induce inflammation and senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells by activating the AMPK/FOXO4 signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35913584/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is an abnormal immune-inflammatory response that is mainly caused by infection. It can lead to life-threatening organ dysfunction and death. Severely damaged tissue cells will release intracellular histones into the circulation as damage-related molecular patterns (DAMPs) to accelerate the systemic immune response. Although various histone-related cytotoxicity mechanisms have been explored, those that affect extracellular histones involved in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction are yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were stimulated with different concentrations of histones, and cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay. Cellular senescence was assessed by SA Î²-gal staining. C57BL/6 mice were treated with histones with or without BML-275 treatment. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 inflammasome proteins. The interaction of NLRP3 and ASC was detected by CoIP and immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we found that extracellular histones induced senescence and inflammatory response in a dose-dependent manner in cultured VSMCs. Histone treatment significantly promoted apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) as well as NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) interaction of inflammasomes in VSMCs. Forkhead box protein O4 (FOXO4), which is a downstream effector molecule of extracellular histones, was found to be involved in histone-regulated VSMC inflammatory response and senescence. Furthermore, the 5&amp;rsquo;-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway was confirmed to mediate extracellular histone-induced FOXO4 expression, and blocking this signaling pathway with an inhibitor can suppress vascular inflammation induced by extracellular histones &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Extracellular histones induce inflammation and senescence in VSMCs, and blocking the AMPK/FOXO4 pathway is a potential target for the treatment of histonemediated organ injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells-derived small extracellular vesicles (hucMSC-sEVs) have been demonstrated as a therapeutic agent to prevent and treat cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). However, hucMSC-sEVs still face many problems and challenges in the repair and treatment of tissue injury, including short circulation time, insufficient targeting, and low therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, we constructed engineered hybrid vesicles fused with nanovesicles derived from human neutrophil membranes and hucMSC-sEVs, named neutrophil membrane engineered hucMSC-sEVs (NEX). NEX significantly enhanced the targeting of hucMSC-sEVs to injured kidney tissues, improved the impaired renal function via reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, promoted the proliferation of renal tissue cells, and inhibited renal cell apoptosis in vivo. In addition, NEX enhanced hucMSC-sEVs uptake by NRK52E cells, but inhibited its uptake by RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, administration of NEX reduced cellular oxidative stress and promoted proliferation of NRK52E cells treated with cisplatin in vitro. In summary, our findings indicate that this design of a universal approach enhances the targeting and therapeutic efficacy of hucMSC-sEVs in kidney tissue regeneration, and provides new evidence promoting its clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of PP2A /NLRP3 signaling pathway in ambient particulate matter 2.5 induced lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35926746/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambient particulate matter 2.5 (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) exposure has been linked to pulmonary fibrosis. However, the key signaling pathways remained unclear. In the present study, we applied a mouse model with myeloid-specific deletion of Ppp2r1a gene (encoding protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) A subunit) to identify the key signaling pathways involved in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced pulmonary fibrosis. PP2A AÎ±-/- homozygote mice and matched wild-type (WT) littermates were exposed to filtered air (FA), unfiltered air (UA), and concentrated PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; (CA) in a real-ambient PM exposure system for 8 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively. The mice exposed to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; displayed a progressive inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, the expressions of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, caspase-1, ASC and IL-1Î² were increased in mice lung following PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, indicating PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure caused pulmonary inflammation by the NLRP3 pathways activation. Furthermore, the effects of PM exposure on pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, oxidative stress, and pulmonary function damage were significantly enhanced in PP2A-/- mice compared to WT mice, indicating the role of PP2A in the regulation of pulmonary injury induced by PM exposure. In vitro study confirmed that PP2A was involved in the PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-induced inflammation response and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Importantly, we identified PP2A regulated the activation of NLRP3 pathways by direct dephosphorylating IRE1Î± in response to PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PP2A-IRE1Î±-NLRP3 signaling pathway played a crucial role in regulating the inflammation response, triggering the lung fibrogenesis upon PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Our findings provide new insights into regulatory role of PP2A in human diseases upon the PM exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>YAP1 alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35979359/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a phospholipid peroxidation-mediated and iron-dependent cell death form, involved in sepsis-induced organ injury and other lung diseases. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a key regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, could target multiple ferroptosis regulators. Herein, this study aimed to explore the involvement of ferroptosis in the etiopathogenesis of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and demonstrate that YAP1 could disrupt ferritinophagy and moderate sepsis-induced ALI. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models were constructed in wild-type (WT) and pulmonary epithelium-conditional knockout (YAP1f/f) mice to induce ALI, while MLE-12 cells with or without YAP1 overexpression were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. In-vivo modes showed that YAP1 knockout aggravated CLP-induced ALI and also accelerated pulmonary ferroptosis, as presented by the downregulated expression of GPX4, FTH1, and SLC7A11, along with the upregulated expression of SFXN1 and NCOA4. Transcriptome research identified these key genes and ferroptosis pathways involved in sepsis-induced ALI. In-vitro modes consistently verified that YAP1 deficiency boosted the ferrous iron accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction in response to LPS. Furthermore, the co-IP assay revealed that YAP1 overexpression could prevent the degradation of ferritin to a mass of Fe2+ (ferritinophagy) via disrupting the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction, which blocked the transport of cytoplasmic Fe2+ into the mitochondria via the mitochondrial membrane protein (SFXN1), further reducing the generation of mitochondrial ROS. Therefore, these findings revealed that YAP1 could inhibit ferroptosis in a ferritinophagy-mediated manner, thus alleviating sepsis-induced ALI, which may provide a new approach to the therapeutic orientation for sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cellular communication network 2 (connective tissue growth factor) aggravates acute DNA damage and subsequent DNA damage response-senescence-fibrosis following kidney ischemia reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35921911/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic allograft dysfunction with progressive fibrosis of unknown cause remains a major issue after kidney transplantation, characterized by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). One hypothesis to account for this is that spontaneous progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis following IRI is driven by cellular senescence evolving from a prolonged, unresolved DNA damage response (DDR). Since cellular communication network factor 2 ((CCN2), formerly called connective tissue growth factor), an established mediator of kidney fibrosis, is also involved in senescence-associated pathways, we investigated the relation between CCN2 and cellular senescence following kidney transplantation. Tubular CCN2 overexpression was found to be associated with DDR, loss of kidney function and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in both the early and the late phase in human kidney allograft biopsies. Consistently, CCN2 deficient mice developed reduced senescence and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the late phase; six weeks after experimental IRI. Moreover, tubular DDR markers and plasma urea were less elevated in CCN2 knockout than in wild-type mice. Finally, CCN2 administration or overexpression in epithelial cells induced upregulation of tubular senescence-associated genes including p21, while silencing of CCN2 alleviated DDR induced by anoxia-reoxygenation injury in cultured proximal tubule epithelial cells. Thus, our observations indicate that inhibition of CCN2 can mitigate IRI-induced acute kidney injury, DNA damage, and the subsequent DDR-senescence-fibrosis sequence. Hence, targeting CCN2 might help to protect the kidney from transplantation-associated post-IRI chronic kidney dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fn14 exacerbates acute lung injury by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35907805/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Uncontrolled inflammation is an important factor in the occurrence and development of acute lung injury (ALI). Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), a plasma membrane-anchored receptor, takes part in the pathological process of a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. However, the role of Fn14 in ALI has not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate whether the activation of Fn14 exacerbated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In vivo, ALI was induced by intratracheal LPS-challenge combined with/without Fn14 receptor blocker aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) treatment in C57BL/6J mice. Following LPS administration, the survival rate, lung tissue injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, inflammatory factor secretion, oxidative stress, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation were assessed. In vitro, primary murine macrophages were used to evaluate the underlying mechanism by which Fn14 activated the NLRP3 inflammasome. Lentivirus was used to silence Fn14 to observe its effect on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In this study, we found that Fn14 expression was significantly increased in the lungs of LPS-induced ALI mice. The inhibition of Fn14 with ATA downregulated the protein expression of Fn14 in the lungs and improved the survival rate of mice receiving a lethal dose of LPS. ATA also attenuated lung tissue damage by decreasing the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, reducing inflammation, and suppressing oxidative stress. Importantly, we found that ATA strongly inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the lungs of ALI mice. Furthermore, in vitro, TWEAK, a natural ligand of Fn14, amplified the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the primary murine macrophage. By contrast, inhibition of Fn14 with shRNA decreased the expression of Fn14, NLRP3, Caspase-1 p10, and Caspase-1 p20, and the production of IL-1Î² and IL-18. Furthermore, the activation of Fn14 promoted the production of reactive oxygen species and inhibited the activation of Nrf2-HO-1 in activated macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study first reports that the activation of Fn14 aggravates ALI by amplifying the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, blocking Fn14 may be a potential way to treat ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PTPRO knockdown protects against inflammation in hemorrhage shock-induced lung injury involving the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35906634/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Hemorrhage shock (HS) is characterized by decreased tissue oxygenation and organ damage due to severe blood loss. Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) is abnormally up-regulated in the rat lungs after trauma/HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of PTPRO in lung inflammation following HS, we established a rat model of HS via withdrawing blood by a catheter inserted into the femoral artery followed by resuscitation. The rats were infected with lentivirus harboring short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting PTPRO by intratracheal instillation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; PTPRO was significantly up-regulated in rat lungs after HS. PTPRO knockdown enhanced epithelial integrity and reduced capillary leakage by up-regulating tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin (OCC) in the lungs. Besides, HS-induced myeloperoxidase activity and inflammatory cell infiltration was mitigated by PTPRO knockdown. The expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (TNF-Î±, IL-6, MIP-2, MCP-1, and KC) in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was regressed after PTPRO knockdown. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) pathway was involved in HS-induced lung inflammation. PTPRO down-regulation inhibited the NF-ÎºB pathway activation by suppressing the phosphorylation of NF-ÎºB and its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Taken together, we demonstrated that PTPRO knockdown may contribute to attenuating inflammation in HS-induced lung injury via inhibiting NF-ÎºB pathway activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of neutrophil extracellular traps in acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35967320/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a heterogeneous inflammatory condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. Neutrophils play a key role in the development of different forms of ALI, and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is emerging as a common pathogenic mechanism. NETs are essential in controlling pathogens, and their defective release or increased degradation leads to a higher risk of infection. However, NETs also contain several pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic molecules than can exacerbate thromboinflammation and lung tissue injury. To reduce NET-mediated lung damage and inflammation, DNase is frequently used in preclinical models of ALI due to its capability of digesting NET DNA scaffold. Moreover, recent advances in neutrophil biology led to the development of selective NET inhibitors, which also appear to reduce ALI in experimental models. Here we provide an overview of the role of NETs in different forms of ALI discussing existing gaps in our knowledge and novel therapeutic approaches to modulate their impact on lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LncRNA RMRP Contributes to the Development and Progression of Spinal Cord Injury by Regulating miR-766-5p/FAM83A Axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is known as a central nervous system disorder. Previous studies suggested that long-non-coding RNA RMRP (LncRNA RMRP) was abnormally expressed in SCI, but the potential underlying mechanism remains to be further explored. To explore the regulatory roles of LncRNA RMRP/miR-766-5p/FAM83A axis in SCI. Spinal T9 hemisection was performed on healthy adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats to establish the SCI rat models. The expressions of LncRNA RMRP in spinal cord of rats in different groups were examined by RT-qPCR. Moreover, AGE1.HN and PC12 cells were treated with hypoxic condition, and expression of LncRNA RMRP was examined by RT-qPCR methods. Furthermore, hypoxic PC12 cells were transfected with LncRNA RMRP OE, and the cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis were examined. Next, the direct targeting relationship between LncRNA RMRP and miR-766-5p, as well as miR-766-5p and FAM83A, was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. Finally, the effects of LncRNA RMRP/miR-766-5p/FAM83A axis on cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis were examined. LncRNA RMRP was downregulated in SCI rats and over-expression of LncRNA RMRP alleviated the SCI condition. LncRNA RMRP over-expression increased the viability and proliferation, and inhibited the apoptosis of hypoxic PC12 cells in vitro. miR-766-5p was confirmed as a target of LncRNA RMRP, and FAM83A was confirmed as a target of miR-766-5p. LncRNA RMRP could regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of hypoxic PC12 cells via regulating miR-766-5p/FAM83A axis in vitro. LncRNA RMRP may contribute to the pathogenesis of SCI via regulating miR-766-5p/FAM83A axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulated neutrophilic inflammation can be highly destructive in chronic inflammatory diseases due to prolonged neutrophil lifespan and continual release of histotoxic mediators in inflamed tissues. Therapeutic induction of neutrophil apoptosis, an immunologically silent form of cell death, may be beneficial in these diseases, provided that the apoptotic neutrophils are efficiently cleared from the tissue. Previous research in our group identified ErbB inhibitors as able to induce neutrophil apoptosis and reduce neutrophilic inflammation both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Here, we extend that work using a clinical ErbB inhibitor, neratinib, which has the potential to be repurposed in inflammatory diseases. We show that neratinib reduces neutrophilic migration o an inflammatory site in zebrafish larvae. Neratinib upregulates efferocytosis and reduces the number of persisting neutrophil corpses in mouse models of acute, but not chronic, lung injury, suggesting that the drug may have therapeutic benefits in acute inflammatory settings. Phosphoproteomic analysis of human neutrophils shows that neratinib modifies the phosphorylation of proteins regulating apoptosis, migration, and efferocytosis. This work identifies a potential mechanism for neratinib in treating acute lung inflammation by upregulating the clearance of dead neutrophils and, through examination of the neutrophil phosphoproteome, provides important insights into the mechanisms by which this may be occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is the most common complication associated with chest tumors, such as lung and breast cancers, after radiotherapy; however, the pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing has laid the foundation for studying RILI at the cellular microenvironmental level. This study focused on changes during the acute pneumonitis stage of RILI at the cellular microenvironmental level and investigated the interactions between different cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; An acute RILI model in mice and a single-cell transcriptional library were established. Intercellular communication networks were constructed to study the heterogeneity and intercellular interactions among different cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A single-cell transcriptome map was established in a mouse model of acute lung injury. In total, 18,500 single-cell transcripts were generated, and 10 major cell types were identified. The heterogeneity and radiosensitivity of each cell type or subtype in the lung tissues during the acute stage were revealed. It was found that immune cells had higher radiosensitivity than stromal cells. Immune cells were highly heterogeneous in terms of radiosensitivity, while some immune cells had the characteristics of radiation resistance. Two groups of radiation-induced Cd8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Mki67&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and Cd4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cxcr6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; helper T cells were identified. The presence of these cells was verified using immunofluorescence. The ligand-receptor interactions were analyzed by constructing intercellular communication networks. These explained the origins of the cells and revealed that they had been recruited from endothelial cells to the inflammatory site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study revealed the heterogeneity of &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; radiosensitivity of different cell types in the lung at the initial stage post irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anoikis is a programmed cell death occurring upon cell detachment from the correct extracellular matrix, thus disrupting integrin ligation. It is a critical mechanism in preventing dysplastic cell growth or attachment to an inappropriate matrix. Anoikis prevents detached epithelial cells from colonizing elsewhere and is thus essential for tissue homeostasis and development. As anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, two features associated with anoikis resistance, are crucial steps during tumour progression and metastatic spreading of cancer cells, anoikis deregulation has now evoked particular attention from the scientific community. The aim of this review is to analyse the molecular mechanisms governing both anoikis and anoikis resistance, focusing on their regulation in physiological processes, as well as in several diseases, including metastatic cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oral IRAK4 inhibitor BAY-1834845 prevents acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRAK4 inhibition is a potentially feasible treatment for ARDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BAY-1834845 shows unexpectedly discrepant efficacy in vivo with PF-06650833.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BAY-1834845 inhibits natural immunity signaling stronger than dexamethasone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lethal clinical entity that has become an emergency event with the outbreak of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no well-proven pharmacotherapies except dexamethasone. This study is aimed to evaluate IRAK4 inhibitors as a potential treatment for ARDS-cytokine release syndrome (CRS). We applied two IRAK4 inhibitors, BAY-1834845 and PF-06650833 to an inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS mouse model with control of high dose dexamethasone (10 mg/kg). Unexpectedly, although both compounds had excellent IC50 on IRAK4 kinase activity, only BAY-1834845 but not PF-06650833 or high dose dexamethasone could significantly prevent lung injury according to a blinded pathology scoring. Further, only BAY-1834845 and BAY-1834845 combined with dexamethasone could effectively improve the injury score of pre-existed ARDS. Compared with PF-06650833 and high dose dexamethasone, BAY-1834845 remarkably decreased inflammatory cells infiltrating lung tissue and neutrophil count in BALF. BAY-1834845, DEX, and the combination of the two agents could decrease BALF total T cells, monocyte, and macrophages. In further cell type enrichment analysis based on lung tissue RNA-seq, both BAY-1834845 and dexamethasone decreased signatures of inflammatory cells and effector lymphocytes. Interestingly, unlike the dexamethasone group, BAY-1834845 largely preserved the signatures of naÃ¯ve lymphocytes and stromal cells such as endothelial cells, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells. Differential gene enrichment suggested that BAY-1834845 downregulated genes more efficiently than dexamethasone, especially TNF, IL-17, interferon, and Toll-like receptor signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting ETosis by miR-155 inhibition mitigates mixed granulocytic asthmatic lung inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35958610/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthma is phenotypically heterogeneous with several distinctive pathological mechanistic pathways. Previous studies indicate that neutrophilic asthma has a poor response to standard asthma treatments comprising inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, it is important to identify critical factors that contribute to increased numbers of neutrophils in asthma patients whose symptoms are poorly controlled by conventional therapy. Leukocytes release chromatin fibers, referred to as extracellular traps (ETs) consisting of double-stranded (ds) DNA, histones, and granule contents. Excessive components of ETs contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma; however, it is unclear how ETs drive asthma phenotypes and whether they could be a potential therapeutic target. We employed a mouse model of severe asthma that recapitulates the intricate immune responses of neutrophilic and eosinophilic airway inflammation identified in patients with severe asthma. We used both a pharmacologic approach using miR-155 inhibitor-laden exosomes and genetic approaches using miR-155 knockout mice. Our data show that ETs are present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with mild asthma subjected to experimental subsegmental bronchoprovocation to an allergen and a severe asthma mouse model, which resembles the complex immune responses identified in severe human asthma. Furthermore, we show that miR-155 contributes to the extracellular release of dsDNA, which exacerbates allergic lung inflammation, and the inhibition of miR-155 results in therapeutic benefit in severe asthma mice. Our findings show that targeting dsDNA release represents an attractive therapeutic target for mitigating neutrophilic asthma phenotype, which is clinically refractory to standard care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress play critical roles in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colchicine (COL) mitigates severe acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury (SAP-ALI) in rats model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colchicine limits inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress in SAP-ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress contribute to the development of severe acute pancreatitis-associated acute lung injury (SAP-ALI). Currently, there is no curative treatment for SAP-ALI in the clinic. This study investigated the potential therapeutic role and mechanisms of colchicine in a rat model of SAP-ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized and administrated intragastrically with vehicle saline or colchicine (0.5 mg/kg/day) for seven days, followed by injecting sodium taurocholate to induce SAP-ALI. Together with a healthy control group of rats, their pancreatic and lung tissues and plasma samples were collected for histology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with the sham controls, the SAP group of rats with vehicle saline treatment displayed severe damages, inflammation with many neutrophil and macrophage infiltrates in pancreatic and lung tissues, accompanied by elevated levels of plasma interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, which were significantly mitigated in colchicine-treated SAP + COL group of rats. Furthermore, colchicine treatment significantly attenuated nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-ÎºB)-p65, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 4-Hydroxynonenal expression, ROS production and cell apoptosis by decreasing caspase-3 cleavage, Bax expression, but increasing Bcl-2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in pancreatic and lung tissues, relative to the SAP group of rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Colchicine treatment significantly mitigated the severity of SAP-ALI by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in rats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular dysfunction is a hallmark of chronic diseases in elderly. The contribution of the vasculature to lung repair and fibrosis is not fully understood. Here, we performed an epigenetic and transcriptional analysis of lung endothelial cells (ECs) from young and aged mice during the resolution or progression of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. We identified the transcription factor ETS-related gene (ERG) as putative orchestrator of lung capillary homeostasis and repair, and whose function is dysregulated in aging. ERG dysregulation is associated with reduced chromatin accessibility and maladaptive transcriptional responses to injury. Loss of endothelial ERG enhances paracrine fibroblast activation in vitro, and impairs lung fibrosis resolution in young mice in vivo. scRNA-seq of ERG deficient mouse lungs reveales transcriptional and fibrogenic abnormalities resembling those associated with aging and human lung fibrosis, including reduced number of general capillary (gCap) ECs. Our findings demonstrate that lung endothelial chromatin remodeling deteriorates with aging leading to abnormal transcription, vascular dysrepair, and persistent fibrosis following injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interferon-Î² regulates proresolving lipids to promote the resolution of acute airway inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberrant immune responses, including hyperresponsiveness to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, underlie acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Type I interferons confer antiviral activities and could also regulate the inflammatory response, whereas little is known about their actions to resolve aberrant inflammation. Here we report that interferon-Î² (IFN-Î²) exerts partially overlapping, but also cooperative actions with aspirin-triggered 15-epi-lipoxin A4 (15-epi-LXA4) and 17-epi-resolvin D1 to counter TLR9-generated cues to regulate neutrophil apoptosis and phagocytosis in human neutrophils. In mice, TLR9 activation impairs bacterial clearance, prolongs Escherichia coli-evoked lung injury, and suppresses production of IFN-Î² and the proresolving lipid mediators 15-epi-LXA4 and resolvin D1 (RvD1) in the lung. Neutralization of endogenous IFN-Î² delays pulmonary clearance of E. coli and aggravates mucosal injury. Conversely, treatment of mice with IFN-Î² accelerates clearance of bacteria, restores neutrophil phagocytosis, promotes neutrophil apoptosis and efferocytosis, and accelerates resolution of airway inflammation with concomitant increases in 15-epi-LXA4 and RvD1 production in the lungs. Pharmacological blockade of the lipoxin receptor ALX/FPR2 partially prevents IFN-Î²-mediated resolution. These findings point to a pivotal role of IFN-Î² in orchestrating timely resolution of neutrophil and TLR9 activation-driven airway inflammation and uncover an IFN-Î²-initiated resolution program, activation of an ALX/FPR2-centered, proresolving lipids-mediated circuit, for ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and its severe form Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are the major cause of ICU death worldwide. ALI/ARDS is characterized by severe hypoxemia and inflammation that leads to poor lung compliance. Despite many advances in understanding and management, ALI/ARDS is still causing significant morbidity and mortality. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a fast-growing topic in lung inflammation and injury. lncRNA is a class of non-coding RNA having a length of more than 200 nucleotides. It has been a center of research for understanding the pathophysiology of various diseases in the past few years. Multiple studies have shown that lncRNAs are abundant in acute lung injury/injuries in mouse models and cell lines. By targeting these long non-coding RNAs, many investigators have demonstrated the alleviation of ALI in various mouse models. Therefore, lncRNAs show great promise as a therapeutic target in ALI. This review provides the current state of knowledge about the relationship between lncRNAs in various biological processes in acute lung injury and its use as a potential therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation promotes alveolar epithelial recovery by activating Hippo/YAP signaling after lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35973885/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The preferred configuration for bridging patients with respiratory failure while awaiting lung transplantation is venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO). However, the protective effect of VV ECMO on the lung, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the role of VV ECMO in preventing lung injury in vivo using a rat model. Additionally, the effects of Hippo/YAP signaling on alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2)-mediated alveolar epithelial recovery in VV ECMO rats were also investigated. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, RNA sequencing, lung injury, edema, and cytokine expression were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; VV ECMO significantly improved severe hypoxemia, reduced lung edema, and inflammatory response, and altered alveolar epithelial function, as indicated by reduced protein concentrations in BALF. This was associated with Hippo/YAP signaling activation, according to RNA sequencing analysis. Furthermore, we discovered that after VV ECMO, AT2 cells proliferated and differentiated, and this increase in AT2 cell activity was correlated to the increased nuclear expression of YAP, which is critical for alveolar epithelial recovery from lung injury. During VV ECMO, verteporfin-induced YAP inhibition and the loss of the oxygenator delayed lung alveolar epithelial recovery and led to a prolonged inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings suggest that VV ECMO protects against lung injury by activating the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. Strategies aimed at increasing YAP activity in AT2 cells could thus aid alveolar epithelial recovery, making VV ECMO easier for lung transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the carboxypeptidase to degrade angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and improves the pathologies of cardiovascular disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/acute lung injury. B38-CAP is a bacteria-derived ACE2-like carboxypeptidase as potent as human ACE2 and ameliorates hypertension, heart failure and SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury in mice. Recombinant B38-CAP is prepared with E. coli protein expression system more efficiently than recombinant soluble human ACE2. Here we show therapeutic effects of B38-CAP on abdominal sepsis- or acid aspiration-induced acute lung injury. ACE2 expression was downregulated in the lungs of mice with cecal ligation puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis or acid-induced lung injury thereby leading to upregulation of Ang II levels. Intraperitoneal injection of B38-CAP significantly decreased Ang II levels while upregulated angiotensin 1-7 levels. B38-CAP improved survival rate of the mice under sepsis. B38-CAP suppressed the pathologies of lung inflammation, improved lung dysfunction and downregulated elevated cytokine mRNA levels in the mice with acute lung injury. Thus, systemic treatment with an ACE2-like enzyme might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the patients with severe sepsis or ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ACSL4 is essential for radiation-induced intestinal injury by initiating ferroptosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis is a newly recognized type of programmed cell death. With the method of RNA sequencing, we found that irradiation (IR) markedly increased the expression of ferroptosis promotive genes, whereas reduced the expression of ferroptosis suppressive genes in murine intestine tissues, when compared with those of liver and lung tissues. By using ferroptosis inducer RSL-3 and inhibitor liproxstatin-1, we found that ferroptosis is essential for IR-induced intestinal injury. Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) is an important component for ferroptosis execution, and we found that ACSL4 expression was significantly upregulated in irradiated intestine tissues, but not in liver or lung tissues. Antibacterial and antifungal regents reduced the expression of ASCL4 and protected against tissue injury in irradiated intestine tissues. Further studies showed that troglitazone, a ACSL4 inhibitor, succeeded to suppresses intestine lipid peroxidation and tissue damage after IR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Class IIa histone deacetylase inhibition ameliorates acute kidney injury by suppressing renal tubular cell apoptosis and enhancing autophagy and proliferation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35935816/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expression and function of histone deacetylases (HDACs) vary with cell types and pathological conditions. Our recent studies showed that pharmacological targeting class IIa HDACs attenuated renal fibrosis, but the effect of class IIa HDAC inhibition on acute kidney injury (AKI) remains unknown. In this study, we found that four class IIa HDACs (4, 5, 7, 9) were highly expressed in the kidney of folic acid (FA) and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced AKI in mice. Administration of TMP269, a potent and selective class IIa HDAC inhibitor, improved renal function and reduced tubular cell injury and apoptosis, with concomitant suppression of HDAC4 and elevation of acetyl-histone H3. Mechanistical studies showed that TMP269 treatment inhibited FA and I/R-induced caspase-3 cleavage, Bax expression and p53 phosphorylation. Conversely, TMP269 administration preserved expression of E-cadherin, BMP7, Klotho and Bcl-2 in injured kidneys. Moreover, TMP269 was effective in promoting cellular autophagy as indicated by increased expression of Atg7, beclin-1, and LC3II, and promoted renal tubular cell proliferation as shown by increased number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells and expression of cyclin E. Finally, blocking class IIa HDACs inhibited FA-and I/R-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, and p38, two signaling pathways associated with the pathogenesis of AKI. Collectively, these results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of class IIa HDACs protects against AKI through ameliorating apoptosis, enhancing autophagy and promoting proliferation of renal tubular cells by targeting multiple signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evaluation and Characterization of Post-Stroke Lung Damage in a Murine Model of Cerebral Ischemia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After stroke and other brain injuries, there is a high incidence of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute lung injury. The molecular mechanisms that drive the brain-lung interaction post-stroke have not yet been elucidated. We performed transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and sham surgery on C57BL/6J mice and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), serum, brain, and lung homogenate samples 24 h after surgery. A 92 proteins-panel developed by Olink ProteomicsÂ® was used to analyze the content in BALF and lung homogenates. MCAO animals had higher protein concentration levels in BALF than sham-controls, but these levels did not correlate with the infarct volume. No alteration in alveolar-capillary barrier permeability was observed. A total of 12 and 14 proteins were differentially expressed between the groups (FDR &amp;lt; 0.1) in BALF and lung tissue homogenates, respectively. Of those, HGF, TGF-Î±, and CCL2 were identified as the most relevant to this study. Their protein expression patterns were verified by ELISA. This study confirmed that post-stroke lung damage was not associated with increased lung permeability or cerebral ischemia severity. Furthermore, the dysregulation of HGF, TGF-Î±, and CCL2 in BALF and lung tissue after ischemia could play an important role in the molecular mechanisms underlying stroke-induced lung damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nano-silica particles synergistically IgE-mediated mast cell activation exacerbating allergic inflammation in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Allergic respiratory diseases have increased dramatically due to air pollution over the past few decades. However, studies are limited on the effects of inorganic components and particulate matter with different particle sizes in smog on allergic diseases, and the possible molecular mechanism of inducing allergies has not been thoroughly studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Four common mineral elements with different particle sizes in smog particles were selected, including Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We studied the relationship and molecular mechanism of smog particle composition, particle size, and allergic reactions using mast cells, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) model, and an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic mouse model in vitro and in vivo, combined with transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission X-ray microscopy analysis, and transcriptome sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Only 20 nm SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles significantly increased Î²-hexosaminidase release, based on dinitrophenol (DNP)-human serum albumin (HSA) stimulation, from IgE-sensitized mast cells, while other particles did not. Meanwhile, the PCA model showed that Evan&amp;rsquo;s blue extravasation in mice was increased after treatment with nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles. Nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles exposure in the asthmatic mouse model caused an enhancement of allergic airway inflammation as manifested by OVA-specific serum IgE, airway hyperresponsiveness, lung inflammation injury, mucous cell metaplasia, cytokine expression, mast cell activation, and histamine secretion, which were significantly increased. Nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles exposure did not affect the expression of FcÏµRI or the ability of mast cells to bind IgE but synergistically activated mast cells by enhancing the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, especially the phosphorylation levels of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. The ERK inhibitors showed a significant inhibitory effect in reducing Î²-hexosaminidase release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our results indicated that nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles stimulation might synergistically activate IgE-sensitized mast cells by enhancing the MAPK signaling pathway and that nano-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles exposure could exacerbate allergic inflammation. Our experimental results provide useful information for preventing and treating allergic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PTP1B inhibitors protect against acute lung injury and regulate CXCR4 signaling in neutrophils</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35866483/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a lethal condition with limited treatment options and currently a common global cause of death due to COVID-19. ARDS secondary to transfusion-related ALI (TRALI) has been recapitulated preclinically by anti-MHC-I antibody administration to LPS-primed mice. In this model, we demonstrate that inhibitors of PTP1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates signaling pathways of fundamental importance to homeostasis and inflammation, prevented lung injury and increased survival. Treatment with PTP1B inhibitors attenuated the aberrant neutrophil function that drives ALI and was associated with release of myeloperoxidase, suppression of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and inhibition of neutrophil migration. Mechanistically, reduced signaling through the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, particularly to the activation of PI3KÎ³/AKT/mTOR, was essential for these effects, linking PTP1B inhibition to promoting an aged-neutrophil phenotype. Considering that dysregulated activation of neutrophils has been implicated in sepsis and causes collateral tissue damage, we demonstrate that PTP1B inhibitors improved survival and ameliorated lung injury in an LPS-induced sepsis model and improved survival in the cecal ligation and puncture-induced (CLP-induced) sepsis model. Our data highlight the potential for PTP1B inhibition to prevent ALI and ARDS from multiple etiologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mucin 1 Inhibits Ferroptosis and Sensitizes Vitamin E to Alleviate Sepsis-Induced Acute Lung Injury through GSK3 Î²/Keap1-Nrf2-GPX4 Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35910848/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic form of programmed cell death, which may be related to the occurrence and development of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/acute lung injury (ALI). Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a kind of macromolecule transmembrane glycoprotein. Previous studies have shown that MUC1 could relieve ALI in sepsis and predict whether sepsis patients would develop into ARDS. However, the role of MUC1 in the ferroptosis of sepsis-induced ALI/ARDS remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Sera samples from 50 patients with sepsis/septic shock were used to detect iron metabolism-related markers. Western blot and qRT-PCR were conducted to detect the expression levels of ferroptosis-related genes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to evaluate inflammatory factors. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to assess morphological changes of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The results showed that the iron metabolism-related indicators in sepsis-induced ARDS patients changed significantly, suggesting the iron metabolism disorder. The expression levels of ferroptosis-related genes in lung tissues of sepsis had marked changes, and the lipid peroxidation levels increased, while Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) could reverse the above results, which confirmed the occurrence of ferroptosis. In terms of mechanism studies, inhibition of MUC1 dimerization could increase the expression level of Keap1, reduce the phosphorylation level of GSK3Î², inhibit the entry of Nrf2 into the nucleus, further inhibit the expression level of GPX4, enhance the lipid peroxidation level of lung tissues, trigger ferroptosis, and aggravate lung injury. Besides, inhibiting MUC1 reversed the alleviating effect of vitamin E on ALI caused by sepsis, increased the aggregation of inflammatory cells in lung tissues, and aggravated alveolar injury and edema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study was the first to explore the changes of iron metabolism indicators in ALI/ARDS of sepsis, clarify the important role of ferroptosis in ALI/ARDS induced by sepsis, and reveal the effects and specific mechanisms of MUC1 in regulating ferroptosis, as well as the sensitization on vitamin E.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel gold-platinum nanoparticles serve as broad-spectrum antioxidants for attenuating ischemia reperfusion injury of the kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35870640/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidney ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a common and inevitable pathological condition in routine urological practices, especially during transplantation. Severe kidney IRI may even induce systemic damage to peripheral organs, and lead to multisystem organ failure. However, no standard clinical treatment option is currently available. It has been reported that kidney IRI is predominantly associated with abnormally increased endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS). Scavenging excessive ROS may reduce the damage caused by oxidative stress and subsequently alleviate kidney IRI. Here, we reported a simple and efficient one-step synthesis of gold-platinum nanoparticles (AuPt NPs) with a gold core having a loose and branched outer platinum shell with superior ROS scavenging capacity to possibly treat kidney IRI. These AuPt NPs exhibited multiple enzyme-like anti-oxidative properties simultaneously possessing catalase- and peroxidase-like activity. These particles showed excellent cell protective capability, and alleviated kidney IRI both in vitro and in vivo without obvious toxicity, by suppressing cell apoptosis, inflammatory cytokine release, and inflammasome formation. Meanwhile, AuPt NPs also had an effect on inhibiting the transition to chronic kidney disease by reducing kidney fibrosis in the long term. Thus, AuPt NPs might be a good therapeutic agent for kidney IRI management and may be helpful for the development of clinical treatments for kidney IRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PLCÎ²2 Promotes VEGF-Induced Vascular Permeability</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35861069/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Regulation of vascular permeability is critical to maintaining tissue metabolic homeostasis. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) is a key stimulus of vascular permeability in acute and chronic diseases including ischemia reperfusion injury, sepsis, and cancer. Identification of novel regulators of vascular permeability would allow for the development of effective targeted therapeutics for patients with unmet medical need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In vitro and in vivo models of VEGFA-induced vascular permeability, pathological permeability, quantitation of intracellular calcium release and cell entry, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels were evaluated with and without modulation of PLC (phospholipase C) Î²2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Global knock-out of &lt;em&gt;PLCÎ²2&lt;/em&gt; in mice resulted in blockade of VEGFA-induced vascular permeability in vivo and transendothelial permeability in primary lung endothelial cells. Further work in an immortalized human microvascular cell line modulated with stable knockdown of PLCÎ²2 recapitulated the observations in the mouse model and primary cell assays. Additionally, loss of PLCÎ²2 limited both intracellular release and extracellular entry of calcium following VEGF stimulation as well as reduced basal and VEGFA-stimulated levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate compared to control cells. Finally, loss of PLCÎ²2 in both a hyperoxia-induced lung permeability model and a cardiac ischemia:reperfusion model resulted in improved animal outcomes when compared with wild-type controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The results implicate PLCÎ²2 as a key positive regulator of VEGF-induced vascular permeability through regulation of both calcium flux and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels at the cellular level. Targeting of PLCÎ²2 in a therapeutic setting may provide a novel approach to regulating vascular permeability in patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salvianolic acid A (SAA) is one of bioactive polyphenol extracted from a Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), which was widely used to treat cardiovascular disease in traditional Chinese medicine. SAA has been reported to be protective in cardiovascular disease and ischemia injury, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effect, but its role in acute lung injury (ALI) is still unknown. In this study, we sought to investigate the therapeutic effects of SAA in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ALI. The optimal dose of SAA was determined by comparing the attenuation of lung injury score after administration of SAA at three different doses (low, 5 mg/kg; medium, 10 mg/kg; and, high 15 mg/kg). Dexamethasone (DEX) was used as a positive control for SAA. Here, we showed that the therapeutic effect of SAA (10 mg/kg) against LPS-induced pathologic injury in the lungs was comparable to DEX. SAA and DEX attenuated the increased W/D ratio and the protein level, counts of total cells and neutrophils, and cytokine levels in the BALF of ALI mice similarly. The oxidative stress was also relieved by SAA and DEX according to the superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde. NET level in the lungs was elevated in the injured lung while SAA and DEX reduced it significantly. LPS induced phosphorylation of Src, Raf, MEK, and ERK in the lungs, which was inhibited by SAA and DEX. NET level and phosphorylation level of Src/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in the neutrophils from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients were also inhibited by SAA and DEX in vitro, but the YEEI peptide reversed the protective effect of SAA completely. The inhibition of NET release by SAA was also reversed by YEEI peptide in LPS-challenged neutrophils from healthy volunteers. Our data demonstrated that SAA ameliorated ALI via attenuating inflammation, oxidative stress, and neutrophil NETosis. The mechanism of such protective effect might involve the inhibition of Src activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COVID-19 lung disease shares driver AT2 cytopathic features with Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35870428/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In the aftermath of Covid-19, some patients develop a fibrotic lung disease, i.e., post-COVID-19 lung disease (PCLD), for which we currently lack insights into pathogenesis, disease models, or treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Using an AI-guided approach, we analyzed &amp;gt; 1000 human lung transcriptomic datasets associated with various lung conditions using two viral pandemic signatures (ViP and sViP) and one covid lung-derived signature. Upon identifying similarities between COVID-19 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), we subsequently dissected the basis for such similarity from molecular, cytopathic, and immunologic perspectives using a panel of IPF-specific gene signatures, alongside signatures of alveolar type II (AT2) cytopathies and of prognostic monocyte-driven processes that are known drivers of IPF. Transcriptome-derived findings were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to identify the major triggers of AT2 dysfunction. Key findings were validated in hamster and human adult lung organoid (ALO) pre-clinical models of COVID-19 using immunohistochemistry and qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Findings:&lt;/em&gt; COVID-19 resembles IPF at a fundamental level; it recapitulates the gene expression patterns (ViP and IPF signatures), cytokine storm (IL15-centric), and the AT2 cytopathic changes, e.g., injury, DNA damage, arrest in a transient, damage-induced progenitor state, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These immunocytopathic features were induced in pre-clinical COVID models (ALO and hamster) and reversed with effective anti-CoV-2 therapeutics in hamsters. PPI-network analyses pinpointed ER stress as one of the shared early triggers of both diseases, and IHC studies validated the same in the lungs of deceased subjects with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamster lungs. Lungs from tg-mice, in which ER stress is induced specifically in the AT2 cells, faithfully recapitulate the host immune response and alveolar cytopathic changes that are induced by SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/em&gt; Like IPF, COVID-19 may be driven by injury-induced ER stress that culminates into progenitor state arrest and SASP in AT2 cells. The ViP signatures in monocytes may be key determinants of prognosis. The insights, signatures, disease models identified here are likely to spur the development of therapies for patients with IPF and other fibrotic interstitial lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhaled Pro-Efferocytic Nanozymes Promote Resolution of Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35859230/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a significant contributor to the morbidity and mortality of sepsis. Characterized by uncontrolled inflammation and excessive inflammatory cells infiltration in lung, ALI has been exacerbated by impaired efferocytosis (clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages). Through specific receptor recognition and activation of downstream signaling, efferocytic macrophages promote resolution of inflammation by efficiently engulfing dying cells, avoiding the consequent release of cellular inflammatory contents. Here, inspired by the intrinsic recovery mechanism of efferocytosis, an apoptotic cell membrane (ACM) coated antioxidant nanozyme (AOzyme) is engineered, thus obtaining an inhalable pro-efferocytic nanozyme (AOzyme@ACM). Notably, AOzyme@ACM can efficiently increase apoptotic cell removal by combing enhanced macrophages recognition of &amp;ldquo;eat me&amp;rdquo; signals through apoptotic body mimicking and scavenge of intracellular excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), a significant barrier for efferocytosis. AOzyme@ACM can significantly inhibit inflammatory response, promote pro-resolving (M2) phenotype transition of macrophage, and alleviate ALI in endotoxemia mice compared with AOzyme group. By addressing the critical factor in the pathogenesis of sepsis-related ALI through restoring efferocytosis activity, the ACM-based antioxidant nanozyme in this study is envisioned to provide a promising strategy to treat this complex and challenging disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interleukin-6-dependent epithelial fluidization initiates fibrotic lung remodeling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35857823/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic disease results from the failure of tissues to maintain homeostasis. In the lung, coordinated repair of the epithelium is essential for preserving homeostasis. In animal models and human lung disease, airway epithelial cells mobilize in response to lung injury, resulting in the formation of airway-like cysts with persistent loss of functional cell types and parenchymal architecture. Using live-cell imaging of human lung epithelial cultures and mouse precision-cut lung slices, we demonstrated that distal airway epithelia are aberrantly fluidized both after injury and in fibrotic lung disease. Through transcriptomic profiling and pharmacologic stimulation of epithelial cultures, we identified interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling as a driver of tissue fluidization. This signaling cascade occurred independently of canonical Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling but instead was dependent on a downstream SRC family kinase (SFK)-yes-associated protein (YAP) axis. Airway epithelial-fibroblast cocultures revealed that the fibrotic mesenchyme acts as a source of IL-6 family cytokines, which drive airway fluidization. Inhibition of the IL-6-SFK-YAP cascade was sufficient to prevent fluidization in both in vitro and ex vivo models. Last, we demonstrated a reduction in fibrotic lung remodeling in mice through genetic or pharmacologic targeting of IL-6-related signaling. Together, our findings illustrate the critical role of airway epithelial fluidization in coordinating the balance between homeostatic lung repair and fibrotic airspace remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anti-inflammatory protective effect of ADAMTS-13 in murine arthritis models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35875933/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have frequent thrombotic events with endothelial dysfunction. Von Willebrand factor (VWF) has been shown to bind neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and NETs are part of RA etiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; This study aims to elucidate whether this prothrombotic status exacerbates inflammation in arthritis. Here we focus on the involvement of A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13), an enzyme cleaving VWF and its effect on NET deposition and RA development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We evaluated the influence of the Adamts13 gene and recombinant human ADAMTS-13 (rhADAMTS-13) on arthritis in the mouse models of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We also assessed VWF and NETs in synovial tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Several &lt;em&gt;Adamts13&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice developed arthritis, while &lt;em&gt;Adamts13&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; siblings did not. Synovial tissue from &lt;em&gt;Adamts13&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; showed accumulation of NETs. Treatment of DBA/1 J mice, an arthritis-susceptible strain, with well-tolerated doses of rhADAMT13 reduced arthritis incidence and alleviated the severity of arthritis. Mice treated with rhADAMT13 presented less serum interleukin 6 and less bone erosion determined by micro-computed tomography. The effects on arthritis severity were observed both when administering rhADAMTS-13 prophylactically and also when given after arthritis has developed. In both conditions, rhADAMTS-13 reduced VWF and NET deposition on proliferated synovial tissue evaluated by immunoblotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results demonstrate the inhibitory role of &lt;em&gt;Adamts13&lt;/em&gt; in murine arthritis and the effectiveness of rhADAMTS-13 treatment. Additionally, this study suggests that deposition of VWF in the synovium and subsequent pathogenic NET retention promotes arthritis. Treatment with rhADAMTS-13 provides a potential therapeutic approach targeting inflammation and pro-thrombotic state in arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating extracellular histones exacerbate acute lung injury by augmenting pulmonary endothelial dysfunction via TLR4-dependent mechanism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35852995/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular histones released into the circulation following trauma, sepsis, and ARDS may act as potent damage-associated molecular pattern signals leading to multiple organ failure. Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction caused by extracellular histones has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo; however, precise mechanistic details of histone-induced EC dysfunction and exacerbation of ongoing inflammation remain poorly understood. This study investigated the role of extracellular histones in exacerbating preexisting endothelial dysfunction and acute lung injury. Histone subunits H3 and H4, but not H1, H2A, or H2B, induced permeability in human pulmonary EC. H3 and H4 at concentrations above 30 Âµg/mL caused EC inflammation reflected by activation of the NF-ÎºB pathway, transcriptional activation, and release of cytokines and chemokines including IL-6 and IL-8, and increased mRNA and protein expression of EC adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Pharmacological inhibitors targeting Toll-like receptor TLR4 but not TLR2/6, blocked histone-induced EC dysfunction. H3 and H4 also strongly augmented EC permeability and inflammation caused by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial particles, endotoxin, and TNFÎ±. Heparin blocked histone-induced augmentation of EC inflammation caused by endotoxin and TNFÎ±. Injection of histone in mouse models of lung injury caused by bacterial wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (HKSA) augmented ALI parameters: increased protein content, cell count, and inflammatory cytokine secretion in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Important clinical significance of these findings is in the demonstration that even a modest increase in extracellular histone levels can act as a severe exacerbating factor in conjunction with other EC barrier disruptive or proinflammatory agents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MgIG exerts therapeutic effects on crizotinib-induced hepatotoxicity by limiting ROS-mediated autophagy and pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35855570/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crizotinib (CRIZO) has been widely employed to treat non-small-cell lung cancer. However, hepatic inflammatory injury is the major toxicity of CRIZO, which limits its clinical application, and the underlying mechanism of CRIZO-induced hepatotoxicity has not been fully explored. Herein, we used cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry to detect CRIZO-induced cytotoxicity on human hepatocytes (HL-7702). CRIZO significantly reduced the survival rate of hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay kit showed that CRIZO treatment strongly increased the level of ROS. In addition, CRIZO treatment caused the appearance of balloon-like bubbles and autophagosomes in HL-7702 cells. Subsequently, Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA assays revealed that ROS-mediated pyroptosis and autophagy contributed to CRIZO-induced hepatic injury. Based on the role of ROS in CRIZO-induced hepatotoxicity, magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) was used as an intervention drug. MgIG activated the Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway and reduced ROS level. Additionally, MgIG suppressed hepatic inflammation by inhibiting NF-ÎºB activity, thereby reducing CRIZO-induced hepatotoxicity. In conclusion, CRIZO promoted autophagy activation and pyroptosis via the accumulation of ROS in HL-7702 cells. MgIG exerts therapeutic effects on CRIZO-induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing the level of ROS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ZNF354C Mediated by DNMT1 Ameliorates Lung Ischemia-Reperfusion Oxidative Stress Injury by Reducing TFPI Promoter Methylation to Upregulate TFPI</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35915612/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Pulmonary ischemia reperfusion- (I/R-) induced dysfunction is a significant clinical problem after lung transplantation. In this study, we aim to explore the molecular mechanism of lung I/R injury (LIRI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Bioinformatic analysis of gene involved in oxidative stress. A HUVEC oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model and I/R mouse model were first established via I/R. The cellular proliferation, migration, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and parameters of lung injury were assessed via CCK-8, EdU staining, Transwell, cellular ROS kit, and H&amp;amp;E staining. We also confirmed related gene expressions and protein levels and the interaction between the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) promotor and ZNF354C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Bioinformatic analysis results showed TFPI contributed to oxidative stress. OGD/R caused a reduction in cell viability and migration, hypermethylation of TFPI, increased ROS, and downregulation of ZNF354C, TFPI, and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in HUVECs. Besides, ZNF354C could directly bind to the TFPI promoter, enhance proliferation and migration, and inhibit ROS in OGD/R-induced HUVECs by upregulating TFPI. More importantly, we discovered that 5-Aza could reduce TFPI methylation, upregulate TFPI, and enhance the binding of ZNF354C to the TFPI promoter in LIRI. Furthermore, DNMT1 silencing could induce proliferation and migration and prevent ROS in OGD/R-induced HUVECs by upregulating ZNF354C. Additionally, we verified that ZNF354C could alleviate LIRI by preventing DNA methylation &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; ZNF354C overexpression induced proliferation and migration, as well as suppressed ROS in OGD/R-induced HUVECs, and alleviated LIRI in mice by inhibiting TFPI promoter methylation to upregulate TFPI. Therefore, ZNF354C and TFPI methylation might be promising molecular markers for LIRI therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20(&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;)-25-methoxyl-dammarane-3Î²,12Î²,20-triol (25-OCH3-PPD, AD-1) is a dammarane ginsenoside that is isolated from Panax notoginseng. The present study aimed to explore its anti-pulmonary fibrosis (PF) effect &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. L929 cells were treated with 10 Î¼g mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish a PF model &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and mice were administered with 3.5 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; bleomycin (BLM) by endotracheal intubation to establish a PF model &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; for investigating the anti-PF effect and its potential mechanism. The results demonstrated that AD-1 reduced the injury, extracellular matrix (ECM) buildup and Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA) protein expression levels of L929 induced by LPS. Oral administration of AD-1 downregulated the expression of interleukins (such as IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-18), increased the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH), reduced the lung coefficient and the content of hydroxyproline (HYP), and mediated the Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio and P-p53, Î²-catenin and SIRT3 expression in the lung tissue of mice. Furthermore, AD-1 inhibited the expression levels of TGF-Î²1, TIMP-1 and Î±-SMA and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition in the lung tissue of PF mice. These results indicated that AD-1 could alleviate PF both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, and the underlying mechanism may be related to the decrease in ECM deposition and inflammation, the enhancement of antioxidant capacity, and the mediation of lung cell apoptosis and the TGF-Î²1/TIMP-1/Î±-SMA signaling pathway, which provide a theoretical basis for the rehabilitation treatment of PF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cobalt ions induced more serious damage in the reoxygenation stage in HRI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induced GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in the HRI-AKI model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-activated GSDME was cleaved via the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in HRI-AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-elevated autophagy promoted the induction of apoptosis and GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in HRI-AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt is a transition element that abundantly exists in the environment. Besides direct hypoxia stress, cobalt ions indirectly induce hypoxia-reoxygenation injury (HRI), the main cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), a life-threatening clinical syndrome characterized by the necrosis of the proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) and inflammation. Pyroptosis, a type of inflammatory programmed cell death, might play an essential role in HRI-AKI. However, whether pyroptosis is involved in cobalt chloride (CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-induced HRI-AKI remains unknown. Autophagy is a cellular biological process maintaining cell homeostasis that is involved in cell damage in AKI, yet the underlying regulatory mechanism of autophagy on pyroptosis has not been fully understood. In this study, the in vitro and in vivo models of CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced HRI-AKI were established with HK-2 cell line and C57BL/6J mouse. Pyroptosis-related markers were detected with western blotting and immunofluorescence assays, and results showed that gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis was involved in the cell damage in HRI-AKI. Specific chemical inhibitors of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 significantly inhibited GSDME-mediated pyroptosis, verifying that GSDME-mediated pyroptosis was induced via the activation of caspase 3/8/9. The western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were adopted to detect the accumulation of the autophagosomes, and results suggested that HRI increased the autophagic level. The effects of autophagy on apoptosis and pyroptosis were evaluated using lentivirus transfection assays to knock down autophagy-specific genes atg5 and fip200, and results demonstrated that autophagy induced GSDME-mediated pyroptosis via apoptotic pathways in HRI-AKI. Our results revealed the involvement of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced HRI-AKI and promoted the understanding of the regulatory mechanism of GSDME cleavage. Our study might provide a potential therapeutic target for HRI-AKI, and will be helpful for the risk evaluation of cobalt exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ceria nanoparticles prophylactic used for renal ischemia-reperfusion injury treatment by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammatory response</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35926357/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury (RIRI) is the leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), a common disease with high morbidity and mortality. However, due to the lack of effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools, patients have to resort to conservative treatment. To address this issue, we have developed a novel prophylactic strategy that involves the pre-treatment use of ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) before surgery. Based on our careful study of the three different sizes of CNPs that we synthesized, 46 nm (NP46), 81 nm (NP81), and 118 nm (NP118), we have found that NP118 can be used as effective prophylactic agents against RIRI and subsequent renal fibrosis. In our experiments, the CNPs exhibited excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro and effectively protected the kidney against RIRI and renal fibrosis in vivo, as proved by the decreases in renal lesions, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, apoptotic cell, KIM-1 expression, and fibrotic area in CNPs treated samples relative to RIRI group. Mechanistically, not only did the CNPs reduce oxidative stress by regulating the Nrf2 pathway, but they also attenuated RIRI induced inflammatory response by decreasing macrophage infiltration and polarization to M1 phenotype, and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. In vitro results further confirmed that CNPs pre-treatment not only dramatically decreased intracellular ROS production in renal tubular epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells, but also effectively attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells. In addition, we found that one fourth of the NP118 persisted for more than 21 days in IR kidneys, and that out of the three sizes of CNPs, NP118 achieved the best results in all our experiments. Our study provides new insights into the usage and majorization of CNPs as a potential therapy to treat or prevent RIRI and renal fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging roles of extracellular vesicle-associated non-coding RNAs in hypoxia: Insights from cancer, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35966580/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia is a central pathophysiological component in cancer, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, which represent the most common medical conditions resulting in long-term disability and death. Recent evidence suggests common signaling pathways in these diverse settings mediated by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are packaged in extracellular vesicles (EVs) protecting ncRNAs from degradation. EVs are a heterogeneous group of lipid bilayer-covered vesicles released from virtually all cells, which have important roles in intercellular communication. Recent studies pointed out that ncRNAs including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are selectively sorted into EVs, modulating specific aspects of cancer development, namely cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, immune tolerance or drug resistance, under conditions of hypoxia in recipient cells. In myocardial infarction and stroke, ncRNAs shuttled via EVs have been shown to control tissue survival and remodeling post-hypoxia by regulating cell injury, inflammatory responses, angiogenesis, neurogenesis or neuronal plasticity. This review discusses recent evidence on EV-associated ncRNAs in hypoxic cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke, discussing their cellular origin, biological function and disease significance. The emerging concept of lncRNA-circular RNA/ miRNA/ mRNA networks is outlined, upon which ncRNAs synergistically respond to hypoxia in order to modify disease responses. Particular notion is given to ncRNAs participating in at least two of the three conditions, which revealed a large degree of overlaps across pathophysiological conditions. Possible roles of EV-ncRNAs as therapeutic products or theranostic markers are defined.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of Immuno-Inflammatory Signals in Liver Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35883665/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major obstacle in liver resection and liver transplantation. The initial step of IRI is mediated through ischemia which promotes the production of reactive oxygen species in Kupffer cells. This furthermore promotes the activation of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, interferon, inducible nitric oxide synthase, TLR9/nuclear-factor kappa B pathway, and the production of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as ATP, histone, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), urate, mitochondrial formyl peptides and S100 proteins. With ongoing cell death of hepatocytes during the ischemic phase, DAMPs are built up and released into the circulation upon reperfusion. This promotes a cytokines/chemokine storm that attracts neutrophils and other immune cells to the site of tissue injury. The effect of IRI is further aggravated by the release of cytokines and chemokines, such as epithelial neutrophil activating protein (CXCL5), KC (CXCL1) and MIP-2 (CXCL2), the complement proteins C3a and C5a, mitochondrial-derived formyl peptides, leukotriene B4 and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) from migrating neutrophils. These NETs can also activate platelets and form Neutrophil-platelet microthrombi to further worsen ischemia in the liver. In this review we aim to summarize the current knowledge of mediators that promote liver IRI, and we will discuss the role of neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps in mediating IRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CXCR2 Is Essential for Radiation-Induced Intestinal Injury by Initiating Neutrophil Infiltration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35879949/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils, known as an important part of the immune system, are the most abundant leukocyte population in peripheral blood, but excessive recruitment will lead to tissue/organ injury. RNA sequencing showed that ionizing radiation significantly increased the expression of characteristic genes of neutrophils in intestinal tissues compared with liver and lung tissues. By clearing neutrophils with an anti-Ly6G antibody, we found that neutrophil infiltration is critical for irradiation-induced intestinal injury. CXCR2 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that mediates the migration of neutrophils by combining with its ligands. Compared with observations in liver and lung tissues, we found that CXCR2 and its ligands, including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL5, were all significantly upregulated in irradiated intestinal tissues. Further studies showed that SB225002, an inhibitor of CXCR2, could effectively inhibit the chemotaxis of neutrophils and tissue damage mediated by the CXCL-CXCR2 signalling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plk2-mediated phosphorylation and translocalization of Nrf2 activates anti-inflammation through p53/Plk2/p21cip1 signaling in acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35842499/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plk2 is a cellular stress-responsive factor that is induced in response to oxidative stress. However, the roles of Plk2 in acute kidney injury (AKI) have not been clarified. We previously found that Plk2 is an interacting factor of Nrf2 in response to cellular stress, since Plk2 is upregulated in the Nrf2-dependent network. Here, we show that the levels of p53, Plk2, p21&lt;sup&gt;cip1&lt;/sup&gt;, and chromatin-bound Nrf2 were all upregulated in kidney tissues of mice or NRK52E cells treated with either cisplatin or methotrexate. Upregulation of Plk2 by p53 led to an increase of Nrf2 in both soluble and chromatin fractions in cisplatin-treated NRK52E cells. Consistently, depletion of Plk2 suppressed the levels of Nrf2. Of note, Plk2 directly phosphorylated Nrf2 at Ser40, which facilitated its interaction with p21&lt;sup&gt;cip1&lt;/sup&gt; and translocation into the nuclei for the activation of anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory factors in response to AKI. Together, these findings suggest that Plk2 may serve as an anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory regulator through the phosphorylation and activation of Nrf2 to protect kidney cells from kidney toxicants and that Plk2 and Nrf2 therefore work cooperatively for the protection and survival of kidney cells from harmful stresses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wildfires and extracellular vesicles: Exosomal MicroRNAs as mediators of cross-tissue cardiopulmonary responses to biomass smoke</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35863239/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35863239/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple wildfire-relevant exposure conditions were tested in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were evaluated in circulating plasma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposures altered EV-encapsulated microRNAs involved in cell stress and hypoxia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposures disrupted cell stress and hypoxia pathways in lung and heart tissues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced responses occurred from flaming vs. smoldering burn conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Wildfires are a threat to public health world-wide that are growing in intensity and prevalence. The biological mechanisms that elicit wildfire-associated toxicity remain largely unknown. The potential involvement of cross-tissue communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a new mechanism that has yet to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Female CD-1 mice were exposed to smoke condensate samples collected from the following biomass burn scenarios: flaming peat; smoldering peat; flaming red oak; and smoldering red oak, representing lab-based simulations of wildfire scenarios. Lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples, peripheral blood, and heart tissues were collected 4 and 24 h post-exposure. Exosome-enriched EVs were isolated from plasma, physically characterized, and profiled for microRNA (miRNA) expression. Pathway-level responses in the lung and heart were evaluated through RNA sequencing and pathway analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Markers of cardiopulmonary tissue injury and inflammation from BALF samples were significantly altered in response to exposures, with the greatest changes occurring from flaming biomass conditions. Plasma EV miRNAs relevant to cardiovascular disease showed exposure-induced expression alterations, including miR-150, miR-183, miR-223-3p, miR-30b, and miR-378a. Lung and heart mRNAs were identified with differential expression enriched for hypoxia and cell stress-related pathways. Flaming red oak exposure induced the greatest transcriptional response in the heart, a large portion of which were predicted as regulated by plasma EV miRNAs, including miRNAs known to regulate hypoxia-induced cardiovascular injury. Many of these miRNAs had published evidence supporting their transfer across tissues. A follow-up analysis of miR-30b showed that it was increased in expression in the heart of exposed mice in the absence of changes to its precursor molecular, pri-miR-30b, suggesting potential transfer from external sources (e.g., plasma).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt; This study posits a potential mechanism through which wildfire exposures induce cardiopulmonary responses, highlighting the role of circulating plasma EVs in intercellular and systems-level communication between tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>14-3-3Î¶ inhibits maladaptive repair in renal tubules by regulating YAP and reduces renal interstitial fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35840657/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) refers to a group of common clinical syndromes characterized by acute renal dysfunction, which may lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), and this process is called the AKI-CKD transition. The transcriptional coactivator YAP can promote the AKI-CKD transition by regulating the expression of profibrotic factors, and 14-3-3 protein zeta (14-3-3Î¶), an important regulatory protein of YAP, may prevent the AKI-CKD transition. We established an AKI-CKD model in mice by unilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and overexpressed 14-3-3Î¶ in mice using a fluid dynamics-based gene transfection technique. We also overexpressed and knocked down 14-3-3Î¶ in vitro. In AKI-CKD model mice, 14-3-3Î¶ expression was significantly increased at the AKI stage. During the development of chronic disease, the expression of 14-3-3Î¶ tended to decrease, whereas active YAP was consistently overexpressed. In vitro, we found that 14-3-3Î¶ can combine with YAP, promote the phosphorylation of YAP, inhibit YAP nuclear translocation, and reduce the expression of fibrosis-related proteins. In an in vivo intervention experiment, we found that the overexpression of 14-3-3Î¶ slowed the process of renal fibrosis in a mouse model of AKI-CKD. These findings suggest that 14-3-3Î¶ can affect the expression of fibrosis-related proteins by regulating YAP, inhibit the maladaptive repair of renal tubular epithelial cells, and prevent the AKI-CKD transition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomal lncRNA TUG1 derived from human urine-derived stem cells attenuates renal ischemia/reperfusion injury by interacting with SRSF1 to regulate ASCL4-mediated ferroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35841017/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LncRNA TUG1 carried by USC-Exo regulates cell ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LncRNA TUG1 regulates the stability of ACSL4 mRNA by interacting with SRSF1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LncRNA TUG1 alleviates IRI-induced AKI by suppressing ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Human urine-derived stem cells (USCs)-derived exosomes (USC-Exo) could improve kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), while the underlying mechanisms of this protective effect remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Human USCs and USC-Exo were isolated and verified by morphology and specific biomarkers. The effects of USC-Exo on ferroptosis and kidney injury were detected in the IRI-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) model in C57BL/6 mice. The effects of USC-Exo on ferroptosis and lncRNA taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) were detected in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-treated human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2). The interaction of SRSF1 and TUG1, ACSL4 was checked via RNA pull-down/RIP and RNA stability assays. The effects of LncRNA TUG1 on SRSF1/ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis were verified in H/R-treated HK-2 cells and the IRI-induced AKI mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; USC-Exo treatment improved kidney injury and ameliorated ferroptosis in IRI-induced AKI mouse models. USC-Exo were rich in lncRNA TUG1, which suppressed ferroptosis in HK-2 cells exposed to H/R. Mechanistically, lncRNA TUG1 regulates the stability of ACSL4 mRNA by interacting with RNA-binding protein SRSF1. In addition, SRSF1 upregulation or ACSL4 downregulation partially reversed the protective effect of lncRNA TUG1 on ferroptosis in H/R-treated HK-2 cells. Further, ACSL4 upregulation partially reversed TUG1&amp;rsquo;s repression on kidney injury and ferroptosis in IRI-induced AKI mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, lncRNA TUG1 carried by USC-Exo regulated ASCL4-mediated ferroptosis by interacting with SRSF1 and then protected IRI-induced AKI. Potentially, USC-Exo rich in lncRNA TUG1 can serve as a promising therapeutic method for IRI-AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of the JAK/STAT Pathway with Baricitinib Reduces the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Caused by Hemorrhagic Shock in Rats</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35837955/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; The aim of this study was to investigate (a) the effects of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway inhibitor (baricitinib) on the MODS in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock (HS) and (b) whether treatment with baricitinib attenuates the activation of JAK/STAT, NF-ÎºB and NLRP3 caused by HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Post-traumatic MODS, which is in part due to excessive systemic inflammation, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The JAK/STAT pathway is a regulator of numerous growth factor and cytokine receptors and, hence, is considered a potential master regulator of many inflammatory signaling processes. However, its role in trauma-hemorrhage is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; An acute HS rat model was performed to determine the effect of baricitinib on MODS. The activation of JAK/STAT, NF-ÎºB and NLRP3 pathways were analyzed by western blotting in the kidney and liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrate here for the first time that treatment with baricitinib (during resuscitation following severe hemorrhage) attenuates the organ injury and dysfunction and the activation of JAK/STAT, NF-ÎºB and NLRP3 pathways caused by HS in the rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results point to a role of the JAK/STAT pathway in the pathophysiology of the organ injury and dysfunction caused by trauma/hemorrhage and indicate that JAK inhibitors, such as baricitinib, may be repurposed for the treatment of the MODS after trauma and/or hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TRAIL protects the immature lung from hyperoxic injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35840556/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hyperoxia-induced pro-inflammatory response and tissue damage constitute pivotal steps leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the immature lung. The pro-inflammatory cytokines are considered attractive candidates for a directed intervention but the complex interplay between inflammatory and developmental signaling pathways requires a comprehensive evaluation before introduction into clinical trials as studied here for the death inducing ligand TRAIL. At birth and during prolonged exposure to oxygen and mechanical ventilation, levels of TRAIL were lower in tracheal aspirates of preterm infants &amp;lt;29 weeks of gestation which developed moderate/severe BPD. These findings were reproduced in the newborn mouse model of hyperoxic injury. The loss of TRAIL was associated with increased inflammation, apoptosis induction and more pronounced lung structural simplification after hyperoxia exposure for 7 days while activation of NFÎºB signaling during exposure to hyperoxia was abrogated. Pretreatment with recombinant TRAIL rescued the developmental distortions in precision cut lung slices of both wildtype and TRAIL-/- mice exposed to hyperoxia. Of importance, TRAIL preserved alveolar type II cells, mesenchymal progenitor cells and vascular endothelial cells. In the situation of TRAIL depletion, our data ascribe oxygen toxicity a more injurious impact on structural lung development. These data are not surprising taking into account the diverse functions of TRAIL and its stimulatory effects on NFÎºB signaling as central driver of survival and development. TRAIL exerts a protective role in the immature lung as observed for the death inducing ligand TNF-Î± before.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Combustion-Derived Particulate PAHs Associated with Small Airway Dysfunction in Elderly Patients with COPD</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35834827/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence of the respiratory effects of ambient organic aerosols (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) among patients with chronic diseases is limited. We aimed to assess whether exposure to ambient particle-bound PAHs could worsen small airway functions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Forty-five COPD patients were recruited with four repeated visits in 2014-2015 in Beijing, China. Parameters of pulmonary function and pulmonary/systemic inflammation and oxidative stress were measured at each visit. Linear mixed-effect models were performed to evaluate the associations between PAHs and measurements. In this study, participants experienced an average PAH level of 61.7 ng/m3. Interquartile range increases in exposure to particulate PAHs at prior up to 7 days were associated with reduced small airway functions, namely, decreases of 17.7-35.5% in forced maximal mid-expiratory flow. Higher levels of particulate PAHs were also associated with heightened lung injury and inflammation and oxidative stress. Stronger overall effects were found for PAHs from traffic emissions and coal burning. Exposure to ambient particulate PAHs was capable of impairing small airway functions in elderly patients with COPD, potentially via inflammation and oxidative stress. These findings highlight the importance of control efforts on organic particulate matter from fossil fuel combustion emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histone demethylase JMJD3 downregulation protects against aberrant force-induced osteoarthritis through epigenetic control of NR4A1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35831280/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent joint disease with no effective treatment strategies. Aberrant mechanical stimuli was demonstrated to be an essential factor for OA pathogenesis. Although multiple studies have detected potential regulatory mechanisms underlying OA and have concentrated on developing novel treatment strategies, the epigenetic control of OA remains unclear. Histone demethylase JMJD3 has been reported to mediate multiple physiological and pathological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, autophagy, and apoptosis. However, the regulation of JMJD3 in aberrant force-related OA and its mediatory effect on disease progression are still unknown. In this work, we confirmed the upregulation of JMJD3 in aberrant force-induced cartilage injury in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, inhibition of JMJD3 by its inhibitor, GSK-J4, or downregulation of JMJD3 by adenovirus infection of sh-JMJD3 could alleviate the aberrant force-induced chondrocyte injury. Mechanistic investigation illustrated that aberrant force induces JMJD3 expression and then demethylates H3K27me3 at the NR4A1 promoter to promote its expression. Further experiments indicated that NR4A1 can regulate chondrocyte apoptosis, cartilage degeneration, extracellular matrix degradation, and inflammatory responses. In vivo, anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) was performed to construct an OA model, and the therapeutic effect of GSK-J4 was validated. More importantly, we adopted a peptide-siRNA nanoplatform to deliver si-JMJD3 into articular cartilage, and the severity of joint degeneration was remarkably mitigated. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that JMJD3 is flow-responsive and epigenetically regulates OA progression. Our work provides evidences for JMJD3 inhibition as an innovative epigenetic therapy approach for joint diseases by utilizing p5RHH-siRNA nanocomplexes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>E-cigarette vaping associated acute lung injury (EVALI): state of science and future research needs</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35822508/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;E-Cigarette (e-cig) Vaping-Associated Acute Lung Injury&amp;rdquo; (EVALI) has been linked to vitamin-E-acetate (VEA) and Î-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), due to their presence in patients&amp;rsquo; e-cigs and biological samples. Lacking standardized methodologies for patients&amp;rsquo; data collection and comprehensive physicochemical/toxicological studies using real-world-vapor exposures, very little data are available, thus the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of EVALI is still unknown. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical appraisal of existing literature on clinical/epidemiological features and physicochemical-toxicological characterization of vaping emissions associated with EVALI. The literature review of 161 medical case reports revealed that the predominant demographic pattern was healthy white male, adolescent, or young adult, vaping illicit/informal THC-containing e-cigs. The main histopathologic pattern consisted of diffuse alveolar damage with bilateral ground-glass-opacities at chest radiograph/CT, and increased number of macrophages or neutrophils and foamy-macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage. The chemical analysis of THC/VEA e-cig vapors showed a chemical difference between THC/VEA and the single THC or VEA. The chemical characterization of vapors from counterfeit THC-based e-cigs or in-house-prepared e-liquids using either cannabidiol (CBD), VEA, or medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), identified many toxicants, such as carbonyls, volatile organic compounds, terpenes, silicon compounds, hydrocarbons, heavy metals, pesticides and various industrial/manufacturing/automotive-related chemicals. There is very scarce published toxicological data on emissions from THC/VEA e-liquids. However, CBD, MCT, and VEA emissions exert varying degrees of cytotoxicity, inflammation, and lung damage, depending on puffing topography and cell line. Major knowledge gaps were identified, including the need for more systematic-standardized epidemiological surveys, comprehensive physicochemical characterization of real-world e-cig emissions, and mechanistic studies linking emission properties to specific toxicological outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intermediary Role of Lung Alveolar Type 1 Cells in Epithelial Repair upon Sendai Virus Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35679221/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lung epithelium forms the first barrier against respiratory pathogens and noxious chemicals; however, little is known about how more than 90% of this barrier, made of AT1 (alveolar type 1) cells, responds to injury. Using the Sendai virus to model natural infection in mice, we find evidence that AT1 cells have an intermediary role by persisting in areas depleted of AT2 cells, upregulating IFN responsive genes, and receding from invading airway cells. Sendai virus infection mobilizes airway cells to form alveolar SOX2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Sry-box 2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) clusters without differentiating into AT1 or AT2 cells. Large AT2 cell-depleted areas remain covered by AT1 cells, which we name &amp;ldquo;AT2-less regions&amp;rdquo;, and are replaced by SOX2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clusters spreading both basally and luminally. AT2 cell proliferation and differentiation are largely confined to topologically distal regions and form &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; alveolar surface, with limited contribution to &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; repairs of AT2-less regions. Time-course single-cell RNA sequencing profiling and RNAscope validation suggest enhanced immune responses and altered growth signals in AT1 cells. Our comprehensive spatiotemporal and genomewide study highlights the hitherto unappreciated role of AT1 cells in lung injury-repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective role of tissue-resident Tregs in a murine model of beryllium-induced disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35819849/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD4+ T cells drive the immunopathogenesis of chronic beryllium disease (CBD), and their recruitment to the lung heralds the onset of granulomatous inflammation. We have shown that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Tregs control granuloma formation in an HLA-DP2 Tg model of CBD. In these mice, beryllium oxide (BeO) exposure resulted in the accumulation of 3 distinct CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell subsets in the lung, with the majority of tissue-resident memory cells expressing FoxP3. The amount of Be regulated the number of total and antigen-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and Tregs in the lungs of HLA-DP2 Tg mice. Depletion of Tregs increased the number of IFN-Î³-producing CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and enhanced lung injury, while mice treated with IL-2/Î±IL-2 complexes had increased Tregs and reduced inflammation and Be-responsive T cells in the lung. BeO-experienced resident Tregs suppressed anti-CD3-induced proliferation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in a contact-dependent manner. CTLA-4 and ICOS blockade, as well as the addition of LPS to BeO-exposed mice, increased the effector T cell (Teff)/Treg ratio and enhanced lung injury. Collectively, these data show that the protective role of tissue-resident Tregs is dependent on quantity of Be exposure and is overcome by blocking immune regulatory molecules or additional environmental insults.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Locus on Chromosome 15 Contributes to Acute Ozone-induced Lung Injury in Collaborative Cross Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35816602/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-induced respiratory toxicity varies considerably within the human population and across inbred mouse strains, indicative of gene-environment interactions (GxE). Though previous studies have identified several quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes underlying responses to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exposure, precise mechanisms of susceptibility remain incompletely described. We sought to update our understanding of the genetic architecture of O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; responsiveness using the Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred mouse panel. We evaluated hallmark O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced inflammation and injury phenotypes in 56 CC strains after exposure to filtered air or 2 ppm O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and performed focused genetic analysis of variation in lung injury, as reflected by protein in lung lavage fluid. Strain-dependent responses to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were clear, and QTL mapping revealed two novel loci on Chr (Chromosomes) 10 (peak, 26.2 Mb; 80% confidence interval [CI], 24.6-43.6 Mb) and 15 (peak, 47.1 Mb; 80% CI, 40.2-54.9 Mb), the latter surpassing the 95% significance threshold. At the Chr 15 locus, C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ founder haplotypes were associated with higher lung injury responses compared with all other CC founder haplotypes. With further statistical analysis and a weight of evidence approach, we delimited the Chr 15 QTL to an â¼2 Mb region containing 21 genes (10 protein coding) and nominated three candidate genes, namely &lt;em&gt;Oxr1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rspo2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Angpt1&lt;/em&gt;. Gene and protein expression data further supported &lt;em&gt;Oxr1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Angpt1&lt;/em&gt; as priority candidate genes. In summary, we have shown that O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced lung injury is modulated by genetic variation, identified two high priority candidate genes, and demonstrated the value of the CC for detecting GxE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) induces lung injury and fibrosis through neutrophil extracellular traps</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35835272/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) is an extensively used plasticizer that has aroused widespread concern about its potential toxicity. Previous evidences demonstrate that BBP exposure is associated with asthma and impaired lung function. Accumulating data indicates that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a particular manner of neutrophil death, play a vital role in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases. However, the immunotoxicity effects of BBP in lung injury are unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the potential impacts of BBP-induced NETs on lung injury and fibrosis. Mice treated with BBP exhibited significant lung injury, with alveolar hemorrhage, lung edema and increased neutrophil infiltration. Meanwhile, BBP promoted extensive neutrophil infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and NETs deposition in lung tissues. Moreover, BBP clearly triggered NETs formation in vitro, which was confirmed by net-like structures decorated with myeloperoxidase and citrullinated histone H3. Furthermore, BBP fueled glucose uptake and ROS burst of neutrophils playing essential roles during NETs formation. Additionally, we proved that NETs could promote fibrogenesis in murine lung epithelial cells and observed lung fibrosis remarkably after BBP-induced injury. Taken together, our findings indicated that exposure to BBP could increase the risk for lung injury and fibrosis by disturbing innate immunity via NETs formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histones of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Induce CD11b Expression in Brain Pericytes Via Dectin-1 after Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35819574/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain pericyte is a unique and indispensable part of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and contributes to several pathological processes in traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which pericytes are regulated in the damaged brain are largely unknown. Here, we show that the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) induces the appearance of CD11b+ pericytes after TBI. These CD11b+ pericyte subsets are characterized by increased permeability and pro-inflammatory profiles compared to CD11b- pericytes. Moreover, histones from NETs by Dectin-1 facilitate CD11b induction in brain pericytes in PKC-c-Jun dependent manner, resulting in neuroinflammation and BBB dysfunction after TBI. These data indicate that neutrophil-NET-pericyte and histone-Dectin-1-CD11b are possible mechanisms for the activation and dysfunction of pericytes. Targeting NETs formation and Dectin-1 are promising means of treating TBI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-17A aggravates asthma-induced intestinal immune injury by promoting neutrophil trafficking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the concept of the gut-lung axis reinforced in recent years, emerging evidence has shown that intestinal homeostasis is vital for lung health. Nevertheless, the impacts of lung homeostasis on intestinal tracts and their mechanism are rarely studied. Our results showed that papain-induced asthmatic mice exhibited apparent colonic injuries compared with controls, including increased intestinal permeability, neutrophil and Th17 infiltration in the colonic lamina propria. Moreover, the intranasal administration of papain aggravated such colonic injuries in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, as evidenced by increased occult blood scores, shortened colon length, and accumulated neutrophils. The level of IL-17A was also higher in the serum of asthmatic mice than wild-type mice. Interestingly, the pathologic scores, the proportion of Th17 cells, and neutrophil infiltration in the colon were markedly reduced after IL-17A blocking. Similarly, longer length, lower pathologic scores, and fewer neutrophils were also observed in the colon of IL-17-deficient asthmatic mice. More importantly, we demonstrated that severe gastrointestinal symptoms could accompany clinical asthmatics. The frequencies of Th17 cells and the mRNA expression of IL-17A in the peripheral blood of these patients were significantly enhanced. Besides, the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale scores positively correlated with the frequencies of Th17 in asthmatics. These findings enlighten that IL-17A aggravates asthma-induced intestinal immune injury by promoting neutrophil trafficking, which facilitates the exploration of new potential biomarkers to treat asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial PKM2 deacetylation by procyanidin B2-induced SIRT3 upregulation alleviates lung ischemia/reperfusion injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35821123/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apoptosis is a critical event in the pathogenesis of lung ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), an important deacetylase predominantly localized in mitochondria, regulates diverse physiological processes, including apoptosis. However, the detailed mechanisms by which SIRT3 regulates lung I/R injury remain unclear. Many polyphenols strongly regulate the sirtuin family. In this study, we found that a polyphenol compound, procyanidin B2 (PCB2), activated SIRT3 in mouse lungs. Due to this effect, PCB2 administration attenuated histological lesions, relieved pulmonary dysfunction, and improved the survival rate of the murine model of lung I/R injury. Additionally, this treatment inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced A549 cell apoptosis and rescued Bcl-2 expression. Using Sirt3-knockout mice and specific SIRT3 knockdown in vitro, we further found that SIRT3 strongly protects against lung I/R injury. Sirt3 deficiency or enzymatic inactivation substantially aggravated lung I/R-induced pulmonary lesions, promoted apoptosis, and abolished PCB2-mediated protection. Mitochondrial pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) inhibits apoptosis by stabilizing Bcl-2. Here, we found that PKM2 accumulates and is hyperacetylated in mitochondria upon lung I/R injury. By screening the potential sites of PKM2 acetylation, we found that SIRT3 deacetylates the K433 residue of PKM2 in A549 cells. Transfection with a deacetylated mimic plasmid of PKM2 noticeably reduced apoptosis, while acetylated mimic transfection abolished the protective effect of PKM2. Furthermore, PKM2 knockdown or inhibition in vivo significantly abrogated the antiapoptotic effects of SIRT3 upregulation. Collectively, this study provides the first evidence that the SIRT3/PKM2 pathway is a protective target for the suppression of apoptosis in lung I/R injury. Moreover, this study identifies K433 deacetylation of PKM2 as a novel modification that regulates its anti-apoptotic activity. In addition, PCB2-mediated modulation of the SIRT3/PKM2 pathway may significantly protect against lung I/R injury, suggesting a novel prophylactic strategy for lung I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Î´ Deficiency Protects From Antimyeloperoxidase Vasculitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35818684/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a systemic autoimmune disease in which glomerulonephritis is an important manifestation. Antibodies against myeloperoxidase (MPO) or proteinase 3 are thought to be important in pathogenesis. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase Î´ (PI3KÎ´) mediates a number of effects in lymphocytes, but its role in myeloid cell responses is less clear. Therefore, this study was undertaken to assess this in a preclinical model of glomerulonephritis induced by the transfer of antibodies to MPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; D910A mice with inactive PI3KÎ´ were compared with wild-type controls. Disease protocols allowed for a comparison of experimental groups in the setting of both mild and more severe disease. Adoptive transfer experiments were performed, with flow cytometric analysis of digested kidneys taken at the end of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; With mild disease, D910A mice had fewer glomerular macrophages, fewer glomerular neutrophils, and reduced albuminuria compared with wild-type controls. With more severe disease, they also had fewer glomerular crescents and lower serum creatinine levels, indicating protection from acute kidney injury. Adoptive transfer experiments showed a defect in the recruitment of D910A monocytes to the diseased kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Mice with inactive PI3KÎ´ were protected from anti-MPO vasculitis. This is due to cell intrinsic defect in the recruitment of monocytes to the kidney. These findings suggest that PI3KÎ´ is a potential therapeutic target in AAV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell analysis highlights differences in druggable pathways underlying adaptive or fibrotic kidney regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35821371/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kidney has tremendous capacity to repair after acute injury, however, pathways guiding adaptive and fibrotic repair are poorly understood. We developed a model of adaptive and fibrotic kidney regeneration by titrating ischemic injury dose. We performed detailed biochemical and histological analysis and profiled transcriptomic changes at bulk and single-cell level (&amp;gt; 110,000 cells) over time. Our analysis highlights kidney proximal tubule cells as key susceptible cells to injury. Adaptive proximal tubule repair correlated with fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. We identify a specific maladaptive/profibrotic proximal tubule cluster after long ischemia, which expresses proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines and myeloid cell chemotactic factors. Druggability analysis highlights pyroptosis/ferroptosis as vulnerable pathways in these profibrotic cells. Pharmacological targeting of pyroptosis/ferroptosis in vivo pushed cells towards adaptive repair and ameliorates fibrosis. In summary, our single-cell analysis defines key differences in adaptive and fibrotic repair and identifies druggable pathways for pharmacological intervention to prevent kidney fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advances in the Regulation of Macrophage Polarization by Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Implications for ALI/ARDS Treatment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35880175/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a common condition with high mortality. ALI/ARDS is caused by multiple etiologies, and the main clinical manifestations are progressive dyspnea and intractable hypoxemia. Currently, supportive therapy is the main ALI/ARDS treatment, and there remains a lack of targeted and effective therapeutic strategies. Macrophages are important components of innate immunity. M1 macrophages are pro-inflammatory, while M2 macrophages are anti-inflammatory and promote tissue repair. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are stem cells with broad application prospects in tissue regeneration due to their multi-directional differentiation potential along with their anti-inflammatory and paracrine properties. MSCs can regulate the balance of M1/M2 macrophage polarization to improve the prognosis of ALI/ARDS. In this paper, we review the mechanisms by which MSCs regulate macrophage polarization and the signaling pathways associated with polarization. This review is expected to provide new targets for the treatment of ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interleukin 24 promotes cell death in renal epithelial cells and is associated with acute renal injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35801504/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a major cause of acute kidney injury. Many cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. IL24 is a member of the IL10 family and has gained importance because of its apoptosis-inducing effects in tumor disease besides its immunoregulative function. Littles is known about the role of IL24 in kidney disease. Using a mouse model, we found that IL24 is upregulated in the kidney after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and that tubular epithelial cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells are the source of IL24. Mice lacking IL24 are protected from renal injury and inflammation. Cell culture studies showed that IL24 induces apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells, which is accompanied by an increased endoplasmatic reticulum stress response. Moreover, IL24 induces robust expression of endogenous IL24 in tubular cells, fostering ER-stress and apoptosis. In kidney transplant recipients with delayed graft function and patients at high risk to develop acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery IL24 is upregulated in the kidney and serum. Taken together, IL24 can serve as a biomarker, plays an important mechanistic role involving both extracellular and intracellular targets, and is a promising therapeutic target in patients at risk of or with ischemia-induced acute kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Network Pharmacology and Experimental Validation to Explore the Mechanism of Qing-Jin-Hua-Tan-Decoction Against Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35873580/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qing-Jin-Hua-Tan-Decoction (QJHTD), a classic famous Chinese ancient prescription, has been used for treatment of pulmonary diseases since Ming Dynasty. A total of 22 prototype compounds of QJHTD absorbed into rat blood were chosen as candidates for the pharmacological network analysis and molecular docking. The targets from the intersection of compound target and ALI disease targets were used for GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Molecular docking was adopted to further verify the interactions between 22 components and the top 20 targets with higher degree values in the component-target-pathway network. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments were performed to verify the results of network pharmacology using SPR experiments, Western blot experiments, and the PMA-induced neutrophils to produce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) model. The compound-target-pathway network includes 176 targets and 20 signaling pathways in which the degree of MAPK14, CDK2, EGFR, F2, SRC, and AKT1 is higher than that of other targets and which may be potential disease targets. The biological processes in QJHTD for ALI mainly included protein phosphorylation, response to wounding, response to bacterium, regulation of inflammatory response, and so on. KEGG enrichment analyses revealed multiple signaling pathways, including lipid and atherosclerosis, HIF-1 signaling pathway, renin-angiotensin system, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation. The molecular docking results showed that baicalin, oroxylin A-7-glucuronide, hispidulin-7-O-Î²-D-glucuronide, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, tianshic acid, and mangiferin can be combined with most of the targets, which might be the core components of QJHTD in treatment of ALI. Direct binding ability of baicalein, wogonin, and baicalin to thrombin protein was all micromolar, and their KD values were 11.92 Î¼M, 1.303 Î¼M, and 1.146 Î¼M, respectively, revealed by SPR experiments, and QJHTD could inhibit Src phosphorylation in LPS-activated neutrophils by Western blot experiments. The experimental results of PMA-induced neutrophils to produce NETs indicated that QJHTD could inhibit the production of NETs. This study revealed the active compounds, effective targets, and potential pharmacological mechanisms of QJHTD acting on ALI.

      <title>p53/sirtuin 1/NF-ÎºB Signaling Axis in Chronic Inflammation and Maladaptive Kidney Repair After Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35874713/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation contributes to maladaptive kidney repair, but its regulation is unclear. Here, we report that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is downregulated after repeated low-dose cisplatin (RLDC) injury, and this downregulation leads to p65 acetylation and consequent NF-ÎºB activation resulting in a persistent inflammatory response. RLDC induced the down-regulation of SIRT1 and activation of NF-ÎºB, which were accompanied by chronic tubular damage, tubulointerstitial inflammation, and fibrosis in mice. Inhibition of NF-ÎºB suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic phenotypes in RLDC-treated renal tubular cells. SIRT1 activation by its agonists markedly reduced the acetylation of p65 (a key component of NF-ÎºB), resulting in the attenuation of the inflammatory and fibrotic responses. Conversely, knockdown of SIRT1 exacerbated these cellular changes. At the upstream, p53 was activated after RLDC treatment to repress SIRT1, resulting in p65 acetylation, NF-ÎºB activation and transcription of inflammatory cytokines. In mice, SIRT1 agonists attenuated RLDC-induced chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and renal fibrosis. Together, these results unveil the p53/SIRT1/NF-ÎºB signaling axis in maladaptive kidney repair following RLDC treatment, where p53 represses SIRT1 to increase p65 acetylation for NF-ÎºB activation, leading to chronic renal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can result in prolonged pathologies collectively referred to as post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long COVID. To better understand the mechanism underlying long COVID biology, we compared the short- and long-term systemic responses in the golden hamster after either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 exceeded IAV in its capacity to cause permanent injury to the lung and kidney and uniquely affected the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory epithelium (OE). Despite a lack of detectable infectious virus, the OB and OE demonstrated myeloid and T cell activation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and an interferon response that correlated with behavioral changes extending a month after viral clearance. These sustained transcriptional changes could also be corroborated from tissue isolated from individuals who recovered from COVID-19. These data highlight a molecular mechanism for persistent COVID-19 symptomology and provide a small animal model to explore future therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Size-based effects of anthropogenic ultrafine particles on activation of human lung macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35839670/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anthropogenic particulate matter (PM), suspended air dust that can be inhaled by humans and deposited in the lungs, is one of the main pollutants in the industrialized cities atmosphere. Recent studies have shown that PM has adverse effects on respiratory diseases. These effects are mainly due to the ultrafine particles (PM0.1, PM &amp;lt; 100 nm), which, thanks to their PM size, are efficiently deposited in nasal, tracheobronchial, and alveolar regions. Pulmonary macrophages are a heterogeneous cell population distributed in different lung compartments, whose role in inflammatory response to injury is of particular relevance. In this study, we investigated the effect of PM0.1 on Human Lung Macrophages (HLMs) activation evaluated as proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine release, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]i). Furthermore, PM0.1, after removal of organic fraction, was fractionated in nanoparticles both smaller (NP20) and bigger (NP100) than 20 nm by a properlydeveloped analytical protocol, allowed isolating their individual contribution. Interestingly, while PM0.1 and NP20 induced stimulatory effects on HLM cytokines release, NP100 had not effect. In particular, PM0.1 induced IL-6, IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, but not CXCL8, release from HLMs. Moreover, PM0.1, NP20 and NP100 did not induce Î²-glucuronidase release, a preformed mediator contained in HLMs. The long time necessary for cytokines release (18 h) suggested that PM0.1 and NP20 could induce ex-novo production of the tested mediators. Accordingly, after 6 h of incubation, PM0.1 and NP20 induced mRNA expression of IL-6, TNF-Î± and IL-1Î². Moreover, NP20 induced ROS production and [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]i increase in a time-dependent manner, without producing cytotoxicity. Collectively, the present data highlight the main proinflammatory role of NP20 among PM fractions. This is particularly of concern because this fraction is not currently covered by legal limits as it is not easily measured at the exhausts by the available technical methodologies, suggesting that it is mandatory to search for new monitoring techniques and strategies for limiting NP20 formation&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deciphering the role of damage-associated molecular patterns and inflammatory responses in acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35809663/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and causes great mortality. ALI presents with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, cell death, destruction of alveoli-endothelial barriers, and neutrophil infiltration in lung tissues. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules released from damaged cells due to infection, trauma, etc. DAMPs activate innate and adaptive immunity, trigger inflammatory responses, and are important in the initiation and development of ALI. We reviewed the literatures on DAMPs in ALI. Alveolar macrophages (AMs), neutrophils, and epithelial cells (AECs) are important in the pathogenesis of ALI. We comprehensively analyzed the interaction between DAMPs and AMs, alveolar neutrophils, and AECs. During the initial stage of ALI, ruptured cell membranes or destroyed mitochondria release DAMPs. DAMPs activate the inflammasome in nearby sentinel immune cells, such as AMs. AMs produce IL-1Î² and other cytokines. These mediators upregulate adhesion molecules of the capillary endothelium that facilitate neutrophil recruitment. The recruited neutrophils detect DAMPs using formyl peptide receptors on the membrane, guiding their migration to the injured site. The accumulation of immune cells, cytokines, chemokines, proteases, etc., results in diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary hyperpermeability with protein-rich fluid retention. Some clinical studies have shown that patients with ALI with higher circulating DAMPs have higher mortality rates. In conclusion, DAMPs are important in the initiation and progression of ALI. The interactions between DAMPs and AMs, neutrophils, and AECs are important in ALI. This review comprehensively addresses the mechanisms of DAMPs and their interactions in ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Methyl eugenol protects the kidney from oxidative damage in mice by blocking the Nrf2 nuclear export signal through activation of the AMPK/GSK3Î² axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35794373/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disrupted redox homeostasis contributes to renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Abundant natural products can activate nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), thereby providing therapeutic benefits. Methyl eugenol (ME), an analog of the phenolic compound eugenol, has the ability to induce Nrf2 activity. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of ME against renal oxidative damage in vivo and in vitro. An IR-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) model was established in mice. ME (20 mgÂ·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;Â·d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.p.) was administered to mice on 5 consecutive days before IR surgery. We showed that ME administration significantly attenuated renal destruction, improved the survival rate, reduced excessive oxidative stress and inhibited mitochondrial lesions in AKI mice. We further demonstrated that ME administration significantly enhanced Nrf2 activity and increased the expression of downstream antioxidative molecules. Similar results were observed in vitro in hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR)-exposed proximal tubule epithelial cells following pretreatment with ME (40 Î¼molÂ·L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). In both renal oxidative damage models, ME induced Nrf2 nuclear retention in tubular cells. Using specific inhibitors (CC and DIF-3) and molecular docking, we demonstrated that ME bound to the binding pocket of AMPK with high affinity and activated the AMPK/GSK3Î² axis, which in turn blocked the Nrf2 nuclear export signal. In addition, ME alleviated the development of renal fibrosis induced by nonfatal IR, which is frequently encountered in the clinic. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ME modulates the AMPK/GSK3Î² axis to regulate the cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of Nrf2, resulting in Nrf2 nuclear retention and thereby enhancing antioxidant target gene transcription that protects the kidney from oxidative damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MUC1-mediated Macrophage Activation Promotes Colitis-associated Colorectal Cancer via Activating the Interleukin-6/ Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 Axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35809803/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background &amp;amp; aims:&lt;/em&gt; MUC1 is abnormally expressed in colorectal cancer, including colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), but its role in tumorigenesis is unclear. This study investigated MUC1&amp;rsquo;s effects in murine models of colitis and CAC and elucidated mechanisms of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Colitis and CAC were induced in mice by exposure to dextran sodium sulfate or azoxymethane plus dextran sodium sulphate. Clinical parameters, immune cell infiltration, and tumor development were monitored throughout disease progression. Experiments in knockout mice and bone marrow chimeras were combined with an exploration of immune cell abundance and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Deficiency of Muc1 suppressed inflammation, inhibited tumor progression, increased abundance of CD8+ T lymphocytes, and reduced abundance of macrophages in colon tumors. Bone marrow chimeras showed promotion of CAC was primarily mediated by Muc1-expressing hematopoietic cells, and that MUC1 promoted a pro-tumoral immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype within tumors. Mechanistic studies revealed that Muc1 deficiency remarkably reduced interleukin-6 levels in the colonic tissues and tumors that was mainly produced by infiltrating macrophages at day 21, 42, and 85. In bone marrow-derived macrophages, MUC1 promoted responsiveness to chemoattractant and promoted activation into a phenotype with high Il6 and Ido1 expression, secreting factors which inhibited CD8+ T cell proliferation. MUC1 potently drives macrophages to produce interleukin-6, which in turn drives a pro-tumorigenic activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in colon epithelial tumor and stromal cells, ultimately increasing the occurrence and development of CAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings provide cellular and molecular mechanisms for the pro-tumorigenic functions of MUC1 in the inflamed colon. Therapeutic strategies to inhibit MUC1 signal transduction warrant consideration for the prevention or therapy of CAC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil and Macrophage Response in Acinetobacter Baumannii Infection and Their Relationship to Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35873147/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) infection has become a threat to global public health. AB is one of the main pathogens causing nosocomial infections, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia. AB easily develops resistance against a variety of antibiotics, which makes the treatment of AB infections difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to study new treatment plans like anti-infection immunity. Both animal models of AB infection and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; cell experiments show that macrophages are activated in the early stage of the immune response and regulate the recruitment of neutrophils, thus playing a role in clearing AB. AB components and the immune responses they induce can lead to injury of the infected organ, mostly in the lungs. Understanding the response of innate immunity to ABs at different stages after infection and the relationship between the response and lung injury can help to develop new immunotherapy methods and prevent lung injury. This article provides a comprehensive review of the response of neutrophils and macrophages to AB infection and their association with lung injury to develop effective therapies for AB infection and prevent lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oral administration of asparagine and 3-indolepropionic acid prolongs survival time of rats with traumatic colon injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35791006/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Traumatic colon injury (TCI) is a common disease during wartime. Prolongation of posttraumatic survival time is an effective approach to patient outcome improvement. However, there is a lack of basic research in this field. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying TCI progression and to develop novel regimens to buy time for TCI patients on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 669 Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Surgical colon incision was performed to generate the TCI rat model. The landscape of colon microbiota compositions was depicted using 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolites in the intestinal contents were detected by metabolomics profiling. The signaling transduction in the intestinal epithelium was investigated using antibody microarrays and Western blotting. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to measure the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î± in intestines and plasma for the detection of inflammatory responses. Diamine oxidase, D-lactate and endotoxin in plasma and protein expression of zonula occludens 1 and occludin were selected as the indicators of intestinal barrier permeability. To investigate alterations of microbiota symbiosis, the relative abundances of specific bacterial genera were detected using quantitative real-time PCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; As a type of lethal injury, TCI induced acute disruption of intestinal homeostasis, characterized by inflammatory responses, intestinal barrier hyperpermeability and microbiota dysbiosis (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Significant alterations in bacterial metabolic patterns were detected with decreases in many metabolites. After a series of screenings, we found that oral administration of asparagine (Asn) and 3-indolepropionic acid (IPA) effectively prolonged posttraumatic survival time (Asn plus IPA vs. Vehicle: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.105, 95% CI 0.031-0.356, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0003) and restored intestinal homeostasis in TCI rats (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Mechanistically, this combinational strategy protected the rats against TCI through synergistic activation of Akt signaling in the intestinal epithelium (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Abrupt dysregulation of intestinal homeostasis plays a critical role in the progression toward TCI-induced death. Oral administration of Asn plus IPA may serve as an effective regimen to restore intestinal functions and prolong the posttraumatic survival time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 Pathway Protects against Ferroptosis in Radiation-Induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35847598/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is one of the most common, serious, and dose-limiting toxicities of thoracic radiotherapy. A primary cause for this is the radiation-induced cell death. Ferroptosis is a recently recognized form of regulated cell death, characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS generated by irradiation might be the original trigger of ferroptosis in RILI. In addition, activation of the P62-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway has been shown to blunt ferroptosis and thus acts as a protective factor. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the protective effect of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway against radiation-induced ferroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells. First, we found that radiation induced ferroptosis in vitro using a RILI cell model, which could be significantly reduced by ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a specific ferroptosis inhibitor. Additionally, overexpression of P62 interacted with Keap1 to facilitate the translocation of NRF2 into the nucleus and promote the expression of its target proteins, including quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1). In summary, our results demonstrated that the activation of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway prevents radiation-induced ferroptosis in RILI cells, providing a theoretical basis of finding a potential therapeutic approach for RILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Raised Serum Markers of T Cell Activation and Exhaustion in Granulomatous-Lymphocytic Interstitial Lung Disease in Common Variable Immunodeficiency</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35789314/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/article/35789314/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; About 20-30% of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) develop granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD) as one of several non-infectious complications to their immunodeficiency. The purpose of this study was to identify biomarkers that could distinguish GLILD from other non-infectious complications in CVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We analyzed serum biomarkers related to inflammation, pulmonary epithelium injury, fibrogenesis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and compared three subgroups of CVID: GLILD patients (n = 16), patients with other non-infectious complications (n = 37), and patients with infections only (n = 20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We found that GLILD patients had higher levels of sCD25, sTIM-3, IFN-Î³, and TNF, reflecting T cell activation and exhaustion, compared to both CVID patients with other inflammatory complications and CVID with infections only. GLILD patients also had higher levels of SP-D and CC16, proteins related to pulmonary epithelium injury, as well as the ECM remodeling marker MMP-7, than patients with other non-infectious complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; GLILD patients have elevated serum markers of T cell activation and exhaustion, pulmonary epithelium injury, and ECM remodeling, pointing to potentially important pathways in GLILD pathogenesis, novel targets for therapy, and promising biomarkers for clinical evaluation of these patients.

      <title>CircRNA Samd4 induces cardiac repair after myocardial infarction by blocking mitochondria-derived ROS output</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35791879/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from oxygen-dependent mitochondrial metabolism are the essential drivers of cardiomyocyte (CM) cell-cycle arrest in adulthood. Mitochondria-localized circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in regulating mitochondria-derived ROS production, but their functions in cardiac regeneration are still unknown. Herein, we investigated the functions and underlying mechanism of mitochondria-localized circSamd4 in cardiac regeneration. We found that circSamd4 was selectively expressed in fetal and neonatal CMs. The transcription factor Nrf2 controlled circSamd4 expression by binding to the promoter of circSamd4 host gene. CircSamd4 overexpression reduced while circSamd4 silenced increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and subsequent oxidative DNA damage. Moreover, circSamd4 overexpression induced CM proliferation and prevented CM apoptosis, which reduced the size of the fibrotic area and improved cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI). Mechanistically, circSamd4 reduced oxidative stress generation and maintained mitochondrial dynamics by inducing the mitochondrial translocation of the Vcp protein, which downregulated Vdac1 expression and prevented the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) from opening. Our findings suggest that circSamd4 is a novel therapeutic target for heart failure after MI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kidney diseases are global public health concerns lacking effective treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both native and bioengineered EVs are prime candidates for next-generation renal therapeutics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVs can be tailored to target specific renal cells and prolong kidney retention for enhanced efficacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVs can act as natural therapeutic agents or smart drug carriers fighting against renal diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the ever-increasing burden of kidney disease, the need for developing new therapeutics to manage this disease has never been greater. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural membranous nanoparticles present in virtually all organisms. Given their excellent delivery capacity in the body, EVs have emerged as a frontier technology for drug delivery and have the potential to usher in a new era of nanomedicine for kidney disease. This review is focused on why EVs are such compelling drug carriers and how to release their fullest potentiality in renal therapeutics. We discuss the unique features of EVs compared to artificial nanoparticles and outline the engineering technologies and steps in developing EV-based therapeutics, with an emphasis on the emerging approaches to target renal cells and prolong kidney retention. We also explore the applications of EVs as natural therapeutics or as drug carriers in the treatment of renal disorders and present our views on the critical challenges in manufacturing EVs as next-generation renal therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Induction of reactive oxygen species by mechanical stretch drives endothelin production in neonatal pig renal epithelial cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35841629/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vasoactive endothelin (ET) is generated by ET converting enzyme (ECE)-induced proteolytic processing of pro-molecule big ET to biologically active peptides. H2O2 has been shown to increase the expression of ECE1 via transactivation of its promoter. The present study demonstrates that H2O2 triggered ECE1-dependent ET1-3 production in neonatal pig proximal tubule (PT) epithelial cells. A uniaxial stretch of PT cells decreased catalase, increased NADPH oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4, and increased H2O2 levels. Stretch also increased cellular ECE1, an effect reversed by EUK-134 (a synthetic superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic), NOX inhibitor apocynin, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of NOX2 and NOX4. Short-term unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), an inducer of renal tubular cell stretch and oxidative stress, increased renal ET1-3 generation and vascular resistance (RVR) in neonatal pigs. Despite removing the obstruction, UUO-induced increase in RVR persisted, resulting in early acute kidney injury (AKI). ET receptor (ETR)-operated Ca2+ entry in renal microvascular smooth muscle (SM) via transient receptor potential channel 3 (TRPC3) channels reduced renal blood flow and increased RVR. Although acute reversible UUO (rUUO) did not change protein expression levels of ETR and TRPC3 in renal microvessels, inhibition of ECE1, ETR, and TRPC3 protected against renal hypoperfusion, RVR increase, and early AKI. These data suggest that mechanical stretch-driven oxyradical generation stimulates ET production in neonatal pig renal epithelial cells. ET activates renal microvascular SM TRPC3, leading to persistent vasoconstriction and reduction in renal blood flow. These mechanisms may underlie rUUO-induced renal insufficiency in infants.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lysophosphatidylcholine Alleviates Acute Lung Injury by Regulating Neutrophil Motility and Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35859904/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is predominantly initiated by bacterial infection and can cause systemic inflammation, which frequently leads to rapid death of the patient. However, this acute systemic inflammatory response requires further investigation from the perspectives of clinical judgment criteria and early treatment strategies for the relief of symptoms. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 18:0 may relieve septic symptoms, but the relevant mechanism is not clearly understood. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of LPC as a therapeutic treatment for acute inflammation in the lung induced by lipopolysaccharide in mice. Systemic inflammation of mice was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inoculation to investigate the role of LPC in the migration and the immune response of neutrophils during acute lung injury. By employing two-photon intravital imaging of the LPS-stimulated LysM-GFP mice and other &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; assays, we examined whether LPC alleviates the inflammatory effect of sepsis. We also tested the effect of LPC to human neutrophils from healthy control and sepsis patients. Our data showed that LPC treatment reduced the infiltration of innate immune cells into the lung. Specifically, LPC altered neutrophil migratory patterns and enhanced phagocytic efficacy in the damaged lung. Moreover, LPC treatment reduced the release of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET), which can damage tissue in the inflamed organ and exacerbate disease. It also reduced human neutrophil migration under inflammatory environment. Our results suggest that LPC can alleviate sepsis-induced lung inflammation by regulating the function of neutrophils. These findings provide evidence for the beneficial application of LPC treatment as a potential therapeutic strategy for sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting p65 to inhibit Cas3 transcription by Onjisaponin B for radiation damage therapy in p65&#43;/- mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35816993/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35816993/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; In response to radiation injury, p65 becomes activated. The formation of p65 is one target of Onjisaponin B (OB), but it has not been studied in radioprotection. In addition, there is a binding site for p65 in the promoter region of Cas3. This study evaluates the use of OB as an intervention to modulate p65/Cas3 following radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to confirm that OB regulated the transcription of Cas3 via p65 to overcome radiation-induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study design and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Cells and mice were exposed to X-rays at a dose of 6 Gy. Immunofluorescence was used to locate intracellular p65. For the protein and mRNA analyses, Western blotting and RT-qPCR-based assays were conducted accordingly. HE staining was used to observe pathological changes in tissues. DNA damage was detected by the comet assay and DNA ladder assay. Next, apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and Hoechst staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared with the radiation group, the expression levels of p-p65 and c-Cas3 in the drug group were significantly down-regulated by OB 20 Âµg/ml. When the expression of p65 was suppressed in V79 and TC cells, OB did not significantly inhibit the activation of p65 or Cas3 in response to irradiation, nor did it significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of p65 and subsequent nuclear translocation. Overexpression of p65 in V79 and MTEC-1 cells resulted in OB significantly inhibiting the activation of p65 and Cas3, and the phosphorylation and translocation of p65 into the nucleus. At 3 d for V79 cells and 24 h for MTEC-1 cells after radiation, compared with the Cas3 over plasmid transfection group, the drug transfection group had no significant effect on reducing apoptosis. In p65+/- mice, expression of the p65 gene was knocked down, leading to increased tissue apoptosis and inflammation, and serious tissue pathological changes. The inhibition of p65 activation by OB after radiation exposure was not apparent in the thymus, although it was observed in the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; OB interfered with radiation injury by targeting and regulating p65/Cas3. Therefore, it has been concluded that p65 is an important target molecule for the treatment of radiation injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TLR4-SIRT3 Mechanism Modulates Mitochondrial and Redox Homeostasis and Promotes EPCs Recruitment and Survival</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35832490/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low survival rate of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; which are susceptible to adverse microenvironments including inflammation and oxidative stress has become one primary challenge of EPCs transplantation for regenerative therapy. Recent studies reported functional expression of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 on EPCs and dose-dependent effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on cellular oxidative stress and angiogenic properties. However, the involved mechanism has not yet been elucidated well, and the influence of TLR4 signaling on EPCs survival and function &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; is unknown. In the present study, we observed the effects of LPS and TLR4/SIRT3 on EPCs mitochondrial permeability and intracellular mitochondrial superoxide. We employed the monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arteriolar injury model to observe the effects of TLR4/SIRT3 on the recruitment and survival of transplanted EPCs. We found the destructive effects of 10 Î¼g/mL LPS on mitochondrial homeostasis, and cellular viability was mediated by TLR4/SIRT3 signals at least partially, and the TLR4 mediates the early-stage recruitment of transplanted EPCs in pulmonary arteriolar inflammation injury; however, SIRT3 has more contribution to the survival of incorporated EPCs and ameliorated arteriolar remodeling in lung vascular tissue. The study provides insights for the critical role of TLR4/SIRT3 in LPS-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial disorder in EPCs &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. The TLR4/SIRT3 signaling is important for EPCs resistance against inflammation and oxidative stress and may represent a new manipulating target for developing efficient cell therapy strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tight Junctions, the Epithelial Barrier, and Toll-like Receptor-4 During Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung epithelium is constantly exposed to the environment and is critically important for the orchestration of initial responses to infectious organisms, toxins, and allergic stimuli, and maintenance of normal gaseous exchange and pulmonary function. The integrity of lung epithelium, fluid balance, and transport of molecules is dictated by the tight junctions (TJs). The TJs are formed between adjacent cells. We have focused on the topic of the TJ structure and function in lung epithelial cells. This review includes a summary of the last twenty years of literature reports published on the disrupted TJs and epithelial barrier in various lung conditions and expression and regulation of specific TJ proteins against pathogenic stimuli. We discuss the molecular signaling and crosstalk among signaling pathways that control the TJ structure and function. The Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) recognizes the pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns released during lung injury and inflammation and coordinates cellular responses. The molecular aspects of TLR4 signaling in the context of TJs or the epithelial barrier are not fully known. We describe the current knowledge and possible networking of the TLR4-signaling with cellular and molecular mechanisms of TJs, lung epithelial barrier function, and resistance to treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kidney targeting of formoterol containing polymeric nanoparticles improves recovery from ischemia reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35779607/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Î²2 adrenergic receptor agonist, formoterol, is an inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis and restorer of mitochondrial and kidney function in acute and chronic models of kidney injury. Unfortunately, systemic administration of formoterol has the potential for adverse cardiovascular effects, increased heart rate, and decreased blood pressure. To minimize these effects, we developed biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric nanoparticles containing formoterol that target the kidney, thereby decreasing the effective dose, and lessen cardiovascular effects while restoring kidney function after injury. Male C57Bl/6 mice, treated with these nanoparticles daily, had reduced ischemia-reperfusion-induced serum creatinine and kidney cortex kidney injury molecule-1 levels by 78% and 73% respectively, compared to control mice six days after injury. With nanoparticle therapy, kidney cortical mitochondrial number and proteins reduced by ischemic injury, recovered to levels of sham-operated mice. Tubular necrosis was reduced 69% with nanoparticles treatment. Nanoparticles improved kidney recovery even when the dosing frequency was reduced from daily to two days per week. Finally, compared to treatment with formoterol-free drug alone, these nanoparticles did not increase heart rate nor decrease blood pressure. Thus, targeted kidney delivery of formoterol-containing nanoparticles is an improvement in standard formoterol therapy for ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injuries by decreasing the dose, dosing frequency, and cardiac side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a novel cell death method discovered in recent years. It is usually accompanied by massive accumulations of iron and lipid peroxidation during cell death. Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis is closely associated with the pathophysiological processes of many diseases, such as tumors, neurological diseases, localized ischemia-reperfusion injury, kidney injury, and hematological diseases. How to intervene in the incidence and development of associated diseases by regulating the ferroptosis of cells has become a hot topic of research. This article provides a review of the role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of acute kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Characterization of a flexible AAV-DTR/DT mouse model of acute epithelial lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35762632/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal models are important to mimic certain pathways or biological aspects of human pathologies including acute and chronic pulmonary diseases. We developed a novel and flexible mouse model of acute epithelial lung injury based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) variant 6.2-mediated expression of the human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR). Following intratracheal administration of diphtheria toxin (DT), a cell-specific death of bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells can be observed. In contrast to other lung injury models, the here described mouse model provides the possibility of targeted injury using specific tropisms of AAV vectors or cell-type-specific promotors to drive the human DTR expression. Also, generation of cell-specific mouse lines is not required. Detailed characterization of the AAV-DTR/DT mouse model including titration of viral genome (vg) load and administered DT amount revealed increasing cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; macrophages, neutrophils, and unspecified cells) and elevation of degenerated cells and infiltrated leukocytes in lung tissue, dependent of vg load and DT dose. Cytokine levels in BAL fluid showed different patterns with higher vg load, e.g., IFNÎ³, TNFÎ±, and IP10 increasing and IL-5 and IL-6 decreasing, whereas lung function was not affected. In addition, laser-capture microdissection (LCM)-based proteomics of bronchial epithelium and alveolar tissue revealed upregulated immune and inflammatory responses in all regions and extracellular matrix deposition in infiltrated alveoli. Overall, our novel AAV-DTR/DT model allows investigation of repair mechanisms following epithelial injury and resembles specific mechanistic aspects of acute and chronic pulmonary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FGF1 alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via suppression of inflammation and oxidative stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35764933/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are devastating clinical disorders with high mortality, and for which more effective therapies are urgently needed. FGF1, the prototype member of the FGF family, is shown to exert protective effects against injurious stimuli in multiple disease models. Here we aimed to evaluate whether FGF1 pretreatment is protective against LPS-induced ALI and elucidate the potential underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; For drug-treated groups, C57B/6 mice received a single i.p. injection of FGF1 (1 mg/kg) 1 h before the LPS challenge or not. To induce the ALI model, the mice were treated by intratracheal instillation of LPS (5 mg/kg). Then, histopathological changes in lung tissues were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. ELISA and qPCR assays were used to detect pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in BALF and lung tissues, respectively. The total number of inflammatory cells (neutrophils and macrophages) in BALF were counted using the Wright-Giemsa method. The expressions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using their respective kits. Western blot and immunostaining were used to evaluate the expressions of antioxidants (Nrf-2, HO-1, SOD2, GPX4, and Catalase), as well as the inflammatory and/or apoptosis-related factors (TLR4, NF-ÎºB, and Cleaved- caspase 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; FGF1 pretreatment significantly ameliorated the LPS-induced histopathological changes, reduced lung wet/dry ratios, ROS and MDA levels, total BALF protein, inflammatory cell infiltration, proinflammatory cytokine levels, and significantly increased the expression of antioxidant proteins (Nrf-2, HO-1, Catalase, and SOD2). In addition, FGF1 pretreatment significantly reduced the expression of TLR4 and cleaved- caspase 3, inhibited NF-ÎºB activation, and reduced LPS-induced cell apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Altogether, our results suggest that FGF1 pretreatment is protective against LPS-induced ALI through mediating anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may be attributed to the downregulation of TLR4 expression and inhibition of NF-ÎºB activation, as well as promotion of antioxidant defenses. Therefore, FGF1 administration may prove beneficial in preventative strategies for ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MicroRNA-1224-5p Aggravates Sepsis-Related Acute Lung Injury in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35799888/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in the development of sepsis-related acute lung injury (ALI). MicroRNA-1224-5p (miR-1224-5p) plays critical roles in regulating inflammatory response and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The present study is aimed at investigating the role and underlying mechanisms of miR-1224-5p in sepsis-related ALI. Mice were intratracheally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 mg/kg) for 12 h to induce sepsis-related ALI. To manipulate miR-1224-5p level, mice were intravenously injected with the agomir, antagomir, or matched controls for 3 consecutive days. Murine peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 6 h to further validate the role of miR-1224-5p &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. To inhibit adenosine 5&amp;rsquo;-monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKÎ±) or peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-Î³), compound C or GW9662 was used &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. We found that miR-1224-5p levels in lungs were elevated by LPS injection, and that the miR-1224-5p antagomir significantly alleviated LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and ALI in mice. Conversely, the miR-1224-5p agomir aggravated inflammatory response, ROS generation, and pulmonary dysfunction in LPS-treated mice. In addition, the miR-1224-5p antagomir reduced, while the miR-1224-5p agomir aggravated LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in murine peritoneal macrophages. Further findings revealed that miR-1224-5p is directly bound to the 3&amp;rsquo;-untranslated regions of PPAR-Î³ and subsequently suppressed PPAR-Î³/AMPKÎ± axis, thereby aggravating LPS-induced ALI &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. We demonstrate for the first time that endogenous miR-1224-5p is a critical pathogenic factor for inflammation and oxidative damage during LPS-induced ALI through inactivating PPAR-Î³/AMPKÎ± axis. Targeting miR-1224-5p may help to develop novel approaches to treat sepsis-related ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prediction of the Mechanism of Sodium Butyrate against Radiation-Induced Lung Injury in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Dynamic Simulations and Molecular Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35837112/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a severe side effect of radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ,and one of the major hindrances to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. Previous studies have confirmed that sodium butyrate (NaB) has potential of anti-radiation toxicity. However, the mechanism of the protective effect of NaB against RILI has not yet been clarified. This study aimed to explore the underlying protective mechanisms of NaB against RILI in NSCLC through network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The predictive target genes of NaB were obtained from the PharmMapper database and the literature review. The involved genes of RILI and NSCLC were predicted using OMIM and GeneCards database. The intersectional genes of drug and disease were identified using the Venny tool and uploaded to the Cytoscape software to identify 5 core target genes of NaB associated with RILI. The correlations between the 5 core target genes and EGFR, PD-L1, immune infiltrates, chemokines and chemokine receptors were analyzed using TIMER 2.0, TIMER and TISIDB databases. We constructed the mechanism maps of the 3 key signaling pathways using the KEGG database based on the results of GO and KEGG analyses from Metascape database. The 5 core target genes and drug were docked using the AutoDock Vina tool and visualized using PyMOL software. GROMACS software was used to perform 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation. Irradiation-induced lung injury model in mice were established to assess the therapeutic effects of NaB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 51 intersectional genes involved in NaB against RILI in NSCLC were identified. The 5 core target genes were AKT1, TP53, NOTCH1, SIRT1, and PTEN. The expressions of the 5 core target genes were significantly associated with EGFR, PD-L1, immune infiltrates, chemokines and chemokine receptors, respectively. The results from GO analysis of the 51 intersectional genes revealed that the biological processes were focused on the regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, oxidative stress and cell death, while the three key KEGG pathways were enriched in PI3K-Akt signal pathway, p53 signal pathway, and FOXO signal pathway. The docking of NaB with the 5 core target genes showed affinity and stability, especially AKT1. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments showed that NaB treatment significantly protected mice from RILI, with reduced lung histological damage. In addition, NaB treatment significantly inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; NaB may protect patients from RILI in NSCLC through multiple target genes including AKT1, TP53, NOTCH1, SIRT1 and PTEN, with multiple signaling pathways involving, including PI3K-Akt pathway, p53 pathway, and FOXO pathways. Our findings effectively provide a feasible theoretical basis to further elucidate the mechanism of NaB in the treatment of RILI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SM22Î± cell-specific HIF stabilization mitigates hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35762602/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though survival rates for preterm infants are improving, the incidence of chronic lung disease of infancy, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), remains high. Histologically, BPD is characterized by larger and fewer alveoli. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) may be protective in the context of hyperoxia-induced lung injury, but the cell-specific effects of HIF expression in neonatal lung injury remain unknown. Thus, we sought to determine whether HIF stabilization in SM22Î±-expressing cells can limit hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury. We generated SM22Î±-specific HIF-1Î±-stabilized mice (&lt;em&gt;SM22Î±-PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice) by cross-breeding SM22Î±-promotor-driven Cre recombinase mice with prolyl hydroxylase &lt;em&gt;PHD1&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PHD2&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Neonatal mice were randomized to 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (normoxia) or 80% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (hyperoxia) exposure for 14 days. For the hyperoxia recovery studies, neonatal mice were recovered from normoxia for an additional 10 wk. SM22Î±-specific HIF-1Î± stabilization mitigated hyperoxia-induced lung injury and preserved microvessel density compared with control mice for both neonates and adults. In &lt;em&gt;SM22Î±-PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) were more proliferative and pulmonary arteries expressed more collagen IV compared with control mice, even under hyperoxic conditions. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) mRNA expression in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) was greater in &lt;em&gt;SM22Î±-PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; compared with control mice in both normoxia and hyperoxia. Pulmonary endothelial cells (PECs) cocultured with PASMC isolated from &lt;em&gt;SM22Î±-PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice formed more tubes and branches with greater tube length compared with PEC cocultured with PASMC isolated from &lt;em&gt;SM22Î±-PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice. Addition of Ang2 recombinant protein further augmented tube formation for both &lt;em&gt;PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PHD1/2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; PASMC. Cell-specific deletion of PHD1 and 2 selectively increases HIF-1Î± expression in SM22Î±-expressing cells and protects neonatal lung development despite prolonged hyperoxia exposure. HIF stabilization in SM22Î±-expressing cells preserved endothelial cell proliferation, microvascular density, increased angiopoietin-2 expression, and lung structure, suggesting a role for cell-specific HIF-1Î± stabilization to prevent neonatal lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The down-regulation of XBP1, an unfolded protein response effector, promotes acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease transition</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35765067/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35765067/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is closely linked to the pathogenesis of renal injuries. However, the role of XBP1, a crucial regulator of adaptive UPR, remains unclear during the transition from acute kidney injury (AKI) to chronic kidney disease (CKD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We characterized XBP1 expressions in different mouse models of kidney injuries, including unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (UIRI), unilateral ureteral obstruction, and adenine-induced CKD, followed by generating proximal tubular XBP1 conditional knockout (XBP1&lt;sup&gt;cKO&lt;/sup&gt;) mice for examining the influences of XBP1. Human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) were silenced of XBP1 to conduct proteomic analysis and investigate the underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We showed a tripartite activation of UPR in injured kidneys. XBP1 expressions were attenuated after AKI and inversely correlated with the severity of post-AKI renal fibrosis. XBP1&lt;sup&gt;cKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited more severe renal fibrosis in the UIRI model than wide-type littermates. Silencing XBP1 induced HK-2 cell cycle arrest in G2M phase, inhibited cell proliferation, and promoted TGF-Î²1 secretion. Proteomic analysis identified TNF receptor associated protein 1 (Trap1) as the potential downstream target transcriptionally regulated by XBP1s. Trap1 overexpression can alleviate silencing XBP1 induced profibrotic factor expressions and cell cycle arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The loss of XBP1 in kidney injury was profibrotic, and the process was mediated by autocrine and paracrine regulations in combination. The present study identified the XBP1-Trap1 axis as an instrumental mechanism responsible for post-AKI fibrosis, which is a novel regulatory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhalation of Salvianolic Acid B Prevents Fine Particulate Matter-Induced Acute Airway Inflammation and Oxidative Stress by Downregulating the LTR4/MyD88/NLRP3 Pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35795853/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is a serious threat to human health. Inhaled fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can cause inflammation and oxidative stress in the airway; however, the mechanisms responsible for this effect have yet to be elucidated and there are no specific drugs that can prevent and treat this condition. In the present study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms underlying the inhalation of salvianolic acid B (SalB) on PM2.5-induced airway inflammation and oxidative stress. We used a PM2.5-induced mouse model of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, along with a human epithelial cell model, to study the action and mechanisms of SalB by histopathology, real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, flow cytometry, and western blotting. SalB treatment markedly inhibited the PM2.5-induced increase in the number of neutrophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, improved the infiltration of inflammatory cells in lung tissue, and reduced injury in the alveolar septum. Furthermore, SalB reduced the mRNA and protein levels of interleukin- (IL-) 1Î², tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) Î±, keratinocyte (KC), and transforming growth factor- (TGF-) Î²1 in lung tissues and the protein levels of IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, IL-8, IL-6, and TGF-Î²1 in human epithelial cells. SalB treatment also significantly prevented the reduction of levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase in lung tissue and reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species in human epithelial cells induced by PM2.5. Furthermore, SalB and the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) inhibitor ST2825 inhibited the expression levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), MyD88, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF-6), and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), as well as the phosphorylation of downstream Erk1/2 and P38 in lung tissue and epithelial cells. SalB protects against PM2.5-induced airway inflammation and oxidative stress in a manner that is associated with the inhibition of the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF-6/NLRP3 pathway and downstream signals ERK1/2 and P38.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microvesicles Derived from Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Enhance Alveolar Type II Cell Proliferation and Attenuate Lung Inflammation in a Rat Model of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35795773/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is known that exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) alleviate hyperoxic lung injury of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in animal models, the role of microvesicles (MVs) derived from hUCMSCs in BPD is poorly defined. Furthermore, antenatal inflammation has been linked to high risk of BPD in preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to explore whether MVs derived from hUCMSCs can preserve lung structure and function in an antenatal lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced BPD rat model and to clarify the underlying mechanism. We demonstrate that antenatal LPS induced alveolar simplification, altered lung function, and dysregulated pulmonary vasculature, which restored by hUCMSCs and MVs treatment. Furthermore, MVs were large vesicles with a diameter of 100-900 nanometers and mostly uptaken by alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2) and macrophages. Compared with the LPS-exposed group, MVs restored the AT2 cell number and SP-C expression in vivo and promoted the proliferation of AT2 cells in vitro. MVs also restored the level of IL-6 and IL-10 in lung homogenate. Additionally, PTEN/AKT and MAPK pathways were associated with the protection of MVs. Taken together, this study suggests MVs derived from hUCMSCs improve lung architecture and function in an antenatal LPS-induced BPD rat model by promoting AT2 cell proliferation and attenuating lung inflammation; thus, MVs provide a promising therapeutic vehicle for BPD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The protective effects of Mai-Luo-Ning injection against LPS-induced acute lung injury via the TLR4/NF-ÎºB signalling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35793597/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe inflammatory disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Various therapeutic strategies for ALI have been proposed over the last few decades; however, the treatment options remain limited. Mai-Luo-Ning injection (MLN), a traditional Chinese medical formulation, has been extensively used for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Nevertheless, the effects of MLN on ALI remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; This study aimed to investigate the protective and therapeutic effects of MLN on lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI mouse models and RAW 264.7 cells, and further explore the underlying mechanism of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The therapeutic activity of MLN was evaluated using an &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; ALI model and an in vitro model of RAW 264.7 macrophages. UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS was used to investigate the chemical constituents of the MLN. The material basis and potential protective mechanism of MLN were analyzed using network pharmacology. The roles of MLN in inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/ nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) signalling pathway were investigated via western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments demonstrated that MLN ameliorated LPS-induced histological changes in lung tissues and reduced lung wet/dry weight ratio, total protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and myeloperoxidase activity. Furthermore, MLN downregulated the &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and in vitro expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1Î². Network pharmacology analysis revealed that MLN could act synergistically through multiple targets and pathways and exert a protective effect, possibly through inhibiting TLR4/ NF-ÎºB signalling pathways. Western blotting and immunofluorescence experiments further confirmed that MLN could regulate the expression of TLR4, MyD88, phospho-IÎºB-Î±, and phospho-NF-ÎºB p65 in the TLR4/NF-ÎºB signalling pathway and decrease the translocation of phospho-NF-ÎºB p65 into the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; This study suggests that MLN has a potential protective effect against LPS-induced ALI, which might be associated with the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-ÎºB signalling pathway. Therefore, MLN is worthy of further investigation as a potential candidate for the treatment of ALI in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expression of DEL-1 in alveolar epithelial cells is repressed in ALI mice;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEL-1 inhibits LPS-induced lung injury in mice;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEL-1 prevents eosinophil recruitment in LPS-induced mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infection is a major cause of acute lung injury (ALI). Developmental endothelial locus-1 (DEL-1) is an immunomodulatory mediator secreted by the endothelial cells. This study aimed to investigate the role of DEL-1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mouse models and its ability to regulate on eosinophil recruitment. Male C57BL/6 mice were administered an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated DEL-1 overexpression vector via intratracheal injection. Twenty-one days after vector instillation, mice were challenged with LPS (5 mg/kg body weight). Lung injury was evaluated using haematoxylin-eosin staining, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbnent assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses. DEL-1 was expressed in alveolar epithelial cells of mice. Compared with that in the control group, DEL-1 was expressed at low levels in the lungs of LPS-challenged mice. LPS injured the lungs in mice, as evidenced by an increase in alveolar wall thickness, inflammatory cell infiltration in the stroma, and alveolar collapse. AAV-mediated DEL-1 overexpression attenuated LPS-induced lung injury and inhibited the release of TNF-Î±, IL-6, and IL-1Î². DEL-1 overexpression also attenuated LPS-induced oxidative stress by decreasing lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activities and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In addition, DEL-1 prevented eosinophil recruitment into lung tissues and inhibited eotaxin production. This study revealed the beneficial role of DEL-1 in preventing LPS-induced ALI in mice. Therefore, DEL-1 can protect lung tissues against LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and eosinophil recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insulin-incubated palladium clusters promote recovery after brain injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a cause of disability and death worldwide, but there are currently no specific treatments for this condition. Release of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the injured brain leads to a series of pathological changes; thus, eliminating ROS could be a potential therapeutic strategy. Herein, we synthesized insulin-incubated ultrasmall palladium (Pd@insulin) clusters via green biomimetic chemistry. The Pd@insulin clusters, which were 3.2 nm in diameter, exhibited marked multiple ROS-scavenging ability testified by the theoretical calculation. Pd@insulin could be rapidly excreted via kidney-urine metabolism and induce negligible adverse effects after a long-time treatment in vivo. In a TBI mouse model, intravenously injected Pd@insulin clusters aggregated in the injured cortex, effectively suppressed excessive ROS production, and significantly rescued motor function, cognition and spatial memory. We found that the positive therapeutic effects of the Pd@insulin clusters were mainly attributed to their ROS-scavenging ability, as they inhibited excessive neuroinflammation, reduced cell apoptosis, and prevented neuronal loss. Therefore, the ability of Pd@insulin clusters to effectively eliminate ROS, as well as their simple structure, easy synthesis, low toxicity, and rapid metabolism may facilitate their clinical translation for TBI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ISM1 suppresses LPS-induced acute lung injury and post-injury lung fibrosis in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35752760/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) are clinical syndromes characterized by acute lung inflammation, pulmonary edema and hypoxemia, with up to 50% mortality rate without effective pharmacological therapy. Following the acute inflammation, repair and remodeling occurs which in some cases resulting in lung fibrosis. The pathophysiology of ALI/ARDS remains incompletely understood. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice have been widely used as a model to study human ALI/ARDS. Isthmin 1 (ISM1) is a secreted protein highly abundant in mouse lung. We have previously reported that upon intratracheal LPS instillation, ISM1 expression in the lung is further upregulated. Recently, we also reported that ISM1 is an anti-inflammatory protein in the lung with &lt;em&gt;Ism1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice presenting spontaneous chronic low-grade lung inflammation and obvious emphysema at young adult stage. However, what role ISM1 plays in ALI/ARDS and lung fibrosis remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Using &lt;em&gt;Ism1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice and intratracheal LPS-induced ALI, and local delivery of recombinant ISM1 (rISM1), we investigated the role ISM1 plays in ALI and post-ALI lung fibrosis using flow cytometry, Western blot, antibody array, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescent and other histological staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; We reveal that ISM1 deficiency in mice led to an intensified acute lung inflammation upon intratracheal LPS challenge, with a heightened leukocyte infiltration including neutrophils and monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages, as well as upregulation of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines including tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±). Although innate immune cells largely subsided to the baseline by day 7 post-LPS challenge in both wild-type and &lt;em&gt;Ism1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, &lt;em&gt;Ism1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lung showed increased post-ALI fibrosis from day 9 post-LPS treatment with increased myofibroblasts, excessive collagen accumulation and TGF-Î² upregulation. The heightened lung fibrosis remained on day 28 post-LPS. Moreover, intranasal delivered recombinant ISM1 (rISM1) effectively suppressed LPS-induced acute lung inflammation and ALI, and rISM1 suppressed LPS-induced NF-ÎºB activation in cultured mouse alveolar macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Together with our previous report, this work further established ISM1 as an endogenous anti-inflammation protein in the lung, restraining excessive host inflammatory response to LPS-triggered ALI and suppressing post-ALI lung fibrosis likely through suppressing NF-ÎºB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a distinct type of programmed cell death (PCD) that depends on iron and is characterized by the accumulation of intracellular iron, exhaustion of glutathione, deactivation of glutathione peroxidase, and promotion of lipid peroxidation. Recently, accumulated investigations have demonstrated that ferroptosis is strongly correlated with the initiation and development of many lung diseases. In this review, we summarized the contribution of ferroptosis to the pathologic process of lung diseases, namely, obstructive lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cystic fibrosis), interstitial lung diseases (pulmonary fibrosis of different causes), pulmonary diseases of vascular origin (ischemia-reperfusion injury and pulmonary hypertension), pulmonary infections (bacteria, viruses, and fungi), acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and lung cancer. We also discussed the therapeutic potential of targeting ferroptosis for these lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Palmatine alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via interfering the interaction of TAK1 and TAB1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe clinical disease marked by uncontrolled inflammation response which lacks effective medicines. Accumulative evidence has indicated that macrophages are therapeutic targets for treating ALI because of its critical role in the inflammatory response.Palmatine (PAL), an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from natural plants, exhibits effective anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-oxidation activities. Here we reported that PAL alleviated LPS-induced acute lung injury and attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration especially neutrophils. Moreover, PAL also attenuated the production of TNF-Î±, CXCL-1, CXCL-2 and nitric oxide in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In addition, PAL remarkably reduced LPS-induced expression of TNF-Î±, CXCL-1 and CXCL-2 in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) and alveolar macrophages (AMs). Treatment with PAL inhibited the phosphorylation and interaction of TAK1/TAB1, which in turn attenuated the p38 MAPK and NF-ÎºB signal pathways in BMDMs. Our results indicated that PAL ameliorated LPS-induced ALI by inhibiting macrophage activation through inhibiting NF-ÎºB and p38 MAPK pathways, suggesting that PAL has anti-inflammation effect on ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updated Views on Neutrophil Responses in IschemiaâReperfusion Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion injury is an inevitable event during organ transplantation and represents a primary risk factor for the development of early graft dysfunction in lung, heart, liver, and kidney transplant recipients. Recent studies have implicated recipient neutrophils as key mediators of this process and also have found that early innate immune responses after transplantation can ultimately augment adaptive alloimmunity and affect late graft outcomes. Here, we discuss signaling pathways involved in neutrophil recruitment and activation after ischemia-mediated graft injury in solid organ transplantation with an emphasis on lung allografts, which have been the focus of recent studies. These findings suggest novel therapeutic interventions that target ischemia-reperfusion injury-mediated graft dysfunction in transplant recipients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yu-Ping-Feng Formula Ameliorates Alveolar-Capillary Barrier Injury Induced by Exhausted-Exercise via Regulation of Cytoskeleton</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35814249/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Yu-ping-feng powder (YPF) is a compound traditional Chinese medicine extensively used in China for respiratory diseases. However, the role of YPF in alveolar-capillary barrier dysfunction remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the effect and potential mechanism of YPF on alveolar-capillary barrier injury induced by exhausted exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish an exhausted-exercise model by using a motorized rodent treadmill. YPF at doses of 2.18 g/kg was administrated by gavage before exercise training for 10 consecutive days. Food intake-weight/body weight, blood gas analysis, lung water percent content, BALF protein concentration, morphological observation, quantitative proteomics, real-time PCR, and Western blot were performed. A rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell line (PMVEC) subjected to hypoxia was applied for assessing the related mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; YPF attenuated the decrease of food intake weight/body weight, improved lung swelling and hemorrhage, alleviated the increase of lung water percent content and BALF protein concentration, and inhibited the impairment of lung morphology. In addition, YPF increased the expression of claudin 3, claudin 18, occludin, VE-cadherin, and Î²-catenin, attenuated the epithelial and endothelial hyperpermeability in vivo and/or in vitro, and the stress fiber formation in PMVECs after hypoxia. Quantitative proteomics discovered that the effect of YPF implicated the Siah2-ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway, Gng12-PAK1-MLCK, and RhoA/ROCK, which was further confirmed by Western blot. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD032737.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; YPF ameliorated alveolar-capillary barrier injury induced by exhausted exercise, which is accounted for at least partly by the regulation of cytoskeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Farnesoid X receptor protects against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury by regulating the transcription of ferroptosis-related genes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35767918/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side effects of cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, include nephrotoxicity. Previous studies have reported that cisplatin induces ferroptosis and lipid peroxide accumulation. Ferroptosis, a type of regulated cell death, is characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Although previous studies have examined the regulation of ferroptosis in acute kidney injury (AKI), the regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis has not been elucidated. Here, the ability of activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) to attenuate cisplatin-induced AKI through the regulation of ferroptosis was examined. FXR deficiency exhibited more ferroptosis responses, such as increase in lipid peroxidation, iron content and heme oxygenase 1 protein, and a decrease in glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio and glutathione peroxidase 4 levels in HK2 cells and mice. Increased blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and ferroptotic responses in the cisplatin-induced AKI mouse model were mitigated upon treatment with the FXR agonist GW4064 but were exacerbated in FXR knockout mice. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that ferroptosis-associated genes were novel targets of FXR. FXR agonist upregulated the expression of lipid and glutathione metabolism-related genes and downregulated cell death-related genes. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, using mice renal tissues, revealed that agonist-activated FXR could bind to its known target genes (Slc51a, Slc51b, Osgin1, and Mafg) and ferroptosis-related genes (Aifm2, Ggt6, and Gsta4). Furthermore, activated FXR-dependent MAFG, a transcriptional repressor, could bind to Hmox1, Nqo1, and Tf in the renal tissues of FXR agonist-treated mice. These findings indicate that activated FXR regulates the transcription of ferroptosis-related genes and protects against cisplatin-induced AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of polycomb repressive complex 2 by targeting EED protects against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35734954/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a multicomponent complex with methyltransferase activity that catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Interaction of the epigenetic reader protein EED with EZH2, a catalytic unit of PRC, allosterically stimulates PRC2 activity. In this study, we investigated the role and underlying mechanism of the PRC2 in acute kidney injury (AKI) by using EED226, a highly selective PRC2 inhibitor, to target EED. Administration of EED226 improved renal function, attenuated renal pathological changes, and reduced renal tubular cell apoptosis in a murine model of cisplatin-induced AKI. In cultured renal epithelial cells, treatment with either EED226 or EED siRNA also ameliorated cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, EED226 treatment inhibited cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of p53 and FOXO3a, two transcriptional factors contributing to apoptosis, and preserved expression of Sirtuin 3 and PGC1Î±, two proteins associated with mitochondrial protection in vivo and in vitro. EED226 was also effective in enhancing renal tubular cell proliferation, suppressing expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines, and reducing infiltration of macrophages to the injured kidney. These data suggest that inhibition of the PRC2 activity by targeting EED can protect against cisplatin-induced AKI by promoting the survival and proliferation of renal tubular cells and inhibiting inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 promotes acute kidney injury by alleviating poly ADP ribose polymerase 1 degradation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35752325/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel biomarker, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), is used clinically to predict different types of acute kidney injury (AKI) and has drawn significant attention as a urinary biomarker. However, as a secreted protein in the circulation of patients with AKI, it is unclear whether IGFBP7 acts as a key regulator in AKI progression, and if mechanisms underlying its upregulation still need to be determined. Here we found that IGFBP7 is highly expressed in the blood and urine of patients and mice with AKI, possibly via a c-Jun-dependent mechanism, and is positively correlated with kidney dysfunction. Global knockout of IGFBP7 ameliorated kidney dysfunction, inflammatory responses, and programmed cell death in murine models of cisplatin-, kidney ischemia/reperfusion-, and lipopolysaccharide-induced AKI. IGFBP7 mainly originated from kidney tubular epithelial cells. Conditional knockout of IGFBP7 from the kidney protected against AKI. By contrast, rescue of IGFBP7 expression in IGFBP7-knockout mice restored kidney damage and inflammation. IGFBP7 function was determined in vitro using recombinant IGFBP7 protein, IGFBP7 knockdown, or overexpression. Additionally, IGFBP7 was found to bind to poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) and inhibit its degradation by antagonizing the E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 4 (RNF4). Thus, IGFBP7 in circulation acts as a biomarker and key mediator of AKI by inhibiting RNF4/PARP1-mediated tubular injury and inflammation. Hence, over-activation of the IGFBP7/PARP1 axis represents a promising target for AKI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liquiritigenin protects against myocardial ischemic by inhibiting oxidative stress, apoptosis, and L-type Ca2&#43; channels</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquiritigenin (Lq) offers cytoprotective effects against various cardiac injuries, but its beneficial effects on myocardial ischemic (MI) injury and the related mechanisms remain unclear. In the in vivo study, an animal model of MI was induced by intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol (Iso, 85 mg/kg). ECG, heart rate, serum levels of CK and CK-MB, histopathological changes, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were all measured. In vitro, H9c2 cells were divided into four groups and treated for 24 hr with liquiritigenin (30 Î¼mol/L and 100 Î¼mol/L) followed with CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (800 Î¼mol/L) for another 24 hr. Cell viability, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) were then assessed. The L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current (I&lt;sub&gt;Ca-L&lt;/sub&gt;) was detected using a patch clamp technique on isolated rat ventricular myocytes. The myocyte contraction and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients were measured using an IonOptix detection system. The remarkable cardiac injury and generation of intracellular ROS induced by Iso were alleviated via treatment with Lq. CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; administration induced cell apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload in H9c2; Lq reduces these deleterious effects of CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Meanwhile, Lq blocked I&lt;sub&gt;Ca-L&lt;/sub&gt; in a dose-dependent manner. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of Lq was 110.87 Î¼mol/L. Lq reversibly reduced the amplitude of cell contraction as well as the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. The results show that Lq protects against MI injury by antioxidation, antiapoptosis, counteraction mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibition of I&lt;sub&gt;Ca-L&lt;/sub&gt;, thus damping intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cardiac Spinal Afferent Denervation Attenuates Renal Dysfunction in Rats With Cardiorenal Syndrome Type 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epicardial application of RTX at the time of MI largely prevented renal dysfunction, attenuated renal congestion, and partially restored renal blood flow in rats with CHF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RNA sequencing analysis showed that renal injury, inflammation, hypoxia, and apoptosis genes were significantly up-regulated in the renal tissue of CHF rats, which was largely prevented by epicardial RTX at the time of MI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cardiac afferent ablation by intraâstellate ganglia injection of RTX or unilateral renal denervation 4 weeks after MI had similar renal protective effects on renal tubular damage in CHF rats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These data provide evidence for cardiac spinal afferent modulation of renal function and a potential targeted therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiorenal syndrome type 2 (CRS2) is defined as a chronic cardiovascular disease, usually chronic heart failure (CHF), resulting in chronic kidney disease. We hypothesized that the cardiac spinal afferent reflex (CSAR) plays a critical role in the development of CRS2. Our data suggest that cardiac afferent ablation by resiniferatoxin not only improves cardiac function but also benefits the kidneys and increases long-term survival in the myocardial infarction model of CHF. We also found that renal denervation has a similar reno-protective effect in CHF rats. We believe this novel work contributes to the development of a unique neuromodulation therapy to treat CHF patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The gut-lung axis in severe acute Pancreatitis-associated lung injury: The protection by the gut microbiota through short-chain fatty acids</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35752356/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of gut microbiota in regulating the intestinal homeostasis, as well as the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury (PALI) is widely recognized. The bioactive functions of metabolites with small molecule weight and the detail molecular mechanisms of PALI mediated by &amp;ldquo;gut-lung axis&amp;rdquo; have gradually raised the attentions of researchers. Several studies have proved that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbiome play crucial roles and varied activities in the process of PALI. However, relevant reviews reporting SCFAs in the involvement of PALI is lacking. In this review, we firstly introduced the synthetic and metabolic pathways of SCFAs, as well as the transport and signal transduction routes in brief. Afterwards, we focused on the possible mechanisms and clues of SCFAs to participate in the fight against PALI which referred to the inhibition of pathogen proliferation, anti-inflammatory effects, enhancement of intestinal barrier functions, and the maintenance and regulation of immune homeostasis via pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In addition, the latest reported pathological and physiological mechanisms of the gut-lung axis involved in PALI were reviewed. Finally, we summarized the potential therapeutic interventions of PALI by targeting SCFAs, including dietary fiber supplementation, direct supplementation of SCFAs/prebiotics/probiotics, and drugs administration, which is expected to provide new sights for clinical use in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypomagnesemia, Hypocalcemia, and Tubulointerstitial Nephropathy Caused by Claudin-16 Autoantibodies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35728884/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic hypomagnesemia is commonly due to diarrhea, alcoholism, and drugs. More rarely, it is caused by genetic defects in the effectors of renal magnesium reabsorption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; In an adult patient with acquired severe hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, tubulointerstitial nephropathy, and rapidly progressing kidney injury, similarities between the patient&amp;rsquo;s presentation and features of genetic disorders of renal magnesium transport prompted us to investigate whether the patient had an acquired autoimmune cause of renal magnesium wasting. To determine if the patient&amp;rsquo;s condition might be explained by autoantibodies directed against claudin-16 or claudin-19, transmembrane paracellular proteins involved in renal magnesium absorption, we conducted experiments with claudin knockout mice and transfected mouse kidney cells expressing human claudin-16 or claudin-19. We also examined effects on renal magnesium handling in rats given intravenous injections of IgG purified from sera from the patient or controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Experiments with the knockout mice and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; transfected cells demonstrated that hypomagnesemia in the patient was causally linked to autoantibodies directed against claudin-16, which controls paracellular magnesium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle&amp;rsquo;s loop. Intravenous injection of IgG purified from the patient&amp;rsquo;s serum induced a marked urinary waste of magnesium in rats. Immunosuppressive treatment combining plasma exchange and rituximab was associated with improvement in the patient&amp;rsquo;s GFR, but hypomagnesemia persisted. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with a renal carcinoma that expressed a high level of claudin-16 mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Pathogenic claudin-16 autoantibodies represent a novel autoimmune cause of specific renal tubular transport disturbances and tubulointerstitial nephropathy. Screening for autoantibodies targeting claudin-16, and potentially other magnesium transporters or channels in the kidney, may be warranted in patients with acquired unexplained hypomagnesemia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 conferred potent protection against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 inhibited M1 macrophage polarization, limiting its pro-inflammatory activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACT001 suppressed NF-ÎºB and STAT1 signaling by targeting IKKÎ² as well as STAT1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACT001 has been shown to exhibit excellent antitumor and anti-fibrosis activities. However, the role of ACT001 in acute lung injury (ALI) and the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of ACT001 on ALI and explore the potential mechanisms. Herein, we firstly established the ALI mouse model induced by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ACT001 treatment significantly alleviated histopathological changes of lung tissues with lower infiltration of pulmonary M1 macrophages in ALI mice. Then, we performed in vitro experiment and found that ACT001 treatment effectively inhibited the M1 phenotype of RAW264.7 and THP-1.. Next, we performed pull-down and mass spectrometry analysis to screen the interacting proteins of ACT001, identifying IKKÎ² and STAT1 as the critical target proteins of ACT001. And ACT001 treatment significantly suppressed the NF-ÎºB and STAT1 pathways, thereby inhibiting the M1 polarization against inflammation in vivo and in vitro. Finally, we used IMD 0354 (IMD) and Fludarabine (Flud) to specifically block the activity of IKKÎ² and STAT1, and stimulated macrophages through IKKÎ² and STAT1 overexpression. Our data clearly showed that ACT001-induced decrease of the M1 polarization was blocked by IMD and Flud treatment, and reversed by IKKÎ² and STAT1 overexpression in RAW264.7 cells. In conclusion, we discovered that ACT001 significantly alleviates inflammation and limits M1 phenotype of pulmonary macrophages via suppressing NF-ÎºB and STAT1 signaling pathways, providing new insights for the development of drugs to treat ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ROS-responsive polymer nanoparticles with enhanced loading of dexamethasone effectively modulate the lung injury microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35724918/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disorder associated with cytokine storm, which activates various reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathways and causes severe complications in patients as currently seen in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is an urgent need for medication of the inflammatory lung environment and effective delivery of drugs to lung to reduce the burden of high doses of medications and attenuate inflammatory cells and pathways. Herein, we prepared dexamethasone-loaded ROS-responsive polymer nanoparticles (PFTU@DEX NPs) by a modified emulsion approach, which achieved high loading content of DEX (11.61 %). DEX was released faster from the PFTU@DEX NPs in a ROS environment, which could scavenge excessive ROS efficiently both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. The PFTU NPs and PFTU@DEX NPs showed no hemolysis and cytotoxicity. Free DEX, PFTU NPs and PFTU@DEX NPs shifted M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages in RAW264.7 cells, and showed anti-inflammatory modulation to A549 cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. The PFTU@DEX NPs treatment significantly reduced the increased total protein concentration in BALF of ALI mice. The delivery of PFTU@DEX NPs decreased the proportion of neutrophils significantly, mitigated the cell apoptosis remarkably compared to the other groups, reduced M1 macrophages and increased M2 macrophages &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Moreover, the PFTU@DEX NPs had the strongest ability to suppress the expression of NLRP3, Caspase1, and IL-1Î². Therefore, the PFTU@DEX NPs could efficiently suppress inflammatory cells, ROS signaling pathways, and cell apoptosis to ameliorate LPS-induced ALI. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disorder associated with cytokine storm, which activates various reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathways and causes severe complications in patients. There is an urgent need for medication of the inflammatory lung environment and effective delivery of drugs to modulate the inflammatory disorder and suppress the expression of ROS and inflammatory cytokines. The inhaled PFTU@DEX NPs prepared through a modified nanoemulsification method suppressed the activation of NLRP3, induced the polarization of macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2, and thereby reduced the neutrophil infiltration, inhibited the release of proteins and inflammatory mediators, and thus decreased the acute lung injury &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High phosphate-induced progressive proximal tubular injury is associated with the activation of Stat3/Kim-1 signaling pathway and macrophage recruitment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35713543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary phosphate intake in the Western population greatly exceeds the recommended dietary allowance and is linked to enhanced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It is unclear whether a chronic high phosphate diet (HPD) causes kidney injury in healthy individuals. Here, we show that feeding a 2% HPD in C57BL/6N mice for one up to six months resulted in hyperphosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia, increased plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) compared to mice on a 0.8% phosphate diet. Kidney injury was already noted after two months of HPD characterized by loss of proximal tubular (PT) cell polarity, flattened epithelia, disruption of brush border membranes, vacuolization, increased PT cell proliferation, marked interstitial mononuclear infiltration, and progressive accumulation of collagen fibers. HPD increased Stat3 activation and Kim-1 expression in PT epithelial cells and enhanced renal synthesis of chemokines recruiting monocytes and macrophages as well as macrophage related factors. Enhanced recruitment of F4/80+ macrophages around injured PT lesions was timely associated with increased Kim-1 synthesis, tubular MCP-1 expression, and degree of PT injury score. Likewise, tubulointerstitial fibrosis was associated with activation of Stat3/Kim-1 signaling pathway. The stimulation of human proximal tubular cells with high phosphate activated Stat3 signaling and induced HAVCR1 and CCL2 expression. We conclude that high phosphate results in progressive proximal tubular injury, indicating that high dietary phosphate intake may affect kidney health and therefore represents an underestimated health problem for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podocyte injury is a hallmark of glomerular diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. B7-1 is increased in injured podocytes, but its intrinsic role is controversial. The clinical data here revealed the intimate correlation of urinary B7-1 with severity of glomerular injury. Through transcriptomic and biological assays in B7-1 transgenic and adriamycin nephropathy models, we identified B7-1 is a key mediator in podocyte injury and glomerulosclerosis through a series of signal transmission to Î²-catenin. Using LC-MS/MS, Hsp90ab1, a conserved molecular chaperone, was distinguished to be an anchor for transmitting signals from B7-1 to Î²-catenin. Molecular docking and subsequent mutant analysis further identified the residue K69 in the N terminal domain of Hsp90ab1 was the key binding site for B7-1 to activate LRP5/Î²-catenin pathway. The interaction and biological functions of B7-1-Hsp90ab1-LRP5 complex were further demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. We also found B7-1 is a novel downstream target of Î²-catenin. Our results indicate an intercrossed network of B7-1, which collectively induces podocyte injury and glomerulosclerosis. Our study provides an important clue to improve the therapeutic strategies to target B7-1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is one of the critical risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanisms for transition from colitis to CRC remain elusive. Recently, epigenetic changes have emerged as important regulatory factors for colitis-associated cancer. Here, a systematic epigenomic study of histone modifications is performed, including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, in an AOM-DSS-induced CRC mouse model. In combination with transcriptomic data, the authors generate a dataset of 105 deep sequencing files and illustrate the dynamic landscape of chromatin states at five time points during inflammation-cancer transition. Functional gene clusters are identified based on dynamic transcriptomic and epigenomic information, and key signaling pathways in the process are illustrated. This study&amp;rsquo;s results reveal that enhancer state regions play important roles during inflammation-cancer transition. It predicts novel transcription factors based on enhancer information, and experimentally proves OTX2 as a critical tumor suppressive transcription factor. Taken together, this study provides comprehensive epigenomic data and reveals novel molecular mechanisms for colitis-associated cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reflects kidney function. Progressive eGFR-decline can lead to kidney failure, necessitating dialysis or transplantation. Hundreds of loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for eGFR help explain population cross section variability. Since the contribution of these or other loci to eGFR-decline remains largely unknown, we derived GWAS for annual eGFR-decline and meta-analyzed 62 longitudinal studies with eGFR assessed twice over time in all 343,339 individuals and in high-risk groups. We also explored different covariate adjustment. Twelve genome-wide significant independent variants for eGFR-decline unadjusted or adjusted for eGFR-baseline (11 novel, one known for this phenotype), including nine variants robustly associated across models were identified. All loci for eGFR-decline were known for cross-sectional eGFR and thus distinguished a subgroup of eGFR loci. Seven of the nine variants showed variant-by-age interaction on eGFR cross section (further about 350,000 individuals), which linked genetic associations for eGFR-decline with age-dependency of genetic cross-section associations. Clinically important were two to four-fold greater genetic effects on eGFR-decline in high-risk subgroups. Five variants associated also with chronic kidney disease progression mapped to genes with functional in-silico evidence (UMOD, SPATA7, GALNTL5, TPPP). An unfavorable versus favorable nine-variant genetic profile showed increased risk odds ratios of 1.35 for kidney failure (95% confidence intervals 1.03-1.77) and 1.27 for acute kidney injury (95% confidence intervals 1.08-1.50) in over 2000 cases each, with matched controls). Thus, we provide a large data resource, genetic loci, and prioritized genes for kidney function decline, which help inform drug development pipelines revealing important insights into the age-dependency of kidney function genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Methyltransferase-like 3 leads to lung injury by up-regulation of interleukin 24 through N6-methyladenosine-dependent mRNA stability and translation efficiency in mice exposed to fine particulate matter 2.5</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-term fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) exposure induces lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 increases the global RNA m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5 alters the expression of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modulators including METTL3 and YTHDF1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YTHDF1 can bind &lt;em&gt;IL24&lt;/em&gt; mRNA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;METTL3 and YTHDF1 regulate the expression of IL24 via m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) exposure leads to the progress of pulmonary disease. It has been reported that N6-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) modification was involved in various biological processes and diseases. However, the critical role of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification in pulmonary disease during PM2.5 exposure remains elusive. Here, we revealed that lung inflammation and mucus production caused by PM2.5 were associated with m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification. Both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; assays demonstrated that PM2.5 exposure elevated the total level of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification as well as the methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) expression. Integration analysis of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A RNA immunoprecipitation-seq (meRIP-seq) and RNA-seq discovered that METTL3 up-regulated the expression level and the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification of Interleukin 24 (IL24). Importantly, we explored that the stability of &lt;em&gt;IL24&lt;/em&gt; mRNA was enhanced due to the increased m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification. Moreover, the data from qRT-PCR showed that PM2.5 also increased &lt;em&gt;YTH&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-Methyladenosine RNA Binding Protein 1&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;YTHDF1&lt;/em&gt;) expression, and the up-regulated YTHDF1 augmented &lt;em&gt;IL24&lt;/em&gt; mRNA translation efficiency. Down-regulation of Mettl3 reduced Il24 expression and ameliorated the pulmonary inflammation and mucus secretion in mice exposed to PM2.5. Taken together, our finding provided a comprehensive insight for revealing the significant role of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A regulators in the lung injury via METTL3/YTHDF1-coupled epitranscriptomal regulation of &lt;em&gt;IL24&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Whole transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed key RNA profiles and toxicity in mice after chronic exposure to microplastics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating the long-term effects of microplastics (MPs) in vivo is necessary for evaluating its biological toxicity. Previously, we showed that MPs elicit vascular dysfunctions in atherosclerotic mice. However, the effects of long-term treatment with environmental levels of MPs on biological functions and RNA expression profiles in wild-type mice are unknown. Here, C57BL/6 mice were administered 1000 Î¼g/L MPs through their drinking water for 180 days. Transcriptomic analyses, biochemical analysis, and histopathological examination were conducted to determine the key signals and molecular mechanisms triggered by MPs in vivo using whole transcriptome sequencing, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and histopathological analysis. Notably, our data revealed that MPs aggravated vascular lesions and organ injuries, particularly liver, kidney, and heart injuries. Additionally, MPs exacerbated oxidative injuries by inhibiting the activities of antioxidant enzymes and increasing the levels of the serum biochemistry indicator of organ damage. RNA sequencing of vascular tissues showed that 674 mRNAs, 39 lncRNAs, 196 miRNAs, and 565 circRNAs were abnormally expressed in MPs-treated mice compared with the untreated group. Pathway enrichment analyses identified pathways linked to the toxicity of MPs, including lysosomal, NOD-like receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathways. Additionally, competing endogenous RNA networks were constructed and hub RNAs were identified using bioinformatics analysis. Taken together, our data suggested that toxicity induced by long-term exposure to MPs continually presents with extensive changes in biological features and global gene expression profiles. Our data provides new insights into the biological toxicity of MPs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening lung injury characterized by an acute inflammatory response in the lung parenchyma. Hence, it is considered as the most appropriate clinical syndrome to study pathogenic mechanisms of lung inflammation. ARDS is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU), while no effective pharmacological treatment exists. It is very important therefore to fully characterize the underlying pathobiology and the related mechanisms, in order to develop novel therapeutic approaches. In vivo and in vitro models are important pre-clinical tools in biological and medical research in the mechanistic and pathological understanding of the majority of diseases. In this review, we will present data from selected experimental models of lung injury/acute lung inflammation, which have been based on clinical disorders that can lead to the development of ARDS and related inflammatory lung processes in humans, including ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI), sepsis, ischemia/reperfusion, smoke, acid aspiration, radiation, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), influenza, &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;S.&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; and coronaviruses infection. Data from the corresponding clinical conditions will also be presented. The mechanisms related to lung inflammation that will be covered are oxidative stress, neutrophil extracellular traps, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, surfactant, and water and ion channels. Finally, we will present a brief overview of emerging techniques in the field of omics research that have been applied to ARDS research, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, which may recognize factors to help stratify ICU patients at risk, predict their prognosis, and possibly, serve as more specific therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STING signaling sensing of DRP1-dependent mtDNA release in kupffer cells contributes to lipopolysaccharide-induced liver injury in mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35724543/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberrant pro-inflammatory activation of Kupffer cells (KCs) is strongly involved in the pathogenesis of septic liver injury. Recent evidence indicates the crucial roles of excessive stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling activation during sepsis. However, the role of STING signaling in septic liver injury remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that STING signaling was markedly activated in KCs isolated from wild type mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. STING deficiency effectively protected liver function, attenuated systemic inflammatory response and decreased mortality in LPS-treated mice, which were aggravated by STING agonist (DMXAA). Importantly, STING signaling activation in KCs contributed to LPS-induced liver injury through promoting hepatocyte death. Mechanistically, STING signaling could be activated by release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) through dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-dependent mitochondrial fission in LPS-treated KCs. Additionally, LPS stimulation enhanced DRP1-dependent mitochondrial ROS production, which promoted the leak of mtDNA into the cytosol and subsequent STING signaling activation in KCs. The in vivo experiments showed that pharmacological inhibition of DRP1 with Mdivi-1 partially prevented the activation of STING signaling in KCs isolated from LPS-challenged mice, as well as alleviated liver injury and inhibited systemic inflammatory response. In summary, our study comprehensively confirmed that STING signaling senses the DRP1-dependent release of mtDNA in KCs and its activation might play a key role in LPS-induced liver injury, which offers new sights and therapeutic targets for management of septic liver injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brevilin A Ameliorates Acute Lung Injury and Inflammation Through Inhibition of NF-ÎºB Signaling via Targeting IKKÎ±/Î²</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35774606/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is life-threatening disease characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory response. IKKÎ±/Î², the key kinases in the activation of NF-ÎºB pathway, are implicated in inflammatory pulmonary injury, and represent attractive targets for ALI therapy. Brevilin A (BVA) is a sesquiterpene lactone from Centipeda minima, a Chinese herb used to treat inflammatory diseases. This study aims to investigate the inhibition of BVA on ALI, with focus on clarifying the molecular mechanisms involved in BVA-mediated anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages. Briefly, BVA significantly inhibited the production of NO and PGE2 by suppressing iNOS and COX2 expression, and suppressed the mRNA expression of IL-1Î², IL-6, and TNFÎ± in LPS/IFNÎ³-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. The anti-inflammatory activity of BVA was further confirmed in LPS/IFNÎ³-stimulated BMDMs and TNFÎ±/IFNÎ³-exposed RAW264.7 cells. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, BVA effectively attenuated LPS-induced lung damage, inflammatory infiltration, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including MPO, IL-1Î², IL-6, TNFÎ±, and PGE2. Mechanistically, BVA could covalently bind to the cysteine 114 of IKKÎ±/Î², and effectively inhibiting the activity and function of IKKÎ±/Î², thereby resulting in the suppression of phosphorylation and degradation of IÎºBÎ± and the subsequent activation of NF-ÎºB signaling. Furthermore, pretreatment of DTT, a thiol ligand donor, significantly abolished BVA-mediated effects in LPS/IFNÎ³-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, suggesting the crucial role of the electrophilic Î±, Î²-unsaturated ketone of BVA on its anti-inflammatory activity. These results suggest that BVA ameliorates ALI through inhibition of NF-ÎºB signaling via covalently targeting IKKÎ±/Î², raising the possibility that BVA could be effective in the treatment of ALI and other diseases harboring aberrant NF-ÎºB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impaired Antibody Response Is Associated with Histone-Release, Organ Dysfunction and Mortality in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; the pathophysiologic mechanisms explaining differences in clinical outcomes following COVID-19 are not completely described. This study aims to investigate antibody responses in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in relation to inflammation, organ failure and 30-day survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; All patients with PCR-verified COVID-19 and gave consent, and who were admitted to a tertiary Intensive care unit (ICU) in Sweden during March-September 2020 were included. Demography, repeated blood samples and measures of organ function were collected. Analyses of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM, IgA and IgG) in plasma were performed and correlated to patient outcome and biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 115 patients (median age 62 years, 77% male) were included prospectively. All patients developed severe respiratory dysfunction, and 59% were treated with invasive ventilation. Thirty-day mortality was 22.6% for all included patients. Patients negative for any anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in plasma during ICU admission had higher 30-day mortality compared to patients positive for antibodies. Patients positive for IgM had more ICU-, ventilator-, renal replacement therapy- and vasoactive medication-free days. IgA antibody concentrations correlated negatively with both SAPS3 and maximal SOFA-score and IgM-levels correlated negatively with SAPS3. Patients with antibody levels below the detection limit had higher plasma levels of extracellular histones on day 1 and elevated levels of kidney and cardiac biomarkers, but showed no signs of increased inflammation, complement activation or cytokine release. After adjusting for age, positive IgM and IgG antibodies were still associated with increased 30-day survival, with odds ratio (OR) 7.1 (1.5-34.4) and 4.2 (1.1-15.7), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In patients with severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care, a poor antibody response is associated with organ failure, systemic histone release and increased 30-day mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal Microbiota - An Unmissable Bridge to Severe Acute Pancreatitis-Associated Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35774796/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), one of the most serious abdominal emergencies in general surgery, is characterized by acute and rapid onset as well as high mortality, which often leads to multiple organ failure (MOF). Acute lung injury (ALI), the earliest accompanied organ dysfunction, is the most common cause of death in patients following the SAP onset. The exact pathogenesis of ALI during SAP, however, remains unclear. In recent years, advances in the microbiota-gut-lung axis have led to a better understanding of SAP-associated lung injury (PALI). In addition, the bidirectional communications between intestinal microbes and the lung are becoming more apparent. This paper aims to review the mechanisms of an imbalanced intestinal microbiota contributing to the development of PALI, which is mediated by the disruption of physical, chemical, and immune barriers in the intestine, promotes bacterial translocation, and results in the activation of abnormal immune responses in severe pancreatitis. The pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) mediated immunol mechanisms in the occurrence of PALI via binding with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) through the microbiota-gut-lung axis are focused in this study. Moreover, the potential therapeutic strategies for alleviating PALI by regulating the composition or the function of the intestinal microbiota are discussed in this review. The aim of this study is to provide new ideas and therapeutic tools for PALI patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RG100204, A Novel Aquaporin-9 Inhibitor, Reduces Septic Cardiomyopathy and Multiple Organ Failure in Murine Sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35774785/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is caused by systemic infection and is a major health concern as it is the primary cause of death from infection. It is the leading cause of mortality worldwide and there are no specific effective treatments for sepsis. Gene deletion of the neutral solute channel Aquaporin 9 (AQP9) normalizes oxidative stress and improves survival in a bacterial endotoxin induced mouse model of sepsis. In this study we described the initial characterization and effects of a novel small molecule AQP9 inhibitor, RG100204, in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) induced model of polymicrobial infection. In vitro, RG100204 blocked mouse AQP9 H2O2 permeability in an ectopic CHO cell expression system and abolished the LPS induced increase in superoxide anion and nitric oxide in FaO hepatoma cells. Pre-treatment of CLP-mice with RG100204 (25 mg/kg p.o. before CLP and then again at 8 h after CLP) attenuated the hypothermia, cardiac dysfunction (systolic and diastolic), renal dysfunction and hepatocellular injury caused by CLP-induced sepsis. Post-treatment of CLP-mice with RG100204 also attenuated the cardiac dysfunction (systolic and diastolic), the renal dysfunction caused by CLP-induced sepsis, but did not significantly reduce the liver injury or hypothermia. The most striking finding was that oral administration of RG100204 as late as 3 h after the onset of polymicrobial sepsis attenuated the cardiac and renal dysfunction caused by severe sepsis. Immunoblot quantification demonstrated that RG100204 reduced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Moreover, myeloperoxidase activity in RG100204 treated lung tissue was reduced. Together these results indicate that AQP9 may be a novel drug target in polymicrobial sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatiotemporal distribution of cellular injury and leukocytes during the progression of ventilator-induced lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supportive mechanical ventilation is a necessary lifesaving treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This intervention often leads to injury exacerbation by ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Patterns of injury in ARDS and VILI are recognized to be heterogeneous; however, quantification of these injury distributions remains incomplete. Developing a more detailed understanding of injury heterogeneity, particularly how it varies in space and time, can help elucidate the mechanisms of VILI pathogenesis. Ultimately, this knowledge can be used to develop protective ventilation strategies that slow disease progression. To expand existing knowledge of VILI heterogeneity, we document the spatial evolution of cellular injury distribution and leukocyte infiltration, on the micro- and macroscales, during protective and injurious mechanical ventilation. We ventilated naÃ¯ve mice using either high inspiratory pressure and zero positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation or low tidal volume with positive end-expiratory pressure. Distributions of cellular injury, identified with propidium iodide staining, were microscopically analyzed at three levels of injury severity. Cellular injury initiated in diffuse, quasi-random patterns, and progressed through expansion of high-density regions of injured cells termed &amp;ldquo;injury clusters.&amp;rdquo; The density profile of the expanding injury regions suggests that stress shielding occurs, protecting the already injured regions from further damage. Spatial distribution of leukocytes did not correlate with that of cellular injury or ventilation-induced changes in lung function. These results suggest that protective ventilation protocols should protect the interface between healthy and injured regions to stymie injury propagation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The circular RNA hsa_circ_0003091 regulates sepsis-induced lung injury by sponging the miR-149/Smad2 axis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe cause of death. Increasing evidence has identified circular RNAs (circRNAs) acting as critical regulators of human diseases. However, their expression pattern and underlying mechanisms in ALI remain unclear. Herein, we screened the circRNAs of ALI patients and constructed a lung injury murine model using lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induction. Functional analyses of targeted circRNA were performed &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Then, the downstream miRNA and mRNA of specific circRNAs were identified. Compared to healthy subjects, 35 circRNAs were upregulated and 9 circRNAs were downregulated in sepsis patients. The top 10 differentially expressed circRNAs were selected for validation and has_circ_0003091 was selected. The ALI mice presented significantly elevated has_circ_0003091 (mmu_circ_0015268). The functional analysis revealed that mmu_circ_0015268 contributed to the pulmonary injury, cell apoptosis, inflammatory responses, and endothelial activation in the ALI murine model. On the other hand, silencing mmu_circ_0015268 showed protective effects in LPS-treated mice and PMVECs. Furthermore, mmu_circ_0015268 sponged miR-149 to upregulate the expression of its target Smad2. In summary, we demonstrated that has_circ_0003091 might be a novel target for the management and treatment of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fatal Circle of NETs and NET-Associated DAMPs Contributing to Organ Dysfunction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens or sterile injuries. Pattern recognition receptors (PRR) sense molecules released from inflamed or damaged cells, or foreign molecules resulting from invading pathogens. PRRs can in turn induce inflammatory responses, comprising the generation of cytokines or chemokines, which further induce immune cell recruitment. Neutrophils represent an essential factor in the early immune response and fulfill numerous tasks to fight infection or heal injuries. The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is part of it and was originally attributed to the capture and elimination of pathogens. In the last decade studies revealed a detrimental role of NETs during several diseases, often correlated with an exaggerated immune response. Overwhelming inflammation in single organs can induce remote organ damage, thereby further perpetuating release of inflammatory molecules. Here, we review recent findings regarding damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which are able to induce NET formation, as well as NET components known to act as DAMPs, generating a putative fatal circle of inflammation contributing to organ damage and sequentially occurring remote organ injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Characterization of the B-Cell Epitopes of Echinococcus granulosus Histones H4 and H2A Recognized by Sera From Patients With Liver Cysts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic disease worldwide distributed, caused by the cestode &lt;em&gt;Echinococcus granulosus&lt;/em&gt; sensu lato (&lt;em&gt;E. granulosus&lt;/em&gt;), with an incidence rate of 50/100,000 person/year and a high prevalence in humans of 5-10%. Serology has variable sensitivity and specificity and low predictive values. Antigens used are from the hydatid fluid and recombinant antigens have not demonstrated superiority over hydatid fluid. A cell line called EGPE was obtained from &lt;em&gt;E. granulosus&lt;/em&gt; sensu lato G1 strain from bovine liver. Serum from CE patients recognizes protein extracts from EGPE cells with higher sensitivity than protein extracts from hydatid fluid. In the present study, EGPE cell protein extracts and supernatants from cell colonies were eluted from a protein G affinity column performed with sera from 11 CE patients. LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of the eluted proteins identified four &lt;em&gt;E. granulosus&lt;/em&gt; histones: one histone H4 in the cell extract and supernatant, one histone H2A only in the cell extract, and two histones H2A only in the supernatant. This differential distribution of histones could reflect different parasite viability stages regarding their role in gene transcription and silencing and could interact with host cells. Bioinformatics tools characterized the linear and conformational epitopes involved in antibody recognition. The three-dimensional structure of each histone was obtained by molecular modeling and validated by molecular dynamics simulation and PCR confirmed the presence of the epitopes in the parasite genome. The three histones H2A were very different and had a less conserved sequence than the histone H4. Comparison of the histones of &lt;em&gt;E. granulosus&lt;/em&gt; with those of other organisms showed exclusive regions for &lt;em&gt;E. granulosus&lt;/em&gt;. Since histones play a role in the host-parasite relationship they could be good candidates to improve the predictive value of serology in CE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fyn-kinase and caveolin-1 in the alveolar epithelial junctional adherence complex contribute to the early stages of pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35710078/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current pathophysiological findings indicate that damage to the alveolar epithelium plays a decisive role in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The available pharmacological interventions (i.e., oral pirfenidone and nintedanib) only slow down progression of the disease, but do not offer a cure. In order to develop new drug candidates, the pathophysiology of IPF needs to be better understood on a molecular level. It has previously been reported that a loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) contributes to profibrotic processes by causing reduced alveolar barrier function and fibrosis-like alterations of the lung-parenchyma. Conversely, overexpression of caveolin-1 appears to counteract the development of fibrosis by inhibiting the inflammasome NLRP3 and the associated expression of interleukin-1Î². In this study, the interaction between Fyn-kinase and caveolin-1 in the alveolar epithelium of various bleomycin (BLM)/TGF-Î² damage models using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS), wildtype (WT) and caveolin-1 knockout (KO) mice as well as the human NCI-H441 cell line, were investigated. In WT mouse lung tissues, strong signals for Fyn-kinase were detected in alveolar epithelial type I cells, whereas in caveolin-1 KO animals, expression shifted to alveolar epithelial type II cells. Caveolin-1 and Fyn-kinase were found to be co-localized in isolated lipid rafts of NCI-H441 cell membrane fractions. These findings were corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation studies in which a co-localization of Cav-1 and Fyn-kinase was detected in the cell membrane of the alveolar epithelium. After TGF-Î² and BLM-induced damage to the alveolar epithelium both in PCLS and cell culture experiments, a decrease in caveolin-1 and Fyn-kinase was found. Furthermore, TEER (transepithelial electrical resistance) measurements indicated that TGF-Î² and BLM have a damaging effect on cell-cell contacts and thus impair the barrier function in NCI-H441 cell monolayers. This effect was attenuated after co-incubation with the Fyn-kinase inhibitor, PP-2. Our data suggest an involvement of Fyn-kinase and caveolin-1 in TGF-Î²/bleomycin-induced impairment of alveolar barrier function and thus a possible role in the early stages of pulmonary fibrosis. Fyn-kinase and/or its complex with caveolin-1 might, therefore, be novel therapeutic targets in IPF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spinal Cord Injury Impairs Lung Immunity in Mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35697382/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after spinal cord injury (SCI). Although SCI causes atrophy and dysfunction in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues with a corresponding decrease in the number and function of circulating leukocytes, it is unknown whether this SCI-dependent systemic immune suppression also affects the unique tissue-specific antimicrobial defense mechanisms that protect the lung. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that SCI directly impairs pulmonary immunity and subsequently increases the risk for developing pneumonia. Using mouse models of severe high-level SCI, we find that recruitment of circulating leukocytes and transcriptional control of immune signaling in the lung is impaired after SCI, creating an environment that is permissive for infection. Specifically, we saw a sustained loss of pulmonary leukocytes, a loss of alveolar macrophages at chronic time points postinjury, and a decrease in immune modulatory genes, especially cytokines, needed to eliminate pulmonary infections. Importantly, this injury-dependent impairment of pulmonary antimicrobial defense is only partially overcome by boosting the recruitment of immune cells to the lung with the drug AMD3100, a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that mobilizes leukocytes and hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow. Collectively, these data indicate that the immune-suppressive effects of SCI extend to the lung, a unique site of mucosal immunity. Furthermore, preventing lung infection after SCI will likely require novel strategies, beyond the use of orthodox antibiotics, to reverse or block tissue-specific cellular and molecular determinants of pulmonary immune surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Impact of Zinc Supplementation on Critically Ill Patients With Acute Kidney Injury: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35769374/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Zinc is an essential trace element involved in multiple metabolic processes. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with low plasma zinc, but outcomes with zinc supplementation in critically ill patients with AKI remain unknown. Our objective was to investigate the effectiveness of zinc supplementation in this patient population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Critically ill patients with AKI were identified from the Medical Informative Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Prosperity score matching (PSM) was applied to match patients receiving zinc treatment to those without zinc treatment. The association between zinc sulfate use and in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), and length of stay was determined by logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A total of 9,811 AKI patients were included in the study. PSM yielded 222 pairs of patients who received zinc treatment and those who did not. Zinc supplementation was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (HR = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.83) &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009) and 30-day mortality (HR = 0.51 (95% CI, 0.30, 0.86) &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012). In the subgroup analysis, zinc use was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in patients with stage 1 AKI and those with sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Zinc supplementation was associated with improved survival in critically ill patients with AKI. The supplementation was especially effective in those with stage 1 AKI and sepsis. These results need to be verified in randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influence of respiratory loading on left-ventricular function in cervical spinal cord injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35751465/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cervical spinal cord injury (C-SCI) negatively impacts cardiac and respiratory function. As the heart and lungs are linked via the pulmonary circuit these systems are interdependent. Here, we utilized inspiratory and expiratory loading to assess whether augmenting the respiratory pump improves left-ventricular (LV) filling and output in individuals with motor-complete C-SCI. We hypothesized LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) would increase and decrease with inspiratory and expiratory loading, respectively. Participants (C-SCI: 7M/1F, 35 Â± 7 years; able-bodied: 7M/1F, 32 Â± 6 years) were assessed under five conditions during 45Â° head-up tilt; unloaded, inspiratory loading with -10 and -20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oesophageal pressure (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;oes&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) on inspiration, and expiratory loading with +10 and +20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;oes&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on expiration. An oesophageal balloon catheter monitored &lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;oes&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; , and LV structure and function were assessed by echocardiography. In C-SCI only, (1) +20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O reduced LVEDV vs. unloaded (81 Â± 15 vs. 88 Â± 11 ml, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.006); (2) heart rate was higher during +20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O compared to unloaded (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001) and +10 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002); (3) cardiac output was higher during +20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O than unloaded (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002); and (4) end-expiratory lung volume was higher during +20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O vs. unloaded (63 Â± 10 vs. 55 Â± 13% total lung capacity, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003) but was unaffected by inspiratory loading. In both groups, -10 and -20 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O had no significant effect on LVEDV. These findings suggest greater expiratory positive pressure acutely impairs LV filling in C-SCI, potentially via impaired venous return, mediastinal constraint and/or direct ventricular interaction subsequent to dynamic hyperinflation. Inspiratory loading did not significantly improve LV function in C-SCI and neither inspiratory nor expiratory loading affected cardiac function or lung volumes in able-bodied participants. KEY POINTS: Cervical spinal cord injury (C-SCI) alters both the cardiac and the respiratory system, but little is known about how these systems interact following injury. Here, we manipulated inspiratory or expiratory intrathoracic pressure (ITP) to mechanistically test the role of the respiratory pump in circulatory function in highly trained individuals with C-SCI and an able-bodied reference group. In individuals with C-SCI, greater ITP during expiratory loading caused dynamic hyperinflation that was associated with impaired left-ventricular filling. More negative ITP during inspiratory loading did not significantly alter left-ventricular volumes in either group. Interventions that prevent dynamic hyperinflation and/or enhance the ability to generate expiratory pressures may help preserve left-ventricular filling in individuals with C-SCI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel inhalable quercetin-alginate nanogel as a promising therapy for acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35690763/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI), a severe health-threatening disease, has a risk of causing chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Informative and powerful evidence suggests that inflammation and oxidative stress play a central role in the pathogenesis of ALI. Quercetin is well recognized for its excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which showed great potential for ALI treatment. However, the application of quercetin is often hindered by its low solubility and bioavailability. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, an inhalable quercetin-alginate nanogel (QU-Nanogel) was fabricated, and by this special &amp;ldquo;material-drug&amp;rdquo; structure, the solubility and bioavailability of quercetin were significantly enhanced, which could further increase the activity of quercetin and provide a promising therapy for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; QU-Nanogel is a novel alginate and quercetin based &amp;ldquo;material-drug&amp;rdquo; structural inhalable nanogel, in which quercetin was stabilized by hydrogen bonding to obtain a &amp;ldquo;co-construct&amp;rdquo; water-soluble nanogel system, showing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. QU-Nanogel has an even distribution in size of less than 100 nm and good biocompatibility, which shows a stronger protective and antioxidant effect in vitro. Tissue distribution results provided evidence that the QU-Nanogel by ultrasonic aerosol inhalation is a feasible approach to targeted pulmonary drug delivery. Moreover, QU-Nanogel was remarkably reversed ALI rats by relieving oxidative stress damage and acting the down-regulation effects of mRNA and protein expression of inflammation cytokines via ultrasonic aerosol inhalation administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In the ALI rat model, this novel nanogel showed an excellent therapeutic effect by ultrasonic aerosol inhalation administration by protecting and reducing pulmonary inflammation, thereby preventing subsequent pulmonary fibrosis. This work demonstrates that this inhalable QU-Nanogel may function as a promising drug delivery strategy in treating ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RP105 is a member of the TLR family and its expression plays a role in cardiovascular disease but the therapeutic impact on acute kidney injury remained unclear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have uncovered evidence that RP105 expression in proximal tubular cells plays a kidney protective role during ischemic and septic acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RP105 reduces tubular cell death, NF-ÎºB activation and inflammatory response during AKI with a mechanism involving interaction with TLR4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This finding may have clinical translation as kidney protection and inflammation regulation could be achieved through RP105 gene therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical and severe clinical disease caused by a variety of factors. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in pathogenesis of AKI. Radioprotective 105 kDa protein (RP105) is a member of the TLR family, but the role of RP105 in AKI is unknown. In this study, we overexpressed RP105 in renal tissue and cultured proximal tubular cells in which we then induced ischemic and septic AKI. Renal structure injuries were examined by hematoxylin eosin staining, while renal function was assessed by measuring serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (SCr) levels. The TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis induced changes in the expression of RP105, and nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) in renal tissue detected by Western blot. Inflammatory cytokines including iNOS, IL-1Î², IL-6, and TNF-Î± were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The inflammatory indicators, F4/80 and MPO, were identified by IHC staining. The results showed that expression of the TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway was enhanced in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and septic renal injury, and that overexpression of RP105 in renal tissue alleviated ischemic and septic AKI. Moreover, RP105 gene delivery was associated with reduced renal inflammatory cells infiltration and inflammatory cytokines after AKI. RP105 overexpression also inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB after AKI in both in vitro and in vivo, and blunted the interaction between Myeloid Differentiation factor 2 (MD2) and TLR4. These results indicated that RP105 protected against renal ischemic and septic AKI injury by suppressing inflammatory responses mediated by TLR4 signaling pathways. This study suggests that the anti-inflammatory roles of RP105 have potential for preventing and treating renal ischemic and septic AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adoptively Transferred in vitro-Generated Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Improve T-Cell Function and Antigen-Specific Immunity after Traumatic Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35691281/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune reactions after trauma are characterized by immediate activation of innate immunity and simultaneously downregulation of adaptive immunity leading to a misbalanced immunohomeostasis and immunosuppression of the injured host. Therefore, the susceptibility to secondary infections is strongly increased after trauma. Immune responses are regulated by a network of immune cells influencing each other and at the same time modifying their functions dependent on the inflammatory environment. Although myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are initially described as T-cell suppressors, their immunomodulatory capacity after trauma is mostly undefined. Therefore, in vitro-generated MDSCs were adoptively transferred into mice after blunt chest trauma (TxT). A single MDSC treatment-induced splenic T-cell expansion decreased apoptosis sensitivity and improved proliferation in the absence of T-cell exhaustion until 2 weeks after trauma. MDSC treatment had a long-lasting effect on the genomic landscape of CD4+ T cells by upregulating primarily Th2-associated genes. Remarkably, immune-activating functions of MDSCs supported the ability of TxT mice to respond to post-traumatic secondary antigen challenge. Secondary insults were mimicked by immunizing MDSC-treated TxT mice with ovalbumin (OVA), followed by OVA restimulation in vitro. MDSC treatment significantly increased the frequency of OVA-specific T cells, enhanced their Th1/Th2 cytokine expression, and induced upregulation of cytolytic molecules finally improving OVA-specific cytotoxicity. Overall, we could show that therapeutic MDSC treatment after TxT improves post-traumatic T-cell functions, which might enable the traumatic host to counterbalance trauma-induced immunoparalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New mechanism of nephrotoxicity of triptolide: Oxidative stress promotes cGAS-STING signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35697291/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triptolide activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in kidney tubular cells in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STING inhibitor C176 had protective effects in TPL-induced nephrocyte damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triptolide induced an enhancement in protein levels of BACH1, while the expression of HMOX1 was reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oxidative stress-induced mtDNA damage and DNA leakage were the causes of the activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triptolide (TPL) is a bioactive component extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F., and has multiple pharmacological activities, such as anti-tumor activity. However, severe adverse effects and toxicity, especially nephrotoxicity, limit its clinical application. It has been demonstrated that mitochondrial defect is a major toxic effects of TPL. In this study, we show that triptolide activated the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in kidney tubular cells in vivo and in vitro. Renal injury models were established in BALB/c mice and human tubular epithelial cells using TPL. We found that TPL enhanced the phosphorylation levels of STING, TBK1 and IRF3, and upregulated the expression of IFNÎ², which is the production of cGAS-STING signaling pathway. STING inhibitor C176 had protective effects in TPL-induced nephrocyte damage. STING siRNA down regulated the expression level of IFNÎ². In addition, triptolide induced an increase in protein levels of the transcription factor BACH1, while transcriptional expression of the antioxidant enzyme HMOX1 was reduced due to the increased expression of BACH1. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced mtDNA damage and DNA leakage caused activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Altogether, cGAS-STING signaling pathway involved in TPL induced nephrotoxicity. Inhibiting cGAS-STING over-activation may be a new strategy for alleviating renal injury of triptolide.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human temperature regulation under heat stress in health, disease, and injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human body constantly exchanges heat with the environment. Temperature regulation is a homeostatic feedback control system that ensures deep body temperature is maintained within narrow limits despite wide variations in environmental conditions and activity-related elevations in metabolic heat production. Extensive research has been performed to study the physiological regulation of deep body temperature. This review focuses on healthy and disordered human temperature regulation during heat stress. Central to this discussion is the notion that various morphological features, intrinsic factors, diseases, and injuries independently and interactively influence deep body temperature during exercise and/or exposure to hot ambient temperatures. The first sections review fundamental aspects of the human heat stress response, including the biophysical principles governing heat balance and the autonomic control of heat loss thermoeffectors. Next, we discuss the effects of different intrinsic factors (morphology, heat adaptation, biological sex, and age), diseases (neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and genetic), and injuries (spinal cord injury, deep burns, and heat stroke), with emphasis on the mechanisms by which these factors enhance or disturb the regulation of deep body temperature during heat stress. We conclude with key unanswered questions in this field of research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TLR7 Mediates Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Sepsis by Sensing Extracellular miR-146a</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35679261/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLR7 (Toll-like receptor 7), the sensor for single-stranded RNA, contributes to systemic inflammation and mortality in murine polymicrobial sepsis. Recent studies show that extracellular miR-146a-5p serves as a TLR7 ligand and plays an important role in regulating host innate immunity. However, the role of miR-146a-5p and TLR7 signaling in pulmonary inflammation, endothelial activation, and sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome remains unclear. Here, we show that intratracheal administration of exogenous miR-146a-5p in mice evokes lung inflammation, activates endothelium, and increases endothelial permeability via TLR7-dependent mechanisms. TLR7 deficiency attenuates pulmonary barrier dysfunction and reduces lung inflammatory response in a murine sepsis model. Moreover, the impact of miR-146a-5p-TLR7 signaling on endothelial activation appears to be a secondary effect because TLR7 is undetectable in the human pulmonary artery and microvascular endothelial cells (ECs), which show no response to direct miR-146a-5p treatment &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Both conditioned media of miR-146a-5p-treated macrophages (MÏ) and septic sera of wild-type mice induce a marked EC barrier disruption &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, whereas MÏ conditioned media or septic sera of &lt;em&gt;TLR7&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice do not exhibit such effect. Cytokine array and pathway enrichment analysis of the MÏ conditioned media and septic sera identify TNFÎ± (tumor necrosis factor Î±) as the main downstream effector of miR-146a-5p-TLR7 signaling responsible for the EC barrier dysfunction, which is further supported by neutralizing anti-TNFÎ± antibody intervention. Together, these data demonstrate that TLR7 activation elicits pulmonary inflammation and endothelial barrier disruption by sensing extracellular miR-146a-5p and contributes to sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shema Oral Liquid Ameliorates the Severity of LPS-Induced COPD via Regulating DNMT1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35754478/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most common respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality. Shema oral liquid (Shema) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approved for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Clinical applications have shown that Shema has antitussive, expectorant, and anti-asthmatic effects, but its definite efficacy to COPD is still unclear. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic capacity and potential mechanism of Shema in treatment of COPD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Network pharmacology was used to investigated the possible pharmacological mechanism of Shema against COPD. A rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced COPD was established to determine pulmonary ventilatory function, serum inflammatory cytokines, and pulmonary pathological change. Subsequently, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics was used to further reveal the therapeutic targets related with Shema against COPD. Western blot was finally performed to validate the expression of targeted proteins screened by proteomics research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Network pharmacology analysis indicated that Shema against COPD mainly inhibited the inflammation and affected the immune system. The animal experiment demonstrated that Shema treatment protected the lung tissue from LPS induced injury, inhibited the levels of serum inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, and improved the respiratory ventilatory function by upregulating forced expiratory volume in 0.1 s (FEV0.1), FEV0.3, forced vital capacity (FVC), and the ratios of FEV0.1 (0.3)/FVC. Proteomic analysis and western blot both proved that Shema inhibited the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The therapeutic mechanism of Shema in treatment of COPD may involve inhibiting inflammatory response, improving pulmonary ventilatory function, and alleviating LPS-induced lung injury through regulating the expression of DNMT1. This study also shed light on the development of therapeutic strategies in treating COPD by intervening DNMT-related pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electronic cigarette vapor exposure exaggerates the pro-inflammatory response during influenza A viral infection in human distal airway epithelium</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic cigarettes or vaping products have been marketed as a safer alternative to smoking, but very little is known about the health effects in the human lung, particularly in the distal airways, a key site of airway obstruction and destruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is often exacerbated by viral infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of electronic cigarette vapor (e-vapor) on human distal airway epithelial responses to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We isolated primary small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) from donor lungs free of lung disease, and cultured them at air-liquid interface (ALI). To measure markers of epithelial injury such as integrity of epithelial barrier structure and function, we selected a regimen of non-toxic, barrier preserving e-vapor exposure of cultured cells to 15 puffs of e-vapor from a commercially available e-cigarette once per day for 3 days, prior to IAV infection. After 72 h of infection, media and cell lysates were collected to measure cytokines involved in inflammatory and antiviral responses. Pre-exposure to e-vapor with IAV infection, compared to IAV infection alone, significantly increased inflammatory and antiviral mediators including IL-8, CXCL10, IFN-beta, and MX1. Our results suggest that e-vapor exposure amplifies human distal airway pro-inflammatory response to IAV infection, independently of the severity of cell injury during viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PTPÎ± promotes fibroproliferative responses after acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35670474/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major healthcare problem, accounting for significant mortality and long-term disability. Approximately 25% of patients with ARDS will develop an overexuberant fibrotic response, termed fibroproliferative ARDS (FP-ARDS) that portends a poor prognosis and increased mortality. The cellular pathological processes that drive FP-ARDS remain incompletely understood. We have previously shown that the transmembrane receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase protein tyrosine phosphatase-Î± (PTPÎ±) promotes pulmonary fibrosis in preclinical murine models through regulation of transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²) signaling. In this study, we examine the role of PTPÎ± in the pathogenesis of FP-ARDS in a preclinical murine model of acid (HCl)-induced acute lung injury. We demonstrate that although mice genetically deficient in PTPÎ± (&lt;em&gt;Ptpra&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) are susceptible to early HCl-induced lung injury, they exhibit markedly attenuated fibroproliferative responses. In addition, early profibrotic gene expression is reduced in lung tissue after acute lung injury in &lt;em&gt;Ptpra&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, and stimulation of naÃ¯ve lung fibroblasts with the BAL fluid from these mice results in attenuated fibrotic outcomes compared with wild-type littermate controls. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrate reduced extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and remodeling in mice genetically deficient in PTPÎ±. Importantly, human lung fibroblasts modified with a CRISPR-targeted deletion of &lt;em&gt;PTPRA&lt;/em&gt; exhibit reduced expression of profibrotic genes in response to TGF-Î² stimulation, demonstrating the importance of PTPÎ± in human lung fibroblasts. Together, these findings demonstrate that PTPÎ± is a key regulator of fibroproliferative processes following acute lung injury and could serve as a therapeutic target for patients at risk for poor long-term outcomes in ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CaMK4 Promotes Acute Lung Injury Through NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation in Type II Alveolar Epithelial Cell</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35734175/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Type II alveolar epithelial cell (AEC II), in addition to its roles in maintaining lung homeostasis, takes an active role in inflammatory response during acute lung injury (ALI). Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK4) activated by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin signaling, has been implicated in immune responses. This study was to investigate the roles of CaMK4 in the development of ALI and the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; CaMK4 inhibitor KN-93 was used to investigate the effects of CaMK4 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The effects of KN-93 on disease development of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI were also evaluated. The role of CaMK4 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation was explored in human AEC II cell line A549 using KN-93 or CaMK4 siRNA. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was measured by histology immunofluorescence and Western blot. IL-1Î² and IL-18 were measured by ELISA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Phosphorylation of CaMK4 and the expression of NLRP3 and Caspase-1 p20 were increased in the lungs of LPS-induced ALI mice, which was suppressed by KN-93 as measured by Western blot. Further, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was detected in AEC II from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and LPS-induced ALI mice. In vitro, inhibition or silencing CaMK4 in AEC II significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, resulting in reduced IL-1Î² production. The inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and decreased IL-1Î²/IL-18 production by KN-93 led to reduced inflammatory infiltration and ameliorated lung injury in LPS-induced ALI mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; CaMK4 controls the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in AEC II during LPS-induced ALI. CaMK4 inhibition could be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigallocatechin Gallate Relieved PM2.5-Induced Lung Fibrosis by Inhibiting Oxidative Damage and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition through AKT/mTOR Pathway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative damage and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are main pathological processes leading to the development of PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis. Epigallocatechin gallate (EG), a natural polyphenol extracted from green tea, possesses the ability to combat oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the potential roles of EG in PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis have not been reported yet. In the present study, we investigated whether EG could relieve PM2.5-induced lung injury and fibrosis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. To mimic PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis, C57/BL6 mice were intranasally instilled with PM2.5 suspension, and MLE-12 lung epithelial cells were stimulated with PM2.5 (100 Î¼g/mL) &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. The results showed that intragastric administration of EG (20 mg/kg/d or 80 mg/kg/d for 8 weeks) significantly prevented lung injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress in PM2.5-induced mice, apart from inhibiting collagen deposition. Additionally, EG treatment also suppressed the activation of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in lung tissues challenged with PM2.5. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments further demonstrated that EG treatment could enhance cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner in PM2.5-treated MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. Also, the overexpression of constitutively active AKT could offset the inhibitory effects of EG on EMT and oxidative stress in PM2.5-treated MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. Finally, AKT overexpression also blocked the inhibitory effect of EG on the phosphorylation of mTOR in PM2.5-treated MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. In conclusion, EG could improve PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis by decreasing oxidative damage and EMT through AKT/mTOR pathway, which might be a potential candidate for the treatment of PM2.5-induced lung fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ginkgolide C Alleviates Acute Lung Injury Caused by Paraquat Poisoning via Regulating the Nrf2 and NF- Îº B Signaling Pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35707280/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paraquat (PQ), a highly toxic herbicide and primary attack for lung, results in severe acute lung injury (ALI) appeared as evident oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Increasing evidence elucidates that nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its associated nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) exhibit many merits for protection of ALI by coordinating a fine-turned response to oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Ginkgolide C (GC) has been reported to be a safe and potent therapeutic agent against ALI. However, whether GC could protect ALI induced by PQ poisoning and the possible underlining mechanisms have remained not to be fully elucidated. A rat model of ALI and a model of acute type II alveolar epithelial cell (RLE-6TN) injury constructed by exposure to PQ were applied to discuss the protective effect of GC. Furthermore, Nrf2 gene silencing RLE-6TN cells were used to discuss the exact mechanism. We confirmed that GC significantly ameliorated the histopathological damages, ultrastructural changes, lung injury score, W/D ratio, and Hyp activity of lung tissue and inhibited polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration after PQ poisoning. Further results revealed that GC remarkably activated Nrf2-based cytoprotective system and inhibited NF-ÎºB-induced inflammatory injury as well as apoptosis. Taken together, we concluded that GC preserved protection of PQ-induced ALI via the Nrf2-NF-ÎºB dependent signal pathway, which may provide us novel insights into the treatment strategies for PQ poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-155 deficiency protects renal tubular epithelial cells from telomeric and genomic DNA damage in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35832084/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Cisplatin nephrotoxicity is an important cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), limiting cisplatin application in cancer therapy. Growing evidence has suggested that genome instability, telomeric dysfunction, and DNA damage were involved in the tubular epithelial cells (TECs) damage in cisplatin-induced AKI (cAKI). However, the exact mechanism is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We subjected miR-155&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice and wild-type controls, as well as HK-2 cells, to cAKI models. We assessed kidney function and injury with standard techniques. The cell apoptosis and DNA damage of TECs were evaluated both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Telomeres were measured by the fluorescence &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; hybridization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The expression level of miR-155 was upregulated in cAKI. Inhibition of miR-155 expression protected cisplatin-induced AKI both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Compared with wild-type mice, miR-155&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had reduced mortality, improved renal function and pathological damage after cisplatin intervention. Moreover, inhibition of miR-155 expression attenuated TECs apoptosis and DNA damage. These protective effects were caused by increasing expression of telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12), thereby limiting the telomeric dysfunction and the genomic DNA damage in cAKI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; We demonstrated that miR-155 deficiency could significantly attenuate pathological damage and mortality in cAKI through inhibition of TECs apoptosis, genome instability, and telomeric dysfunction, which is possibly regulated by the increasing expression of TRF1 and CDK12. This study will provide a new molecular strategy for the prevention of cAKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting circNCLN/miR-291a-3p/TSLP signaling axis alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35679712/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disease caused by the severe and acute response of the lungs to a variety of direct and indirect insults. Patients with ALI are currently treated mainly with respiratory support due to inadequate understanding of ALI progression. Alveolar epithelial cells produced thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been proved to worsen ALI by triggering airway inflammation. However, the regulation mechanism of TSLP expression remains unclear. In this study, we identified the crucial role played by circNCLN in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. We demonstrated for the first time that miR-291a-3p could directly bind to the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR of TSLP and suppress TSLP expression in alveolar epithelial cells. Mechanistically, our data identified that circNCLN acts as a molecular sponge to antagonize miR-291a-3p and thereby maintaining the expression of TSLP in alveolar epithelial cells. Importantly, targeting circNCLN by its antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) markedly alleviated LPS-induced ALI. Therefore, our results suggested that circNCLN/miR-291a-3p/TSLP axis may be an important signaling in LPS-induced ALI and circNCLN inhibition may serve as a potential treatment of ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MG53 Inhibits Necroptosis Through Ubiquitination-Dependent RIPK1 Degradation for Cardiac Protection Following Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35711363/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; While reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been recognized as one of the main causes of cardiac injury following myocardial infarction, the clinical application of antioxidants has shown limited effects on protecting hearts against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Thus, the precise role of ROS following cardiac injury remains to be fully elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the role of mitsugumin 53 (MG53) in regulating necroptosis following I/R injury to the hearts and the involvement of ROS in MG53-mediated cardioprotection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods and results:&lt;/em&gt; Antioxidants were used to test the role of ROS in MG53-mediated cardioprotection in the mouse model of I/R injury and induced human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia or re-oxygenation (H/R) injury. Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation were used to identify potential cell death pathways that MG53 was involved in. CRISPR/Cas 9-mediated genome editing and mutagenesis assays were performed to further identify specific interaction amino acids between MG53 and its ubiquitin E3 ligase substrate. We found that MG53 could protect myocardial injury via inhibiting the necroptosis pathway. Upon injury, the generation of ROS in the infarct zone of the hearts promoted interaction between MG53 and receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, MG53 added multiple ubiquitin chains to RIPK1 at the sites of K316, K604, and K627 for proteasome-mediated RIPK1 degradation and inhibited necroptosis. The application of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) disrupted the interaction between MG53 and RIPK1 and abolished MG53-mediated cardioprotective effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Taken together, this study provided a molecular mechanism of a potential beneficial role of ROS following acute myocardial infarction. Thus, fine-tuning ROS levels might be critical for cardioprotection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polyphenols-Rich Fraction from Annona muricata Linn. Leaves Attenuates Oxidative and Inflammatory Responses in Neutrophils, Macrophages, and Experimental Lung Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annona muricata&lt;/em&gt; Linn. is a common plant found in the warmest regions of South and Central America and its use in traditional medicine has been reported for the treatment of various illnesses. In the current study, we investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of crude extract and fractions from &lt;em&gt;A. muricata&lt;/em&gt; L. leaves in isolated murine phagocytic immune cells as well as experimental LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI). In a luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assay, we showed that ethyl acetate (EtOAc.f) and n-butanol (BuOH.f) fractions-both rich in polyphenols-reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils stimulated with opsonized zymosan; similar results were found in culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). By evaluating anti-inflammatory activity in BMDMs, EtOAc.f and BuOH.f reduced secretion of IL-6 and expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD40. Furthermore, in LPS-induced ALI, oral administration of EtOAc.f reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissue. In addition, on a mechanism dependent on glutathione levels, the oxidative damage was also attenuated. These findings revealed direct antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of polyphenols-rich fractions of &lt;em&gt;A. muricata&lt;/em&gt; L. leaves on neutrophils and macrophages. Moreover, the reduced oxidative damage and levels of inflammatory markers in experimental ALI suggest that these fractions might be explored for the development of new therapies for inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Angiotensin 1-7 mitigates rhabdomyolysis induced renal injury in rats via modulation of TLR-4/NF-kB/iNOS and Nrf-2/hemeâoxygenase-1 signaling pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35654118/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RM induced kidney injury may be linked to the depletion of the ACE-2 and Ang1â7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ACE-2/Ang1â7/MasR axis may serve as a novel therapeutic option in RM-induced AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TLR-4/NF-kB/iNOS pathway may be involved in the renoprotective effect of Ang1â7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a critical condition with a high mortality rate, but effective management is still deficient. Till date, there are no studies that have addressed the effect of angiotensin 1-7 in this condition, hence, the rationale of this study was to evaluate the potential protective effect of Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7), on rhabdomyolysis (RM) induced kidney injury in rats and detecting the underlying mechanistic insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main methods:&lt;/em&gt; Forty adult male albino rats were divided into groups; the control group, RM group, RM+Ang1-7 group, and RM+Ang1-7+ A779 group. Sera and urine samples were collected for analysis of renal and muscle injury markers. Kidney tissues were taken for estimation of oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers as well as angiotensin-II (Ang II) and Ang1-7. Renal histology and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase-1 (iNOS), real-time PCR for angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), nuclear erythroid factor-2 (Nrf-2), Toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and NF-kB in kidney tissues were also measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key findings:&lt;/em&gt; Induction of RM caused renal oxidative stress injury, inflammation, apoptosis and marked deterioration in kidney functions as well as reduction of Ang1-7 and raised Angiotensin-II level in kidney tissues. Administration of Ang1-7 to the RM group reversed all the affected parameters which were blocked by A779 administration (Mas receptor blocker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significance:&lt;/em&gt; We concluded that Ang1-7 could be a potential therapeutic agent that could mitigate RM-induced renal injury. The underlying mechanisms may involve Stimulation of the ACE-2/Ang1-7/MasR axis and modulation of TLR-4/NF-kB/iNOS and Nrf-2/hemeâoxygenase -1 pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Caloric restriction reduces the pro-inflammatory eicosanoid 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid to protect from acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35654224/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury is a frequent complication in the clinical setting and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Preconditioning with short-term caloric restriction is highly protective against kidney injury in rodent ischemia reperfusion injury models. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown hampering clinical translation. Here, we examined the molecular basis of caloric restriction-mediated protection to elucidate the principles of kidney stress resistance. Analysis of an RNAseq dataset after caloric restriction identified Cyp4a12a, a cytochrome exclusively expressed in male mice, to be strongly downregulated after caloric restriction. Kidney ischemia reperfusion injury robustly induced acute kidney injury in male mice and this damage could be markedly attenuated by pretreatment with caloric restriction. In females, damage was significantly less pronounced and preconditioning with caloric restriction had only little effect. Tissue concentrations of the metabolic product of Cyp4a12a, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), were found to be significantly reduced by caloric restriction. Conversely, intraperitoneal supplementation of 20-HETE in preconditioned males partly abrogated the protective potential of caloric restriction. Interestingly, this effect was accompanied by a partial reversal of caloric restriction&amp;ndash;induced changes in protein but not RNA expression pointing towards inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress and lipid metabolism. Thus, our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying kidney protection by caloric restriction. Hence, understanding the mediators of preconditioning is an important prerequisite for moving towards translation to the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Persistent Activation of Autophagy After Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity Promotes Renal Fibrosis and Chronic Kidney Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35707397/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic pathway in eukaryotic cells, contributes to the maintenance of the homeostasis and function of the kidney. Upon acute kidney injury (AKI), autophagy is activated in renal tubular cells to act as an intrinsic protective mechanism. However, the role of autophagy in the development of chronic kidney pathologies including renal fibrosis after AKI remains unclear. In this study, we detected a persistent autophagy activation in mouse kidneys after nephrotoxicity of repeated low dose cisplatin (RLDC) treatment. 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ), respective inhibitors of autophagy at the initiation and degradation stages, blocked autophagic flux and improved kidney repair in post-RLDC mice, as indicated by kidney weight, renal function, and less interstitial fibrosis. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, RLDC induced a pro-fibrotic phenotype in renal tubular cells, including the production and secretion of pro-fibrotic cytokines. Notably, autophagy inhibitors blocked RLDC-induced secretion of pro-fibrotic cytokines in these cells. Together, the results indicate that persistent autophagy after AKI induces pro-fibrotic cytokines in renal tubular cells, promoting renal fibrosis and chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxemia is a defining feature of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an often-fatal complication of pulmonary or systemic inflammation, yet the resulting tissue hypoxia, and its impact on immune responses, is often neglected. In the present study, we have shown that ARDS patients were hypoxemic and monocytopenic within the first 48 h of ventilation. Monocytopenia was also observed in mouse models of hypoxic acute lung injury, in which hypoxemia drove the suppression of type I interferon signaling in the bone marrow. This impaired monopoiesis resulted in reduced accumulation of monocyte-derived macrophages and enhanced neutrophil-mediated inflammation in the lung. Administration of colony-stimulating factor 1 in mice with hypoxic lung injury rescued the monocytopenia, altered the phenotype of circulating monocytes, increased monocyte-derived macrophages in the lung and limited injury. Thus, tissue hypoxia altered the dynamics of the immune response to the detriment of the host and interventions to address the aberrant response offer new therapeutic strategies for ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lineage tracing analysis defines erythropoietin-producing cells as a distinct subpopulation of resident fibroblasts with unique behaviors</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35644281/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erythropoietin (Epo) is produced by a subpopulation of resident fibroblasts in the healthy kidney. We have previously demonstrated that, during kidney fibrosis, kidney fibroblasts including Epo-producing cells transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts and lose their Epo-producing ability. However, it remains unclear whether Epo-producing cells survive and transform into myofibroblasts during fibrosis because previous studies did not specifically label Epo-producing cells in pathophysiological conditions. Here, we generated &lt;em&gt;Epo&lt;sup&gt;CreERT2/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, a novel mouse strain that enables labeling of Epo-producing cells at desired time points and examined the behaviors of Epo-producing cells under pathophysiological conditions. Lineage-labeled cells that were producing Epo when labeled were found to be a small subpopulation of fibroblasts located in the interstitium of the kidney, and their number increased during phlebotomy-induced anemia. Around half of lineage-labeled cells expressed Epo mRNA, and this percentage was maintained even 16 weeks after recombination, supporting the idea that a distinct subpopulation of cells with Epo-producing ability makes Epo repeatedly. During fibrosis caused by ureteral obstruction, &lt;em&gt;Epo&lt;sup&gt;CreERT2/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;-labeled cells were found to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts with concomitant loss of Epo-producing ability, and their numbers and the proportion among resident fibroblasts increased during fibrosis, indicating their high proliferative capacity. Finally, we confirmed that &lt;em&gt;Epo&lt;sup&gt;CreERT2/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;-labeled cells that lost their Epo-producing ability during fibrosis regained their ability after kidney repair due to relief of the ureteral obstruction. Thus, our analyses have revealed previously unappreciated characteristic behaviors of Epo-producing cells, which had not been clearly distinguished from those of resident fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>METTL3-Mediated N6-Methyladenosine Modification of Trim59 mRNA Protects Against Sepsis-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35693774/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N6-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA modification is a fundamental determinant of mRNA metabolism in eukaryotic cells and is involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. However, the specific role of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification in sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) remains unknown. Here, we show that the levels of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A RNA were significantly decreased in septic lungs and that METTL3 was the main regulator involved in the absence of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A RNA modification. Pulmonary endothelial barrier damage is a critical process in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury during sepsis. METTL3 regulated endothelial barrier dysfunction and inflammatory responses in sepsis-induced ARDS &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Furthermore, we identified tripartite motif-containing (Trim)59 as a key m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A effector and Trim59 deficiency exacerbated lung injury. Mechanistically, METTL3 inhibited endothelial injury in sepsis-induced ARDS through Trim59-associated NF-ÎºB inactivation. Our findings revealed novel insights into epitranscriptional mechanisms in sepsis-induced ARDS via m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modifications, which has important application value in the diagnosis, prognosis, and molecular-targeted therapy of sepsis-associated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cell death and ischemia-reperfusion injury in lung transplantation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung transplantation is the most effective therapy for patients with end-stage lung disease. However, concern of donor lung damage and ischemia-reperfusion induced lung injury limits the use of &amp;ldquo;marginal&amp;rdquo; donor lungs. Recent transcriptomic studies have demonstrated that the enrichment of gene-clusters related to cell death and inflammation are the most profound signals during ischemia-reperfusion in human lung transplants. Herein, we focus on the relationship between inflammation and programmed cell death, especially necroptosis, mitochondrial permeability transition-initiated regulated necrosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagic cell death. Cell death-related molecules have been tested as potential biomarkers for donor lung assessment. Inhibitors for various types of cell death have been explored as therapeutics for ischemia reperfusion injury in lung transplantation. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms may help to improve donor management, organ preservation, prevention and treatment of primary graft dysfunction during and post transplantation. Moreover, evaluation and treatment of cell death and inflammation during ex vivo lung perfusion may be a game changer in donor organ management, assessment, repair, and reconditioning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Primary Graft Dysfunction: The Role of Aging in Lung Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transplant centers around the world have been using extended criteria donors to remedy the ongoing demand for lung transplantation. With a rapidly aging population, older donors are increasingly considered. Donor age, at the same time has been linked to higher rates of lung ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). This process of acute, sterile inflammation occurring upon reperfusion is a key driver of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) leading to inferior short- and long-term survival. Understanding and improving the condition of older lungs is thus critical to optimize outcomes. Notably, &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; lung perfusion (EVLP) seems to have the potential of reconditioning ischemic lungs through &lt;em&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/em&gt; perfusing and ventilation. Here, we aim to delineate mechanisms driving lung IRI and review both experimental and clinical data on the effects of aging in augmenting the consequences of IRI and PGD in lung transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and Purpose:&lt;/em&gt; Myocardial infarction (MI) in diabetic patients results in higher mortality and morbidity. We and others have previously shown that bone marrow-endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote cardiac neovascularization and attenuate ischemic injury. Lately, small extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as major paracrine effectors mediating the benefits of stem cell therapy. Modest clinical outcomes of autologous cell-based therapies suggest diabetes-induced EPC dysfunction and may also reflect their EV derivatives. Moreover, studies suggest that post-translational histone modifications promote diabetes-induced vascular dysfunctions. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that diabetic EPC-EVs may lose their post-injury cardiac reparative function by modulating histone modification in endothelial cells (ECs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We collected EVs from the culture medium of EPCs isolated from non-diabetic (db/+) and diabetic (db/db) mice and examined their effects on recipient ECs and cardiomyocytes &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and their reparative function in permanent ligation of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) myocardial ischemic injuries &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Compared to db/+ EPC-EVs, db/db EPC-EVs promoted EC and cardiomyocyte apoptosis and repressed tube-forming capacity of ECs. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, db/db EPC-EVs depressed cardiac function, reduced capillary density, and increased fibrosis compared to db/+ EPC-EV treatments after MI. Moreover, in the I/R MI model, db/+ EPC-EV-mediated acute cardio-protection was lost with db/db EPC-EVs, and db/db EPC-EVs increased immune cell infiltration, infarct area, and plasma cardiac troponin-I. Mechanistically, histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) was significantly decreased in cardiac ECs treated with db/db EPC-EVs compared to db/+ EPC-EVs. The H3K9Ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) results further revealed that db/db EPC-EVs reduced H3K9Ac level on angiogenic, cell survival, and proliferative genes in cardiac ECs. We found that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, valproic acid (VPA), partly restored diabetic EPC-EV-impaired H3K9Ac levels, tube formation and viability of ECs, and enhanced cell survival and proliferative genes, &lt;em&gt;Pdgfd&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sox12&lt;/em&gt;, expression. Moreover, we observed that VPA treatment improved db/db EPC-mediated post-MI cardiac repair and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings unravel that diabetes impairs EPC-EV reparative function in the ischemic heart, at least partially, through HDACs-mediated H3K9Ac downregulation leading to transcriptional suppression of angiogenic, proliferative and cell survival genes in recipient cardiac ECs. Thus, HDAC inhibitors may potentially be used to restore the function of diabetic EPC and other stem cells for autologous cell therapy applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Malondialdehyde Acetaldehyde-Adduction Changes Surfactant Protein D Structure and Function</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35669781/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption with concurrent cigarette smoking produces malondialdehyde acetaldehyde (MAA)-adducted lung proteins. Lung surfactant protein D (SPD) supports innate immunity via bacterial aggregation and lysis, as well as by enhancing macrophage-binding and phagocytosis. MAA-adducted SPD (SPD-MAA) has negative effects on lung cilia beating, macrophage function, and epithelial cell injury repair. Because changes in SPD multimer structure are known to impact SPD function, we hypothesized that MAA-adduction changes both SPD structure and function. Purified human SPD and SPD-MAA (1 mg/mL) were resolved by gel filtration using Sephadex G-200 and protein concentration of each fraction determined by Bradford assay. Fractions were immobilized onto nitrocellulose by slot blot and assayed by Western blot using antibodies to SPD and to MAA. Binding of SPD and SPD-MAA was determined fluorometrically using GFP-labeled &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; (GFP-SP). Anti-bacterial aggregation of GFP-SP and macrophage bacterial phagocytosis were assayed by microscopy and permeability determined by bacterial phosphatase release. Viral injury was measured as LDH release in RSV-treated airway epithelial cells. Three sizes of SPD were resolved by gel chromatography as monomeric, trimeric, and multimeric forms. SPD multimer was the most prevalent, while the majority of SPD-MAA eluted as trimer and monomer. SPD dose-dependently bound to GFP-SP, but SPD-MAA binding to bacteria was significantly reduced. SPD enhanced, but MAA adduction of SPD prevented, both aggregation and macrophage phagocytosis of GFP-SP. Likewise, SPD increased bacterial permeability while SPD-MAA did not. In the presence of RSV, BEAS-2B cell viability was enhanced by SPD, but not protected by SPD-MAA. Our results demonstrate that MAA adduction changes the quaternary structure of SPD from multimer to trimer and monomer leading to a decrease in the native anti-microbial function of SPD. These findings suggest one mechanism for increased pneumonia observed in alcohol use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MiR-29a-3p Improves Acute Lung Injury by Reducing Alveolar Epithelial Cell PANoptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35656115/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alveolar epithelial cell damage is an important determinant of the severity of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). However, the molecular mechanisms of alveolar epithelial death during the development of ALI/ARDS remain unclear. In this study, we explore the role of miR-29a-3p in ALI/ARDS and its molecular mechanism. Plasma samples were collected from healthy controls and ARDS patients. Mice were intratracheally instilled with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish acute lung injury. N6-adenosine (m6A) quantification, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, cell viability assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting were performed. We found that miR-29a-3p was down-regulated in plasma of ARDS patients and lung tissue of ALI model mice, and miR-29a-3p agomir injection down-regulated the levels of the inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the lungs, reducing alveolar epithelial cell PANoptosis as evaluated by the downregulation of Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), gasdermin D (GSDMD), caspase-3, caspase-8, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), ultimately improving lung injury in the ALI model mice. Mechanism studies demonstrated that the knockout of methyltransferase 3 (N6-adenosine-methyltransferase complex catalytic subunit) removed the m6A modification of miR-29a-3p and reduced miR-29a-3p expression. Our findings suggest that miR-29a-3p is a potential target that can be manipulated for ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metformin Regulates Alveolar Macrophage Polarization to Protect Against Acute Lung Injury in Rats Caused by Paraquat Poisoning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study explored the role of metformin (MET) in regulating the polarization of alveolar macrophages to protect against acute lung injury (ALI) in rats caused by paraquat (PQ) poisoning. The &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; studies showed that the 35 mg/kg dose of MET increased the survival rate of rats, alleviated pathological damages to the lungs and their systemic inflammation, promoted the reduction of the pro-inflammatory factors interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) levels, and increased the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 levels in the rat serum. At the same time, the MET intervention decreased the expression of M1 macrophage marker iNOS in the lungs of the PQ-poisoned rats while increasing the M2 macrophage marker, Arg1, expression. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, the concentration of MET &amp;gt; 10 mmol/L affected NR8383 viability adversely and was concentration-dependent; however, no adverse impact on NR8383 viability was observed at MET â¤ 10 mmol/L concentration, resisting the reducing effect of PQ on NR8383 vitality. The PQ-induced NR8383 model with MET intervention showed significantly reduced secretions of IL-6 and TNF-Î± in NR8383, and lowered expressions of M1 macrophage markers iNOS and CD86. Additionally, MET increased IL-10 secretion and the M2 macrophage markers, Arg1 and Mrcl, expressions. Therefore, we speculate that MET could regulate alveolar macrophage polarization to protect against PQ-poisoning caused ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the anti-inflammatory role and underlying molecular in cadmium-induced lung injury have been poorly understood, directly linked to chronic lung diseases (CLDs): chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer etc. Therefore, in this study we aim to investigate the therapeutic activities of water extract of KRG (KRG-WE) in mouse cadmium-induced lung injury model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Method:&lt;/em&gt; The anti-inflammatory roles and underlying mechanisms of KRG-WE were evaluated in vitro under cadmium-stimulated lung epithelial cells (A549) and HEK293T cell line and in vivo in cadmium-induced lung injury mouse model using semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), luciferase assay, immunoblotting, and FACS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; KRG-WE strongly ameliorated the symptoms of CdSO4-induced lung injury in mice according to total cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and severity scores as well as cytokine levels. KRG-WE significantly suppressed the upregulation of inflammatory signaling comprising mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and their upstream enzymes. In in vitro study, KRG-WE suppressed expression of interleukin (IL)-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and IL-8 while promoting recovery in CdSO4-treated A549 cells. Similarly, KRG-WE reduced phosphorylation of MAPK and c-Jun/c-Fos in cadmium-exposed A549 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; KRG-WE was found to attenuate symptoms of cadmium-induced lung injury and reduce the expression of inflammatory genes by suppression of MAPK/AP-1-mediated pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CircEXOC5 promotes ferroptosis by enhancing ACSL4 mRNA stability via binding to PTBP1 in sepsis-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35709678/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis causes severe acute lung injury (ALI). Circular RNA is involved in the regulation of sepsis-related ALI progression. The regulation mechanism of circEXOC5 in sepsis-induced ALI is still unclear. Whether circEXOC5 is involved in the regulation of ferroptosis remains to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We constructed a mouse model of sepsis through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). LPS induced mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells (MPVECs) to construct a sepsis cell model. The expression of circEXOC5 in the sepsis model was detected by qPCR. The extent of lung injury in mice was analyzed by HE staining. The contents of GSH/GSSG, iron, MDA and 4HNE in mice lung tissues and cells were detected by the kit. And further the ROS content was detected in the cells. Finally, the binding relationship between circEXOC5 and PTBP1 was detected by RIP and RNA pulldown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Our results showed that the circEXOC5 expression was significantly increased in the &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; models of sepsis. And after inhibiting circEXOC5, it improved the lung injury of septic mice. It was confirmed in cell models that ROS levels and ferroptosis in cells were reduced after knocking down circEXOC5. In addition, the expressions of ACSL4 and Gpx4 proteins were regulated by the level of circEXOC5. Finally, we also found that circEXOC5 had a direct binding relationship with PTBP1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study found that the expression of cell ferroptosis and circEXOC5 increased in ALI induced by sepsis, and circEXOC5 aggravated ferroptosis in septic cells by regulating the PTBP1/ACSL4 axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loss of Sam50 in hepatocytes induces cardiolipin-dependent mitochondrial membrane remodeling to trigger mtDNA release and liver injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35313046/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam50, a key component of the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) complex, is also involved in bridging mitochondrial outer-membrane and inner-membrane contacts. However, the physiological and pathological functions of Sam50 remain largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we show that Sam50 interacts with MICOS (mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system) and ATAD3 (ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 3) to form the Sam50-MICOS-ATAD3-mtDNA axis, which maintains mtDNA stability. Loss of Sam50 causes mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) aggregation. Furthermore, Sam50 cooperates with Mic60 to bind to cardiolipin, maintaining the integrity of mitochondrial membranes. Sam50 depletion leads to cardiolipin externalization, which causes mitochondrial outer-membrane and inner-membrane (including crista membrane) remodeling, triggering Bax mitochondrial recruitment, mtDNA aggregation, and release. Physiologically, acetaminophen (an effective antipyretic and analgesic)-caused Sam50 reduction or Sam50 liver-specific knockout induces mtDNA release, leading to activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and liver inflammation in mice. Moreover, exogenous expression of Sam50 remarkably attenuates APAP-induced liver hepatoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings uncover the critical role of Sam50 in maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and mtDNA stability in hepatocytes and reveal that Sam50 depletion-induced cardiolipin externalization is a signal of mtDNA release and controls mtDNA-dependent innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ubiquitin ligase E3 HUWE1/MULE targets transferrin receptor for degradation and suppresses ferroptosis in acute liver injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35260822/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatic ischemia followed by reperfusion (I/R), a major clinical problem during liver surgical procedures, can induce liver injury with severe cell death including ferroptosis which is characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxidation. The HECT domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase HUWE1 (also known as MULE) was initially shown to promote apoptosis. However, our preliminary study demonstrates that high expression of HUWE1 in the liver donors corelates with less injury and better hepatic function after liver transplantation in patients. Thus, we investigate the role of HUWE1 in acute liver injury, and identify HUWE1 as a negative ferroptosis modulator through transferrin receptor 1(TfR1). Deficiency of Huwe1 in mice hepatocytes (HKO) exacerbated I/R and CCl4-induced liver injury with more ferroptosis occurrence. Moreover, Suppression of Huwe1 remarkably enhances cellular sensitivity to ferroptosis in primary hepatocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Mechanistically, HUWE1 specifically targets TfR1 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby regulates iron metabolism. Importantly, chemical and genetic inhibition of TfR1 dramatically diminishes the ferroptotic cell death in Huwe1 KO cells and Huwe1 HKO mice. Therefore, HUWE1 is a potential protective factor to antagonize both aberrant iron accumulation and ferroptosis thereby mitigating acute liver injury. These findings may provide clinical implications for patients with the high-expression Huwe1 alleles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modeling injury and repair in kidney organoids reveals that homologous recombination governs tubular intrinsic repair</title>

&lt;p&gt;Erratum for the Research Article, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.add0524&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modeling injury and repair in kidney organoids reveals that homologous recombination governs tubular intrinsic repair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by N. Gupta et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidneys have the capacity for intrinsic repair, preserving kidney architecture with return to a basal state after tubular injury. When injury is overwhelming or repetitive, however, that capacity is exceeded and incomplete repair results in fibrotic tissue replacing normal kidney parenchyma. Loss of nephrons correlates with reduced kidney function, which defines chronic kidney disease (CKD) and confers substantial morbidity and mortality to the worldwide population. Despite the identification of pathways involved in intrinsic repair, limited treatments for CKD exist, partly because of the limited throughput and predictivity of animal studies. Here, we showed that kidney organoids can model the transition from intrinsic to incomplete repair. Single-nuclear RNA sequencing of kidney organoids after cisplatin exposure identified 159 differentially expressed genes and 29 signal pathways in tubular cells undergoing intrinsic repair. Homology-directed repair (HDR) genes including Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (&lt;em&gt;FANCD2&lt;/em&gt;) and RAD51 recombinase (&lt;em&gt;RAD51&lt;/em&gt;) were transiently up-regulated during intrinsic repair but were down-regulated in incomplete repair. Single cellular transcriptomics in mouse models of obstructive and hemodynamic kidney injury and human kidney samples of immune-mediated injury validated HDR gene up-regulation during tubular repair. Kidney biopsy samples with tubular injury and varying degrees of fibrosis confirmed loss of FANCD2 during incomplete repair. Last, we performed targeted drug screening that identified the DNA ligase IV inhibitor, SCR7, as a therapeutic candidate that rescued FANCD2/RAD51-mediated repair to prevent the progression of CKD in the cisplatin-induced organoid injury model. Our findings demonstrate the translational utility of kidney organoids to identify pathologic pathways and potential therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effect of lung pericyte-like cell ablation on the bleomycin model of injury and repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35196901/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We previously showed that pericyte-like cells derived from the FoxD1-lineage contribute to myofibroblasts following bleomycin-induced lung injury. However, their functional significance in lung fibrosis remains unknown. In this study, we used a model of lung pericyte-like cell ablation to test the hypothesis that pericyte-like cell ablation attenuates lung fibrosis in bleomycin-induced lung injury. Lung fibrosis was induced by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. To ablate pericyte-like cells in the lung, diphtheria toxin (DT) was administered to &lt;em&gt;Foxd1-Cre&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt;Rosa26-iDTR&lt;/em&gt; mice at two different phases of bleomycin-induced lung injury. For early ablation, we coadministered bleomycin with DT and harvested mice at days 7 and 21. To test the effect of ablation after acute injury, we delivered DT 7 days after bleomycin administration. We assessed fibrosis by lung hydroxyproline content and semiquantitative analysis of picrosirius red staining. We performed bronchoalveolar lavage to determine cell count and differential. We also interrogated mRNA expression of fibrosis-related genes in whole lung RNA. Compared with DT-insensitive littermates where pericyte-like cells were not ablated, DT-sensitive animals exhibited no difference in fibrosis at day 21 both in the early and late pericyte ablation models. However, early ablation of pericytes reduced acute lung inflammation, as indicated by decreased inflammatory cells. Our data confirm a role for pericytes in regulating pulmonary inflammation in early lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Serum Protein Exposure Activates a Core Regulatory Program Driving Human Proximal Tubule Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35197326/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The kidneys efficiently filter waste products while retaining serum proteins in the circulation. However, numerous diseases compromise this barrier function, resulting in spillage of serum proteins into the urine (proteinuria). Some studies of glomerular filtration suggest that tubules may be physiologically exposed to nephrotic-range protein levels. Therefore, whether serum components can directly injure the downstream tubular portions of the kidney, which in turn can lead to inflammation and fibrosis, remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We tested the effects of serum protein exposure in human kidney tubule microphysiologic systems and with orthogonal epigenomic approaches since animal models cannot directly assess the effect of serum components on tubules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Serum, but not its major protein component albumin, induced tubular injury and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Epigenomic comparison of serum-injured tubules and intact kidney tissue revealed canonical stress-inducible regulation of injury-induced genes. Concordant transcriptional changes in microdissected tubulointerstitium were also observed in an independent cohort of patients with proteinuric kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our results demonstrate a causal role for serum proteins in tubular injury and identify regulatory mechanisms and novel pathways for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tidal Volume-Dependent Activation of the Renin-Angiotensin System in Experimental Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35191411/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt; Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Mechanical damage to the lungs is potentially aggravated by the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This article describes RAS activation profiles in VILI and discusses the effects of angiotensin (Ang) 1-7 supplementation or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril as protective strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design:&lt;/em&gt; Animal study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting:&lt;/em&gt; University research laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjects:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interventions:&lt;/em&gt; Anesthetized mice ( n = 12-18 per group) were mechanically ventilated with low tidal volume (LV T , 6 mL/kg), high tidal volume (HV T , 15 mL/kg), or very high tidal volume (VHV T , 30 mL/kg) for 4 hours, or killed after 3 minutes (sham). Additional VHV T groups received infusions of 60 Î¼g/kg/hr Ang 1-7 or a single dose of 100 mg/kg captopril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and main results:&lt;/em&gt; VILI was characterized by increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of interleukin (IL)-6, keratinocyte-derived cytokine, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP2). The Ang metabolites in plasma measured with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry showed a strong activation of the classical (Ang I, Ang II) and alternative RAS (Ang 1-7, Ang 1-5), with highest concentrations found in the HV T group. Although the lung-tissue ACE messenger RNA expression was unchanged, its protein expression showed a dose-dependent increase under mechanical ventilation. The ACE2 messenger RNA expression decreased in all ventilated groups, whereas ACE2 protein levels remained unchanged. Both captopril and Ang 1-7 led to markedly increased Ang 1-7 plasma levels, decreased Ang II levels, and ACE activity (Ang II/Ang I ratio), and effectively prevented VILI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; VILI is accompanied by a strong activation of the RAS. Based on circulating Ang metabolite levels and tissue expression of RAS enzymes, classical ACE-dependent and alternative RAS cascades were activated in the HV T group, whereas classical RAS activation prevailed with VHV T ventilation. Ang 1-7 or captopril protected from VILI primarily by modifying the systemic RAS profile.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coal dust exposure triggers heterogeneity of transcriptional profiles in mouse pneumoconiosis and Vitamin D remedies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35057792/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Coal dust particles (CDP), an inevitable by-product of coal mining for the environment, mainly causes coal workers&amp;rsquo; pneumoconiosis (CWP). Long-term exposure to coal dust leads to a complex alternation of biological processes during regeneration and repair in the healing lung. However, the cellular and complete molecular changes associated with pulmonary homeostasis caused by respiratory coal dust particles remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; This study mainly investigated the pulmonary toxicity of respirable-sized CDP in mice using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing. CDP (&amp;lt; 5 Î¼m) collected from the coal mine was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Mass Spectrometer. In addition, western blotting, Elisa, QPCR was used to detect gene expression at mRNA or protein levels. Pathological analysis including HE staining, Masson staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to characterize the structure and functional alternation in the pneumoconiosis mouse and verify the reliability of single-cell sequencing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; SEM image and Mass Spectrometer analysis showed that coal dust particles generated during coal mine production have been crushed and screened with a diameter of less than 5 Âµm and contained less than 10% silica. Alveolar structure and pulmonary microenvironment were destroyed, inflammatory and death (apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis) pathways were activated, leading to pneumoconiosis in post 9 months coal dust stimulation. A distinct abnormally increased alveolar type 2 epithelial cell (AT2) were classified with a highly active state but reduced the antimicrobial-related protein expression of LYZ and Chia1 after CDP exposure. Beclin1, LC3B, LAMP2, TGF-Ã, and MLPH were up-regulated induced by CDP, promoting autophagy and pulmonary fibrosis. A new subset of macrophages with M2-type polarization double expressed MLPH + /CD206 + was found in mice having pneumoconiosis but markedly decreased after the Vitamin D treatment. Activated MLPH + /CD206 + M2 macrophages secreted TGF-Î²1 and are sensitive to Vitamin D treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This is the first study to reconstruct the pathologic progression and transcriptome pattern of coal pneumoconiosis in mice. Coal dust had obvious toxic effects on lung epithelial cells and macrophages and eventually induced pulmonary fibrosis. CDP-induced M2-type macrophages could be inhibited by VD, which may be related to the alleviation of the pulmonary fibrosis process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human pluripotent stem cell-based in vitro pulmonary fibrosis model was established&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bleomycin-treated alveolar organoids showed epithelium-dependent contraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abnormal differentiation state and cellular senescence in AT2 cells were mimicked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inhibition of TGFÎ² signaling ameliorated the fibrogenic changes of the disease model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although alveolar epithelial cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, few practical in vitro models exist to study them. Here, we established a novel in vitro pulmonary fibrosis model using alveolar organoids consisting of human pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar epithelial cells and primary human lung fibroblasts. In this human model, bleomycin treatment induced phenotypes such as epithelial cell-mediated fibroblast activation, cellular senescence, and presence of alveolar epithelial cells in abnormal differentiation states. Chemical screening performed to target these abnormalities showed that inhibition of ALK5 or blocking of integrin Î±VÎ²6 ameliorated the fibrogenic changes in the alveolar organoids. Furthermore, organoid contraction and extracellular matrix accumulation in the model recapitulated the pathological changes observed in pulmonary fibrosis. This human model may therefore accelerate the development of highly effective therapeutic agents for otherwise incurable pulmonary fibrosis by targeting alveolar epithelial cells and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhaled curcumin mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles against radiation pneumonitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35646537/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation therapy is an effective method to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors using high-energy X-ray or Î³-ray. Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is one of the most serious complications of radiation therapy for thoracic cancers, commonly leading to serious respiratory distress and poor prognosis. Here, we prepared curcumin-loaded mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (CMPN) for prevention and treatment of RP by pulmonary delivery. Mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (MPDA) were successfully synthesized with an emulsion-induced interface polymerization method and curcumin was loaded in MPDA via ÏâÏ stacking and hydrogen bonding interaction. MPDA owned the uniform spherical morphology with numerous mesopores that disappeared after loading curcumin. More than 80% curcumin released from CMPN in 6 h and mesopores recovered. CMPN remarkably protected BEAS-2B cells from Î³-ray radiation injury by inhibiting apoptosis. RP rat models were established after a single dose of 15 Gy &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co Î³-ray radiation was performed on the chest area. Effective therapy of RP was achieved by intratracheal administration of CMPN due to free radical scavenging and anti-oxidation ability, and reduced proinflammatory cytokines, high superoxide dismutase, decreased malondialdehyde, and alleviated lung tissue damages were observed. Inhaled CMPN paves a new avenue for the treatment of RP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Biosafety Level 2 Mouse Model for Studying Betacoronavirus-Induced Acute Lung Damage and Systemic Manifestations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34495692/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of life-threatening zoonotic diseases caused by betacoronaviruses, including the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, has highlighted the need for developing preclinical models mirroring respiratory and systemic pathophysiological manifestations seen in infected humans. Here, we showed that C57BL/6J wild-type mice intranasally inoculated with the murine betacoronavirus murine hepatitis coronavirus 3 (MHV-3) develop a robust inflammatory response leading to acute lung injuries, including alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and fibrin thrombi. Although such histopathological changes seemed to resolve as the infection advanced, they efficiently impaired respiratory function, as the infected mice displayed restricted lung distention and increased respiratory frequency and ventilation. Following respiratory manifestation, the MHV-3 infection became systemic, and a high virus burden could be detected in multiple organs along with morphological changes. The systemic manifestation of MHV-3 infection was also marked by a sharp drop in the number of circulating platelets and lymphocytes, besides the augmented concentration of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1Î²), IL-6, IL-12, gamma interferon (IFN-Î³), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), thereby mirroring some clinical features observed in moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. Importantly, both respiratory and systemic changes triggered by MHV-3 infection were greatly prevented by blocking TNF signaling, either via genetic or pharmacologic approaches. In line with this, TNF blockage also diminished the infection-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines and virus replication of human epithelial lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Collectively, results show that MHV-3 respiratory infection leads to a large range of clinical manifestations in mice and may constitute an attractive, lower-cost, biosafety level 2 (BSL2) in vivo platform for evaluating the respiratory and multiorgan involvement of betacoronavirus infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouse models have long been used as valuable in vivo platforms to investigate the pathogenesis of viral infections and effective countermeasures. The natural resistance of mice to the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has launched a race toward the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection in other animals (e.g., hamsters, cats, ferrets, bats, and monkeys), as well as adaptation of the mouse model, by modifying either the host or the virus. In the present study, we utilized a natural pathogen of mice, MHV, as a prototype to model betacoronavirus-induced acute lung injure and multiorgan involvement under biosafety level 2 conditions. We showed that C57BL/6J mice intranasally inoculated with MHV-3 develops severe disease, which includes acute lung damage and respiratory distress that precede systemic inflammation and death. Accordingly, the proposed animal model may provide a useful tool for studies regarding betacoronavirus respiratory infection and related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are fundamental for intercellular communication and influence nearly every process in cell physiology. However, because of their intricate molecular complexity, quantitative knowledge on their signaling mechanisms is missing, particularly impeding their therapeutic application. We used a complementary and quantitative engineering approach based on sequential synthetic bottom-up assembly of fully functional EVs with precisely controlled lipid, protein, and RNA composition. We show that the functionalities of synthetic EVs are analogous to natural EVs and demonstrate their programmable therapeutic administration for wound healing and neovascularization therapy. We apply transcriptome profiling to systematically decode synergistic effects between individual EV constituents, enabling analytical dissection and a fundamental understanding of EV signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IL-1Î² augments TGF-Î² inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition of epithelial cells and associates with poor pulmonary function improvement in neutrophilic asthmatics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34344357/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/34344357/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophilic asthmatics (NA) have less response to inhaled corticosteroids. We aimed to find out the predictor of treatment response in NA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthmatics (n = 115) and healthy controls (n = 28) underwent clinical assessment during 6-month follow-up with standardized therapy. Asthmatics were categorized by sputum differential cell count. The mRNA expressions were measured by RT-qPCR for sputum cytokines (IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², IL-27, FOXP3, IL-17A, and IL-5). The protein of IL-1Î² in sputum supernatant was detected by ELISA. Reticular basement membranes (RBM) were measured in the biopsy samples. The role and signaling pathways of IL-1Î² mediating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process were explored through A549 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NA had increased baseline sputum cell IL-1Î² expression compared to eosinophilic asthmatics (EA). After follow-up, NA had less improvement in FEV1 compared to EA. For all asthmatics, sputum IL-1Î² mRNA was positively correlated with protein expression. Sputum IL-1Î² mRNA and protein levels were negatively correlated to FEV1 improvement. After subgrouping, the correlation between IL-1Î² mRNA and FEV1 improvement was significant in NA but not in EA. Thickness of RBM in asthmatics was greater than that of healthy controls and positively correlated with neutrophil percentage in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In vitro experiments, the process of IL-1Î² augmenting TGF-Î²1-induced EMT cannot be abrogated by glucocorticoid or montelukast sodium, but can be reversed by MAPK inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IL-1Î² level in baseline sputum predicts the poor lung function improvement in NA. The potential mechanism may be related to IL-1Î² augmenting TGF-Î²1-induced steroid-resistant EMT through MAPK signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammatory responses induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with severe symptoms of COVID-19. Inflammasomes activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are also associated with COVID-19 severity. Here, we show a distinct mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation to induce hyperinflammation. N protein facilitates maturation of proinflammatory cytokines and induces proinflammatory responses in cultured cells and mice. Mechanistically, N protein interacts directly with NLRP3 protein, promotes the binding of NLRP3 with ASC, and facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. More importantly, N protein aggravates lung injury, accelerates death in sepsis and acute inflammation mouse models, and promotes IL-1Î² and IL-6 activation in mice. Notably, N-induced lung injury and cytokine production are blocked by MCC950 (a specific inhibitor of NLRP3) and Ac-YVAD-cmk (an inhibitor of caspase-1). Therefore, this study reveals a distinct mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and induces excessive inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enterically derived high-density lipoprotein restrains liver injury through the portal vein</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) requires apoA1 and the cholesterol transporter ABCA1. Although the liver generates most of the HDL in the blood, HDL synthesis also occurs in the small intestine. Here, we show that intestine-derived HDL traverses the portal vein in the HDL3 subspecies form, in complex with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP). HDL3, but not HDL2 or low-density lipoprotein, prevented LPS binding to and inflammatory activation of liver macrophages and instead supported extracellular inactivation of LPS. In mouse models involving surgical, dietary, or alcoholic intestinal insult, loss of intestine-derived HDL worsened liver injury, whereas outcomes were improved by therapeutics that elevated and depended upon raising intestinal HDL. Thus, protection of the liver from injury in response to gut-derived LPS is a major function of intestinally synthesized HDL.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GPR34-mediated sensing of lysophosphatidylserine released by apoptotic neutrophils activates type 3 innate lymphoid cells to mediate tissue repair</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34107271/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils migrate rapidly to damaged tissue and play critical roles in host defense and tissue homeostasis. Here we investigated the mechanisms whereby neutrophils participate in tissue repair. In an intestinal epithelia injury model, neutrophil depletion exacerbated colitis and associated with reduced interleukin (IL)-22 and limited activation of type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). Co-culture with neutrophils activated ILC3s in a manner dependent on neutrophil apoptosis. Metabolomic analyses revealed that lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) from apoptotic neutrophils directly stimulated ILC3 activation. ILC3-specific deletion of Gpr34, encoding the LysoPS receptor GPR34, or inhibition of downstream PI3K-AKT or ERK suppressed IL-22 production in response to apoptotic neutrophils. Gpr34&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited compromised ILC3 activation and tissue repair during colon injury, and neutrophil depletion abrogated these defects. GPR34 deficiency in ILC3s limited IL-22 production and tissue repair in vivo in settings of colon and skin injury. Thus, GPR34 is an ILC3-expressed damage-sensing receptor that triggers tissue repair upon recognition of dying neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selective inhibition of cullin 3 neddylation through covalent targeting DCN1 protects mice from acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33976147/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) regulate the turnover of approximately 20% of mammalian cellular proteins. Neddylation of individual cullin proteins is essential for the activation of each CRL. We report herein the discovery of DI-1548 and DI-1859 as two potent, selective and covalent DCN1 inhibitors. These inhibitors selectively inhibit neddylation of cullin 3 in cells at low nanomolar concentrations and are 2â3 orders of magnitude more potent than our previously reported reversible DCN1 inhibitor. Mass spectrometric analysis and co-crystal structures reveal that these compounds employ a unique mechanism of covalent bond formation with DCN1. DI-1859 induces a robust increase of NRF2 protein, a CRL3 substrate, in mouse liver and effectively protects mice from acetaminophen-induced liver damage. Taken together, this study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of selective inhibition of cullin neddylation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Perivascular Macrophages Regulate Blood Flow Following Tissue Damage</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33878889/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/33878889/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic injuries remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and restoration of functional blood perfusion is vital to limit tissue damage and support healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reveal a novel role of macrophages in reestablishment of functional tissue perfusion following ischemic injury that can be targeted to improve tissue restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods and Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using intravital microscopy of ischemic hindlimb muscle in mice, and confocal microscopy of human tissues from amputated legs, we found that macrophages accumulated perivascularly in ischemic muscles, where they expressed high levels of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide [NO] synthase). Genetic depletion of iNOS specifically in macrophages (Cx3cr1-CreERT2;Nos2&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt; or LysM-Cre;Nos2&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;) did not affect vascular architecture but highly compromised blood flow regulation in ischemic but not healthy muscle, which resulted in aggravated ischemic damage. Thus, the ability to upregulate blood flow was shifted from eNOS (endothelial)-dependence in healthy muscles to completely rely on macrophage-derived iNOS during ischemia. Macrophages in ischemic muscles expressed high levels of CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4) and CCR2 (C-C chemokine receptor type 2), and local overexpression by DNA plasmids encoding the corresponding chemokines CXCL12 (stromal-derived factor 1) or CCL2 (chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2) increased macrophage numbers, while CXCL12 but not CCL2 induced their perivascular positioning. As a result, CXCL12-overexpression increased the number of perfused blood vessels in the ischemic muscles, improved functional muscle perfusion in a macrophage-iNOS-dependent manner, and ultimately restored limb function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study establishes a new function for macrophages during tissue repair, as they regulate blood flow through the release of iNOS-produced NO. Further, we demonstrate that macrophages can be therapeutically targeted to improve blood flow regulation and functional recovery of ischemic tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aagab acts as a novel regulator of NEDD4-1-mediated Pten nuclear translocation to promote neurological recovery following hypoxic-ischemic brain damage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a main cause of mortality and severe neurologic impairment in the perinatal and neonatal period. However, few satisfactory therapeutic strategies are available. Here, we reported that a rapid nuclear translocation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome TEN (PTEN) is an essential step in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD)- and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neuronal injures both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we found that OGD-induced nuclear translocation of PTEN is dependent on PTEN mono-ubiquitination at the lysine 13 residue (K13) that is mediated by neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 4-1 (NEDD4-1). Importantly, we for the first time identified Î±- and Î³-adaptin binding protein (Aagab) as a novel NEDD4-1 regulator to regulate the level of NEDD4-1, subsequently mediating Pten nuclear translocation. Finally, we demonstrated that genetic upregulation of Aagab or application of Tat-K13 peptide (a short interference peptide that flanks K13 residue of PTEN) not only reduced Pten nuclear translocation, but also significantly alleviated the deficits of myodynamia, motor and spatial learning and memory in HIBD model rats. These results suggest that Aagab may serve as a regulator of NEDD4-1-mediated Pten nuclear translocation to promote functional recovery following HIBD in neonatal rats, and provide a new potential therapeutic target to guide the clinical treatment for HIE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal stem cell-mediated immunomodulation of recruited mononuclear phagocytes during acute lung injury: a high-dimensional analysis study</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI)-recruited mononuclear phagocytes play a pivotal role in lung injury and repair. This study investigated the types of recruited mononuclear phagocytes and the immunotherapeutic effects of allograft mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice were orotracheally instilled with LPS (20 mg/kg). Compact bone-derived MSCs were administered orotracheally 4 h after LPS inhalation. Mononuclear phagocytes recruited in the lung tissues were characterized at different timepoints by high-dimensional analysis including flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Eight mononuclear phagocyte subsets recruited to LPS-challenged lungs were precisely identified. On day 3 after LPS administration, both Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes were recruited into acutely injured lungs, which was associated with increased secretion of neutrophil chemokines. Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes differentiated into M1 macrophages on day 3, and subsequently differentiated into CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) on day 7, while Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes differentiated into CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs on day 7. When ALI mice were treated with MSCs, the mortality significantly reduced. Notably, MSCs reduced the amount of M1 macrophages and reduced the secretion of neutrophil chemokines on day 3. Furthermore, MSCs reduced the number of CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mo-DCs and CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs on day 7, suppressing the antigen presentation process. Recruited mononuclear phagocyte subsets with a high level of CD38 exhibited an activated phenotype and could secrete higher levels of cytokines and chemokines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study characterized the dynamic functions and phenotypes of recruited mononuclear phagocytes in ALI mice and MSC-treated ALI mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The PINK1/PARK2/optineurin pathway of mitophagy is activated for protection in septic acute kidney injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33137712/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is the major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with high mortality rates. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of septic AKI. Mitophagy is an important mitochondrial quality control mechanism that selectively eliminates damaged mitochondria, but its role and regulation in septic AKI remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate the induction of mitophagy in mouse models of septic AKI induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment or by cecal ligation and puncture. Mitophagy was also induced in cultured proximal tubular epithelial cells exposed to LPS. Induction of mitophagy under these experimental setting was suppressed by pink1 or park2 knockout, indicating the role of the PINK1/PARK2 pathway of mitophagy in septic AKI. In addition, sepsis induced more severe kidney injury and cell apoptosis in pink1 or park2 knockout mice than in wild-type mice, suggesting a beneficial role of mitophagy in septic AKI. Furthermore, in cultured renal tubular cells treated with LPS, knockdown of pink1 or park2 inhibited mitochondrial accumulation of the autophagy adaptor optineurin (OPTN) and silencing Optn inhibited LPS-induced mitophagy. Taken together, these findings suggest that the PINK1/PARK2 pathway of mitophagy plays an important role in mitochondrial quality control, tubular cell survival, and renal function in septic AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesenchymal stem cells alleviate LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the proinflammatory function of Ly6C&#43; CD8&#43; T cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systemic inflammatory processes, including alveolar injury, cytokine induction, and neutrophil accumulation, play key roles in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury (ALI). The immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can contribute to the treatment of inflammatory disorders. In previous studies, the focus was on innate immune cells and the effects of MSCs on ALI through CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells remain unclear. In the present study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce ALI in mice. ALI mice were treated with MSCs via intratracheal instillation. Survival rate, histopathological changes, protein levels, total cell count, cytokine levels, and chemokine levels in alveolar lavage fluid were used to determine the efficacy of MSCs. Mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were used to characterize the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the lungs. Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are prevalent in normal mice, whereas a specialized effector phenotype expressing a high level of Ly6C is predominant in advanced disease. MSCs significantly mitigated ALI and improved survival. MSCs decreased the infiltration of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, especially Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells into the lungs. Mass cytometry revealed that CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells expressing high Ly6C and CXCR3 levels caused tissue damage in the lungs of ALI mice, which was alleviated by MSCs. The scRNA-seq showed that Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells exhibited a more activated phenotype and decreased expression of proinflammatory factors that were enriched the most in immune chemotaxis after treatment with MSCs. We showed that CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells play an important role in MSC-mediated ALI remission, and both infiltration quantity and proinflammatory function were inhibited by MSCs, indicating a potential mechanism for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immunosuppressive effects of mesenchymal stem cells on lung B cell gene expression in LPS-induced acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32977837/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Immune system disorders play important roles in acute lung injury (ALI), and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment can reduce inflammation during ALI. In this study, we compared the changes in lung B cells during MSC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We investigated the effects of MSCs on lung B cells in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. MSCs were administered intratracheally 4 h after LPS. As vehicle-treated controls, mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% C57BL/6 (PBS group). Histopathological changes, survival rate, inflammatory factor levels, and the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis was performed to evaluate the transcriptional changes in lung B cells between the PBS, LPS, and LPS/MSC groups on days 3 and 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; MSC treatment ameliorated LPS-induced ALI, as indicated by the reductions in mortality, the levels of chemokines and cytokines in BALF, and the severity of lung tissue histopathology in ALI mice. Lung B cells in the PBS group remained undifferentiated and had an inhibitory phenotype. Based on our scRNA-Seq results, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lung B cells in both the PBS group and LPS group were involved in chemotaxis processes and some proinflammatory pathways. MSC treatment inhibited the expression of chemokine genes that were upregulated by LPS and were related to the recruitment of neutrophils into lung tissues. Immunoglobulin-related gene expression was decreased in lung B cells of mice treated with LPS/MSC for 7 days. The DEGs regulated by MSCs were enriched in biological processes, including humoral immune response and apoptotic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Lung B cells played an important role in the effects of treatment of ALI with MSCs. These observations provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of MSC treatment for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Persistence of a regeneration-associated, transitional alveolar epithelial cell state in pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32661339/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem cells undergo dynamic changes in response to injury to regenerate lost cells. However, the identity of transitional states and the mechanisms that drive their trajectories remain understudied. Using lung organoids, multiple in vivo repair models, single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing, we find that alveolar type-2 epithelial cells undergoing differentiation into type-1 cells acquire pre-alveolar type-1 transitional cell state (PATS) en route to terminal maturation. Transitional cells undergo extensive stretching during differentiation, making them vulnerable to DNA damage. Cells in the PATS show an enrichment of TP53, TGFÎ², DNA-damage-response signalling and cellular senescence. Gain and loss of function as well as genomic binding assays revealed a direct transcriptional control of PATS by TP53 signalling. Notably, accumulation of PATS-like cells in human fibrotic lungs was observed, suggesting persistence of the transitional state in fibrosis. Our study thus implicates a transient state associated with senescence in normal epithelial tissue repair and its abnormal persistence in disease conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decreased Hepatocyte Autophagy Leads to Synergistic IL-1Î² and TNF Mouse Liver Injury and Inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32108953/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background and aims:&lt;/em&gt; The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1Î² has been implicated in the pathophysiology of nonalcoholic and alcoholic steatohepatitis. How IL-1Î² promotes liver injury in these diseases is unclear, as no IL-1Î² receptor-linked death pathway has been identified. Autophagy functions in hepatocyte resistance to injury and death, and findings of decreased hepatic autophagy in many liver diseases suggest a role for impaired autophagy in disease pathogenesis. Recent findings that autophagy blocks mouse liver injury from lipopolysaccharide led to an examination of autophagy&amp;rsquo;s function in hepatotoxicity from proinflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approach and results:&lt;/em&gt; AML12 cells with decreased autophagy from a lentiviral autophagy-related 5 (Atg5) knockdown were resistant to toxicity from TNF, but sensitized to death from IL-1Î², which was markedly amplified by TNF co-treatment. IL-1Î²/TNF death was necrosis by trypan blue and propidium iodide positivity, absence of mitochondrial death pathway and caspase activation, and failure of a caspase inhibitor or necrostatin-1s to prevent death. IL-1Î²/TNF depleted autophagy-deficient cells of ATP, and ATP depletion and cell death were prevented by supplementation with the energy substrate pyruvate or oleate. Pharmacological inhibitors and genetic knockdown studies demonstrated that IL-1Î²/TNF-induced necrosis resulted from lysosomal permeabilization and release of cathepsins B and L in autophagy-deficient cells. Mice with a tamoxifen-inducible, hepatocyte-specific Atg5 knockout were similarly sensitized to cathepsin-dependent hepatocellular injury and death from IL-1Î²/TNF in combination, but neither IL-1Î² nor TNF alone. Knockout mice had increased hepatic inflammation, and IL-1Î²/TNF-treated, autophagy-deficient AML12 cells secreted exosomes with proinflammatory damage-associated molecular patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; The findings delineate mechanisms by which decreased hepatocyte autophagy promotes IL-1Î²/TNF-induced necrosis from impaired energy homeostasis and lysosomal permeabilization and inflammation through the secretion of exosomal damage-associated molecular patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nuclear receptor PXR targets AKR1B7 to protect mitochondrial metabolism and renal function in AKI</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/32404507/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a worldwide public health problem with no specific and satisfactory therapies in clinic. The nuclear pregnane X receptor (PXR) is involved in the progression of multiple diseases, including metabolic diseases, atherosclerosis, hypertension, liver injury, etc. However, its role in kidney injury remains to be understood. In this study, we have investigated the role of PXR in AKI and underlying mechanism(s) involved in its function. PXR was robustly down-regulated and negatively correlated with renal dysfunction in human and animal kidneys with AKI. Silencing PXR in rats enhanced cisplatin-induced AKI and induced severe mitochondrial abnormalities, whereas activating PXR protected against AKI. Using luciferase reporter assays, genomic manipulation, and proteomics data analysis on the kidneys of PXR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; rats, we determined that PXR targeted Aldo-keto reductase family 1, member B7 (AKR1B7) to improve mitochondrial function, thereby ameliorating AKI. We confirmed the protective role of PXR against kidney injury using genomic and pharmacologic approaches in an ischemia/reperfusion model of AKI. These findings demonstrate that disabling the PXR/AKR1B7/mitochondrial metabolism axis is an important factor that can contribute to AKI, whereas reestablishing this axis can be useful for treating AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As extracellular vesicles that play an active role in intercellular communication by transferring cellular materials to recipient cells, exosomes offer great potential as a natural therapeutic drug delivery vehicle. The inflammatory responses in various disease models can be attenuated through introduction of super-repressor IÎºB (srIÎºB), which is the dominant active form of IÎºBÎ± and can inhibit translocation of nuclear factor ÎºB into the nucleus. An optogenetically engineered exosome system (EXPLOR) that we previously developed was implemented for loading a large amount of srIÎºB into exosomes. We showed that intraperitoneal injection of purified srIÎºB-loaded exosomes (Exo-srIÎºBs) attenuates mortality and systemic inflammation in septic mouse models. In a biodistribution study, Exo-srIÎºBs were observed mainly in the neutrophils, and in monocytes to a lesser extent, in the spleens and livers of mice. Moreover, we found that Exo-srIÎºB alleviates inflammatory responses in monocytic THP-1 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colonic epithelium can undergo multiple rounds of damage and repair, often in response to excessive inflammation. The responsive stem cell that mediates this process is unclear, in part because of a lack of in vitro models that recapitulate key epithelial changes that occur in vivo during damage and repair. Here, we identify a Hopx&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; colitis-associated regenerative stem cell (CARSC) population that functionally contributes to mucosal repair in mouse models of colitis. Hopx&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CARSCs, enriched for fetal-like markers, transiently arose from hypertrophic crypts known to facilitate regeneration. Importantly, we established a long-term, self-organizing two-dimensional (2D) epithelial monolayer system to model the regenerative properties and responses of Hopx&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CARSCs. This system can reenact the &amp;ldquo;homeostasis-injury-regeneration&amp;rdquo; cycles of epithelial alterations that occur in vivo. Using this system, we found that hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum stress, insults commonly present in inflammatory bowel diseases, mediated the cyclic switch of cellular status in this process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting Degradation of the Transcription Factor C/EBPÎ² Reduces Lung Fibrosis by Restoring Activity of the Ubiquitin-Editing Enzyme A20 in Macrophages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although recent progress provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), rare anti-PF therapeutics show definitive promise for treating this disease. Repeated lung epithelial injury results in injury-repairing response and inflammation, which drive the development of PF. Here, we report that chronic lung injury inactivated the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, causing progressive accumulation of the transcription factor C/EBPÎ² in alveolar macrophages (AMs) from PF patients and mice, which upregulated a number of immunosuppressive and profibrotic factors promoting PF development. In response to chronic lung injury, elevated glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) interacted with and phosphorylated A20 to suppress C/EBPÎ² degradation. Ectopic expression of A20 or pharmacological restoration of A20 activity by disturbing the A20-GSK-3Î² interaction accelerated C/EBPÎ² degradation and showed potent therapeutic efficacy against experimental PF. Our study indicates that a regulatory mechanism of the GSK-3Î²-A20-C/EBPÎ² axis in AMs may be a potential target for treating PF and fibroproliferative lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tolerogenic signaling of alveolar macrophages induces lung adaptation to oxidative injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31356919/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Inhaled oxidative toxicants present in ambient air cause airway epithelial injury, inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Effective adaptation to such environmental insults is essential for the preservation of pulmonary function, whereas failure or incomplete adaptation to oxidative injury can render the host susceptible to the development of airway disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; We sought to explore the mechanisms of airway adaptation to oxidative injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; For a model to study pulmonary adaptation to oxidative stress-induced lung injury, we exposed mice to repeated nose-only chlorine gas exposures. Outcome measures were evaluated 24 hours after the last chlorine exposure. Lung mechanics and airway responsiveness to methacholine were assessed by using the flexiVent. Inflammation and antioxidant responses were assessed in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue. Using both loss or gain of function and genomic approaches, we further dissected the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in pulmonary adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Repeated exposures to oxidative stress resulted in pulmonary adaptation evidenced by abrogation of neutrophilic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. This adaptation was independent of antioxidant mechanisms and regulatory T cells but dependent on residential alveolar macrophages (AMs). Interestingly, 5% of AMs expressed forkhead box P3, and depletion of these cells abolished adaptation. Results from transcriptomic profiling and loss and gain of function suggest that adaptation might be dependent on TGF-Î² and prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Pulmonary adaptation during oxidative stress-induced lung injury is mediated by a novel subset of forkhead box P3-positive AMs that limits inflammation, favoring airway adaptation and host fitness through TGF-Î² and prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gata6&#43; Pericardial Cavity Macrophages Relocate to the Injured Heart and Prevent Cardiac Fibrosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophages play an important role in structural cardiac remodeling and the transition to heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI). Previous research has focused on the impact of blood-derived monocytes on cardiac repair. Here we examined the contribution of resident cavity macrophages located in the pericardial space adjacent to the site of injury. We found that disruption of the pericardial cavity accelerated maladaptive post-MI cardiac remodeling. Gata6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages in mouse pericardial fluid contributed to the reparative immune response. Following experimental MI, these macrophages invaded the epicardium and lost Gata6 expression but continued to perform anti-fibrotic functions. Loss of this specialized macrophage population enhanced interstitial fibrosis after ischemic injury. Gata6+ macrophages were present in human pericardial fluid, supporting the notion that this reparative function is relevant in human disease. Our findings uncover an immune cardioprotective role for the pericardial tissue compartment and argue for the reevaluation of surgical procedures that remove the pericardium.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>S100a8/a9 Signaling Causes Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Cardiomyocyte Death in Response to Ischemic/Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/31220942/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury is a significant clinical problem without effective therapy. Unbiased omics approaches may reveal key MI/R mediators to initiate MI/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We used a dynamic transcriptome analysis of mouse heart exposed to various MI/R periods to identify S100a8/a9 as an early mediator. Using loss/gain-of-function approaches to understand the role of S100a8/a9 in MI/R injury, we explored the mechanisms through transcriptome and functional experiment. Dynamic serum S100a8/a9 levels were measured in patients with acute myocardial infarction before and after percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were prospectively followed for the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; S100a8/a9 was identified as the most significantly upregulated gene during the early reperfusion stage. Knockout of S100a9 markedly decreased cardiomyocyte death and improved heart function, whereas hematopoietic overexpression of S100a9 exacerbated MI/R injury. Transcriptome/functional studies revealed that S100a8/a9 caused mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction in cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, S100a8/a9 downregulated NDUF gene expression with subsequent mitochondrial complex I inhibition via Toll-like receptor 4/Erk-mediated Pparg coactivator 1 alpha/nuclear respiratory factor 1 signaling suppression. Administration of S100a9 neutralizing antibody significantly reduced MI/R injury and improved cardiac function. Finally, we demonstrated that serum S100a8/a9 levels were significantly increased 1 day after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute myocardial infarction, and elevated S100a8/a9 levels were associated with the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Our study identified S100a8/a9 as a master regulator causing cardiomyocyte death in the early stage of MI/R injury via the suppression of mitochondrial function. Targeting S100a8/a9-intiated signaling may represent a novel therapeutic intervention against MI/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Erratum in:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corrigendum to Zhao Y, Wang C, Hong X, et al. &lt;a href=&#34;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0085253822006226&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling mediates both heart and kidney injury in type 2 cardiorenal syndrome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kidney Int. 2019;95:815-829.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In type 2 cardiorenal syndrome, chronic heart failure is thought to cause or promote chronic kidney disease; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the role of Wnt signaling in heart and kidney injury in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). At 8 weeks after TAC, cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis were prominent, and echocardiography confirmed impaired cardiac function. The cardiac lesions were accompanied by upregulation of multiple Wnt ligands and activation of Î²-catenin, as well as activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Wnt3a induced multiple components of the RAS in primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. TAC also caused proteinuria and kidney fibrosis, accompanied by klotho depletion and Î²-catenin activation in the kidney. Pharmacologic blockade of Î²-catenin with a small molecule inhibitor or the RAS with losartan ameliorated cardiac injury, restored heart function, and mitigated the renal lesions. Serum from TAC mice was sufficient to activate Î²-catenin and trigger tubular cell injury in vitro, indicating a role for circulating factors. Multiple inflammatory cytokines were upregulated in the circulation of TAC mice, and tumor necrosis factor-Î± was able to inhibit klotho, induce Î²-catenin activation, and cause tubular cell injury in vitro. These studies identify Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling as a common pathogenic mediator of heart and kidney injury in type 2 cardiorenal syndrome after TAC. Targeting this pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy to protect both organs in cardiorenal syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Endotoxin Delivery Protein HMGB1 Mediates Caspase-11-Dependent Lethality in Sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/30314759/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hepatocyte-released HMGB1 mediates caspase-11-dependent lethality in sepsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HMGB1-LPS complexes are taken up by macrophages and endothelial cells via RAGE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HMGB1 destabilizes phagolysosomes for the transfer of LPS to cytosolic caspase-11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neutralizing extracellular HMGB1 inhibits caspase-11 activation in sepsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caspase-11, a cytosolic endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide: LPS) receptor, mediates pyroptosis, a lytic form of cell death. Caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis mediates lethality in endotoxemia, but it is unclear how LPS is delivered into the cytosol for the activation of caspase-11. Here we discovered that hepatocyte-released high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was required for caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and lethality in endotoxemia and bacterial sepsis. Mechanistically, hepatocyte-released HMGB1 bound LPS and targeted its internalization into the lysosomes of macrophages and endothelial cells via the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). Subsequently, HMGB1 permeabilized the phospholipid bilayer in the acidic environment of lysosomes. This resulted in LPS leakage into the cytosol and caspase-11 activation. Depletion of hepatocyte HMGB1, inhibition of hepatocyte HMGB1 release, neutralizing extracellular HMGB1, or RAGE deficiency prevented caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and death in endotoxemia and bacterial sepsis. These findings indicate that HMGB1 interacts with LPS to mediate caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis in lethal sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
