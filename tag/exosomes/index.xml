      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophage/microglia polarization acts as an important part in regulating inflammatory responses in spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the regulation of inflammation of Schwann cell-derived exosomes (SCDEs) for SCI repair is still unclear. Therefore, we intend to find out the effect of SCDEs on regulating the inflammation related to macrophage polarization during the recovery of SCI. Firstly, the thesis demonstrated that SCDEs could attenuate the LPS- inflammation in BMDMs by suppressing M1 polarization and stimulating M2 polarization. Similarly, SCDEs improved functional recovery of female Wistar rats of the SCI contusion model according to BBB (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan) score, electrophysiological assay, and the gait analysis system of CatWalk XT. Moreover, MFG-E8 was verified as the main component of SCDEs to improve the inflammatory response by proteomic sequencing and lentiviral transfection. Improvement of the inflammatory microenvironment also inhibited neuronal apoptosis. The knockout of MFG-E8 in SCs can reverse the anti-inflammatory effects of SCDEs treatment. The SOCS3/STAT3 signaling pathway was identified to participate in upregulating M2 polarization induced by MFG-E8. In conclusion, our findings will enrich the mechanism of SCDEs in repairing SCI and provide potential applications and new insights for the clinical translation of SCDEs treatment for SCI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Effective Peptide-Based Platform for Efficient Exosomal Loading and Cellular Delivery of a microRNA</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36638205/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes, membrane-bound nanosized vesicles of biologic origin, are known to contain various molecules, e.g., proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which contribute to the exosomes&amp;rsquo; ability to mediate cell-to-cell communication. Recent impediments of artificial nanoparticles in drug delivery, including low cellular uptake, activation of the immune system, and tissue obstacles, have led scientists to engineer exosomes as drug delivery vehicles. Though exosomes possess inherent properties of stability, biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and capability to cross biological barriers, there is a need to develop technologies that allow the efficient loading of therapeutic materials into exosomes. Here, we introduced a simple peptide-equipped technology that can enhance the cargo-loading potential of exosomes in a mild loading environment. Specifically, a known cell-penetrating peptide, YARA, derived from human immunodeficiency virus-1 trans-activator of transcription, was covalently conjugated with miR-21-5p, a mammalian microRNA. The conjugate YARA-miR-21-5p was then incubated with exosomes, isolated from either mesenchymal stem cells or cancer cells, for loading. Exosomal loading of YARA-miR-21-5p was time-dependent and demonstrated an impressive 18.6-fold increase in efficiency over exosomal loading of miR-21-5p through incubation. After effective cellular uptake, the loaded exosomes rapidly delivered YARA-miR-21-5p into mammalian cells. Relative to unloaded exosomes and free YARA-miR-21-5p, the loaded exosomes significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human and mouse fibroblasts, which are vital steps in wound healing. This study lays the groundwork for using cell-penetrating peptides as an innovative approach to efficiently load therapeutic cargos, e.g., microRNAs, into exosomes, which can then be employed to deliver the cargos into cells to yield biological effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single Molecule Localization Microscopy for Studying Small Extracellular Vesicles</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36635058/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are 30-200 nm nanovesicles enriched with unique cargoes of nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins. sEVs are released by all cell types and have emerged as a critical mediator of cell-to-cell communication. Although many studies have dealt with the role of sEVs in health and disease, the exact mechanism of sEVs biogenesis and uptake remain unexplored due to the lack of suitable imaging technologies. For sEVs functional studies, imaging has long relied on conventional fluorescence microscopy that has only 200-300 nm resolution, thereby generating blurred images. To break this resolution limit, recent developments in super-resolution microscopy techniques, specifically single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), expanded the understanding of subcellular details at the few nanometer level. SMLM success relies on the use of appropriate fluorophores with excellent blinking properties. In this review, the basic principle of SMLM is highlighted and the state of the art of SMLM use in sEV biology is summarized. Next, how SMLM techniques implemented for cell imaging can be translated to sEV imaging is discussed by applying different labeling strategies to study sEV biogenesis and their biomolecular interaction with the distant recipient cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Endothelial cell-derived exosomes boost and maintain repair-related phenotypes of Schwann cells via miR199-5p to promote nerve regeneration</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36624511/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36624511/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Schwann cells (SCs) respond to nerve injury by transforming into the repair-related cell phenotype, which can provide the essential signals and spatial cues to promote axonal regeneration and induce target reinnervation. Endothelial cells (ECs) contribute to intraneural angiogenesis contributing to creating a permissive microenvironment. The coordination between ECs and SCs within injury sites is crucial in the regeneration process, however, it still unclear. As the intercellular vital information mediators in the nervous system, exosomes have been proposed to take a significant role in regulating regeneration. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to determine the facilitative effect of ECs-derived exosomes on SCs and to seek the underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In the present study, we collected exosomes from media of ECs. We demonstrated that exosomes derived from ECs possessed the favorable neuronal affinity both in vitro and in vivo. Further research indicated that EC-exosomes (EC-EXO) could boost and maintain repair-related phenotypes of SCs, thereby enhancing axonal regeneration, myelination of regenerated axons and neurologically functional recovery of the injured nerve. MiRNA sequencing in EXO-treated SCs and control SCs indicated that EC-EXO significantly up-regulated expression of miR199-5p. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that EC-EXO drove the conversion of SC phenotypes in a PI3K/AKT/PTEN-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; In conclusion, our research indicates that the internalization of EC-EXO in SCs can promote nerve regeneration by boosting and maintaining the repair-related phenotypes of SCs. And the mechanism may be relevant to the up-regulated expression of miR199-5p and activation of PI3K/AKT/PTEN signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomal miR-27b-3p secreted by visceral adipocytes contributes to endothelial inflammation and atherogenesis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36640325/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obesity increases the level of exosomal miR-27b-3p in gonadal fat and plasma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;miR-27b-3p promote endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis in vitro and in vivo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CDS region of PPARα is the miRNA-recognition elements of miR-27b-3p&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity, particularly increased visceral fat, positively correlates with various metabolic challenges, including atherosclerosis, but the mechanism is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to determine the role of visceral-fat-derived exosomes (Exo) in endothelial cells and atherosclerosis. We show that obesity changes the miRNA profile of visceral adipose exosomes in mice. Importantly, exosomal miR-27b-3p efficiently enters into the vascular endothelial cells and activates the NF-κB pathway by downregulating PPARα. Mechanistically, miR-27b-3p binds directly to the CDS region of PPARα mRNA, thereby promoting mRNA degradation and suppressing translation. In ApoE-deficient mice, administration of miR-27b-3p mimic increases inflammation and atherogenesis, while overexpression of PPARα protects against atherosclerosis. Thus, obesity-induced exosomal miR-27b-3p promotes endothelial inflammation and facilitates atherogenesis by PPARα suppression. We reveal an exosomal pathway by which obesity aggravates atherosclerosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis in people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD44-targeting Drug Delivery System of Exosomes Loading Forsythiaside A Combats Liver Fibrosis via Regulating NLRP3-mediated Pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36603210/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver fibrosis is a progressive pathological process induced by various stimuli and may progress to liver cirrhosis and cancer. Forsythiaside A (FA) is an active ingredient extracted from traditional Chinese medicine Forsythiae Fructus and has prominent hepatoprotective activities. However, the unsatisfactory pharmacokinetic properties restrict its clinical application. In this study, the nanocarrier of CD44-specific ligand Hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified milk-derived exosomes (mExo) encapsulated with FA (HA-mExo-FA) is developed. As a result, HA modification could deliver drug-loaded exosomes to the target cells and form a specific ligand-receptor interaction with CD44, thus improving the anti-liver fibrosis effect of FA. In vitro findings indicate that HA-mExo-FA could inhibit TGF-β1-induced LX2 cell proliferation, reduce α-SMA and collagen gene and protein levels, and promote the apoptosis of activated LX2 cells. In vivo results demonstrate that HA-mExo-FA could improve liver morphology and function changes in zebrafish larvae. The anti-liver fibrosis mechanism of HA-mExo-FA may be attributed to the inhibition of NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis. In addition, the effect of HA-mExo-FA on TAA-induced increase in NLRP3 production is attenuated by NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950. Collectively, this study demonstrates the promising application of HA-mExo-FA in drug delivery with high specificity and provides a powerful and novel delivery platform for liver fibrosis therapy.

      <title>Tea leaf-derived exosome-like nanotherapeutics retard breast tumor growth by pro-apoptosis and microbiota modulation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36600299/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While several artificial nanodrugs have been approved for clinical treatment of breast tumor, their long-term applications are restricted by unsatisfactory therapeutic outcomes, side reactions and high costs. Conversely, edible plant-derived natural nanotherapeutics (NTs) are source-widespread and cost-effective, which have been shown remarkably effective in disease treatment. Herein, we extracted and purified exosome-like NTs from tea leaves (TLNTs), which had an average diameter of 166.9 nm and a negative-charged surface of - 28.8 mV. These TLNTs contained an adequate slew of functional components such as lipids, proteins and pharmacologically active molecules. In vitro studies indicated that TLNTs were effectively internalized by breast tumor cells (4T1 cells) and caused a 2.5-fold increase in the amount of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) after incubation for 8 h. The high levels of ROS triggered mitochondrial damages and arrested cell cycles, resulting in the apoptosis of tumor cells. The mouse experiments revealed that TLNTs achieved good therapeutic effects against breast tumors regardless of intravenous injection and oral administration through direct pro-apoptosis and microbiota modulation. Strikingly, the intravenous injection of TLNTs, not oral administration, yielded obvious hepatorenal toxicity and immune activation. These findings collectively demonstrate that TLNTs can be developed as a promising oral therapeutic platform for the treatment of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomal LOC85009 inhibits docetaxel resistance in lung adenocarcinoma through regulating ATG5-induced autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36641841/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; This study aims at investigating the role of a neighbor long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) of HDAC4 (LOC85009) in docetaxel (DTX) resistance of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; RT-qPCR was used to analyze LOC85009 expression in DTX-resistant LUAD cells. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments were applied to detect the influence of LOC85009 on LUAD cell growth and xenograft tumor growth. DNA pull down assay, RNA pull down assay, ChIP assay, CoIP assay and RIP assay were performed to identify the direct interactions between factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; LOC85009 was lowly-expressed in DTX-resistant LUAD cells. Functionally, LOC85009 overexpression inhibited DTX resistance and cell proliferation but triggered cell apoptosis. Moreover, we identified that LOC85009 was transferred from LUAD cells to DTX-resistant LUAD cells via exosomes. Exosomal LOC85009 inhibited DTX resistance, proliferation and autophagy while induced apoptosis in DTX-resistant cells. Additionally, we found that LOC85009 sequestered ubiquitin-specific proteinase 5 (USP5) to destabilize upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) protein, thereby inactivating ATG5 transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; Exosomal LOC85009 inhibits DTX resistance through regulation of ATG5-induced autophagy via USP5/USF1 axis, suggesting that LOC85009 might be a potential target to reverse DTX resistance in the treatment of LUAD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes are endosome-derived nanovesicles involved in cellular communication. They are natural nanocarriers secreted by various cells, making them suitable candidates for diverse drug delivery and therapeutic applications from a material standpoint. They have a phospholipid bilayer decorated with functional molecules and an enclosed parental matrix, which has attracted interest in developing designer/hybrid engineered exosome nanocarriers. The structural versatility of exosomes allows the modification of their original configuration using various methods, including genetic engineering, chemical procedures, physical techniques, and microfluidic technology, to load exosomes with additional cargo for expanded biomedical applications. Exosomes show enormous potential for overcoming the limitations of conventional nanoparticle-based techniques in targeted therapy. This review highlights the exosome sources, characteristics, state of the art in the field of hybrid exosomes, exosome-like nanovesicles and engineered exosomes as potential cargo delivery vehicles for therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomes as biomarkers and therapeutic delivery for autoimmune diseases: Opportunities and challenges</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes are spherical lipid bilayer vesicles composed of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids that deliver signaling molecules through a vesicular transport system to regulate the function and morphology of target cells, thereby involving in a variety of biological processes, such as cell apoptosis or proliferation, and cytokine production. In the past decades, there are emerging evidence that exosomes play pivotal roles in the pathological mechanisms of several autoimmune diseases (ADs), including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), Sjogren&amp;rsquo;s syndrome (SS), multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). systemic sclerosis (SSc), etc. Several publications have shown that exosomes are involved in the pathogenesis of ADs mainly through intercellular communication and by influencing the response of immune cells. The level of exosomes and the expression of nucleic acids can reflect the degree of disease progression and are excellent biomarkers for ADs. In addition, exosomes have the potential to be used as drug carriers thanks to their biocompatibility and stability. In this review, we briefly summarized the current researches regarding the biological functions of exosomes in ADs, and provided an insight into the potential of exosomes as biomarkers and therapeutic delivery for these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Small extracellular vesicles in metabolic remodeling of tumor cells: Cargos and translational application</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warburg effect is characterized by excessive consumption of glucose by the tumor cells under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions. This metabolic reprogramming allows the tumor cells to adapt to the unique microenvironment and proliferate rapidly, and also promotes tumor metastasis and therapy resistance. Metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells is driven by the aberrant expression and activity of metabolic enzymes, which results in the accumulation of oncometabolites, and the hyperactivation of intracellular growth signals. Recent studies suggest that tumor-associated metabolic remodeling also depends on intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), also known as exosomes, are smaller than 200 nm in diameter and are formed by the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. The sEVs are instrumental in transporting cargoes such as proteins, nucleic acids or metabolites between the tumor, stromal and immune cells of the TME, and are thus involved in reprogramming the glucose metabolism of recipient cells. In this review, we have summarized the biogenesis and functions of sEVs and metabolic cargos, and the mechanisms through they drive the Warburg effect. Furthermore, the potential applications of targeting sEV-mediated metabolic pathways in tumor liquid biopsy, imaging diagnosis and drug development have also been discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resveratrol-loaded macrophage exosomes alleviate multiple sclerosis through targeting microglia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite exosome promise as endogenous drug delivery vehicles, the current understanding of exosome may be insufficient to develop their various applications. Here we synthesized five sialic acid analogues with different length N-acyl side chains and screened out the optimal metabolic precursor for exosome labeling via bio-orthogonal click chemistry. In proof-of-principle labeling experiments, exosomes derived from macrophages (RAW-Exo) strongly co-localized with central nervous system (CNS) microglia. Inspired by this discovery, we developed a resveratrol-loaded RAW-Exo formulation (RSV&amp;amp;Exo) for multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment. Intranasal administration of RSV&amp;amp;Exo significantly inhibited inflammatory responses in the CNS and peripheral system in a mouse model of MS and effectively improved the clinical evolution of MS in vivo. These findings suggested the feasibility and efficacy of engineered RSV&amp;amp;Exo administration for MS, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomal miR-532-5p induced by long-term exercise rescues blood-brain barrier function in 5XFAD mice via downregulation of EPHA4</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36494892/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, which develops early in Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), contributes to cognitive impairment. Exercise not only reduces the risk factors for AD but also confers direct protection against cognitive decline. However, the exact molecular mechanisms remain elusive, particularly whether exercise can liberate the function of the blood-brain barrier. Here, we demonstrate that long-term exercise promotes the clearance of brain amyloid-β by improving the function of the blood-brain barrier in 5XFAD mice. Significantly, treating primary brain pericytes or endothelial cells with exosomes isolated from the brain of exercised 5XFAD mice improves cell proliferation and upregulates PDGFRβ, ZO-1, and claudin-5. Moreover, exosomes isolated from exercised mice exhibit significant changes in miR-532-5p. Administration or transfection of miR-532-5p to sedentary mice or primary brain pericytes and endothelial cells reproduces the improvement of blood-brain barrier function. Exosomal miR-532-5p targets EPHA4, and accordingly, expression of EphA4 is decreased in exercised mice and miR-532-5p overexpressed mice. A specific siRNA targeting EPHA4 recapitulates the effects on blood-brain barrier-associated cells observed in exercised 5XFAD mice. Overall, our findings suggest that exosomes released by the brain contain a specific miRNA that is altered by exercise and has an impact on blood-brain barrier function in AD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomal noncoding RNAs in central nervous system diseases: biological functions and potential clinical applications</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36438184/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central nervous system (CNS) disease is a general term for a series of complex and diverse diseases, including Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), CNS tumors, stroke, epilepsy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Interneuron and neuron-glia cells communicate with each other through their homeostatic microenvironment. Exosomes in the microenvironment have crucial impacts on interneuron and neuron-glia cells by transferring their contents, such as proteins, lipids, and ncRNAs, constituting a novel form of cell-to-cell interaction and communication. Exosomal noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), regulate physiological functions and maintain CNS homeostasis. Exosomes are regarded as extracellular messengers that transfer ncRNAs between neurons and body fluids due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of exosomal ncRNAs in CNS diseases, including prospective diagnostic biomarkers, pathological regulators, therapeutic strategies and clinical applications. We also provide an all-sided discussion of the comparison with some similar CNS diseases and the main limitations and challenges for exosomal ncRNAs in clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Suppression of PD-L1 release from small extracellular vesicles promotes systemic anti-tumor immunity by targeting ORAI1 calcium channels</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36482876/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockade of immune checkpoints as a strategy of cancer cells to overcome the immune response has received ample attention in cancer research recently. In particular, expression of PD-L1 by various cancer cells has become a paradigm in this respect. Delivery of PD-L1 to its site of action occurs either by local diffusion, or else by transport via small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, commonly referred to as exosomes). Many steps of sEVs formation, their packaging with PD-L1 and their release into the extracellular space have been studied in detail. The likely dependence of release on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signaling, however, has received little attention. This is surprising, since the intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-concentration is known as a prominent regulator of many secretory processes. Here, we report on the roles of three Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent proteins in regulating release of PD-L1-containing sEVs, as well as on the growth of tumors in mouse models. We show that sEVs release in cancer cell lines is Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent and the knockdown of the gene coding the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel protein ORAI1 reduces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signals and release of sEVs. Consequently, the T cell response is reinvigorated and tumor progression in mouse models is retarded. Furthermore, analysis of protein expression patterns in samples from human cancer tissue shows that the ORAI1 gene is significantly upregulated. Such upregulation is identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor for survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We show that reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signaling after knockdown of ORAI1 gene also compromises the activity of melanophilin and Synaptotagmin-like protein 2, two proteins, which are important for correct localization of secretory organelles within cancer cells and their transport to sites of exocytosis. Thus, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel ORAI1 and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent proteins of the secretion pathway emerge as important targets for understanding and manipulating immune checkpoint blockade by PD-L1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarcoma is a group of rare and heterogeneous mesenchymal tumors, prone to late diagnosis and poor prognosis. Exosomes are cell-derived small extracellular vesicles found in most body fluids and contain nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and other molecules. Qualitative and quantitative changes of exosomes and the contents are associated with sarcoma progression, exhibiting their potential as biomarkers. Exosomes possess the capacity of evading immune responses, bioactivity for trafficking, tumor tropism, and lesion residence. Thus, exosomes could be engineered as tumor-specific vehicles in drugs and RNA delivery systems. Exosomes might also serve as therapeutic targets in targeted therapy and immunotherapy and be involved in chemotherapy resistance. Here, we provide a comprehensive summary of exosome applications in liquid biopsy-based diagnosis and explore their implications in the delivery system, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy resistance of sarcoma. Moreover, challenges in exosome clinical applications are raised and some future research directions are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Injectable MMP1-sensitive microspheres with spatiotemporally controlled exosome release promote neovascularized bone healing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36481504/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exos) can recruit stem cells for bone repair, with neovessels serving as the main migratory channel for stem cells to the injury site. However, existing exosome (Exo) delivery strategies cannot reach the angiogenesis phase following bone injury. To that end, an enzyme-sensitive Exo delivery material that responds to neovessel formation during the angiogenesis phase was designed in the present study to achieve spatiotemporally controlled Exo release. Herein, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) was found to be highly expressed in neovascularized bone; as a result, we proposed an injectable MMP1-sensitive hydrogel microspheres (KGE) made using a microfluidic chip prepared by mixing self-assembling peptide (KLDL-MMP1), GelMA, and BMSC-Exos. The results revealed that KGE microspheres had a uniform diameter of 50-70 μm, ideal for minimally invasive injection and could release exosomes in response to MMP1 expression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that KGE had less cytotoxicity and could promote the migration and osteodifferentiation of BMSCs. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that KGE could promote bone repair during angiogenesis by recruiting CD90+ stem cells via neovessels. Collectively, our results suggest that injectable enzyme-responsive KGE microspheres could be a promising Exo-secreting material for accelerating neovascularized bone healing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Exosomes can spread through blood vessels and activate stem cells to participate in bone repair, but under normal circumstances, exosomes lacking sustained-release delivery materials cannot be maintained until the angiogenesis phase. In this study, we found that MMP1 was highly expressed in neovascularized bone, then we proposed an MMP1-sensitive injectable microsphere that carries exosomes and responds temporally and spatially to neovascularization, which maximizes the ability of exosomes to recruit stem cells. Different from previous strategies that focus on promoting angiogenesis to accelerate bone healing, this is a brand new delivery strategy that is stimuli-responsive to neovessel formation. In addition, the preparation of self-assembled peptide microspheres by a microfluidic chip is also proposed for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CD44 promotes angiogenesis in myocardial infarction through regulating plasma exosome uptake and further enhancing FGFR2 signaling transduction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463112/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36463112/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since angiogenesis occurs as the pathological process following myocardial infarction to alleviate ischemia, therapeutic angiogenesis has been proposed to be a cardioprotective strategy. CD44 has been implicated in endothelial cell functions and its role has been well established in angiogenesis for years. Although recent studies indicate the close correlation between CD44 and exosome, as well as the two being implicated in myocardial ischemia pathological processes, the effect and the underlying mechanism of CD44 and its regulated plasma exosome in pathological angiogenesis post-myocardial infarction have not been fully elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we used CD44 knockout mice to study the in vivo impacts of CD44 on ischemic angiogenesis in myocardial infarction. Mouse cardiac function was measured by echocardiography, histological changes were observed by Evans Blue and TTC-double staining and Masson’s trichrome staining, and molecular changes were detected by immunofluorescence. In the in vitro study, CD44 knockout HUVECs were generated and CD44 inhibitor was used to study the mechanism of CD44 on angiogenesis. We performed the immunoprecipitation, proximity ligation assay, and super-resolution imaging to study the mechanistic regulation of FGFR2 signaling transduction by CD44. Importantly, we also isolated plasma exosomes from myocardial infarction model mice and studied the effect of plasma exosomes on the activation of the FGFR2 signaling pathway and the related phenotypic alterations, including exosomes uptake and angiogenic function in primary mouse microvascular endothelial cells, and further discovered the regulation mechanism of exosomal miRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed that the expression of CD44 in the border zone of the infarcted heart was tightly related to pathological angiogenesis following myocardial ischemia. The depletion of CD44 impaired angiogenesis and impacts biogenesis and proangiogenic function of plasma exosomes. Subsequently, we found that CD44 mediated the activation of the FGFR2 signaling pathway as well as the caveolin 1-dependent uptake of exosomes in vascular endothelial cells. Most importantly, the proangiogenic therapeutic effect of plasma exosomal miRNAs depended upon the participation of CD44/FGFR2 signaling transduction in vascular endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD44 and its regulated plasma exosomes have crucial potent angiogenic activity. Our studies elucidate that CD44 plays a key role in plasma exosomal miRNA-enhanced angiogenic FGFR2 singling transduction and ischemic angiogenesis in the early stage of myocardial infarction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical translation of messenger mRNA (mRNA)-based therapeutics requires safe and effective delivery systems. Although considerable progress has been made on the development of mRNA delivery systems, many challenges, such as the dose-limiting toxicity and specific delivery to extrahepatic tissues, still remain. Cell-derived vesicles, a type of endogenous membranous particle secreted from living cells, can be leveraged to load mRNA during or after their biogenesis. Currently, they have received increasing interest for mRNA delivery due to their natural origin, good biocompatibility, cell-specific tropism, and unique ability to cross physiological barriers. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in the naturally occurring mRNA delivery platforms and their biomedical applications. Furthermore, the future perspectives on clinical translation of cell-derived vesicles have been discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are naturally released membrane vesicles that act as carriers of proteins and RNAs for intercellular communication. With various biomolecules and specific ligands, EV has represented a novel form of information transfer, which possesses extremely outstanding efficiency and specificity compared to the classical signal transduction. In addition, EV has extended the concept of signal transduction to intercellular aspect by working as the collection of extracellular information. Therefore, the functions of EVs have been extensively characterized and EVs exhibit an exciting prospect for clinical applications. However, the biogenesis of EVs and, in particular, the regulation of this process by extracellular signals, which are essential to conduct further studies and support optimal utility, remain unclear. Here, we review the current understanding of the biogenesis of EVs, focus on the regulation of this process by extracellular signals and discuss their therapeutic value.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Renal Endothelial Cell-Targeted Extracellular Vesicles Protect the Kidney from Ischemic Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endothelial cell injury plays a critical part in ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) and participates in the progression of AKI. Targeting renal endothelial cell therapy may ameliorate vascular injury and further improve the prognosis of ischemic AKI. Here, P-selectin as a biomarker of ischemic AKI in endothelial cells is identified and P-selectin binding peptide (PBP)-engineered extracellular vesicles (PBP-EVs) with imaging and therapeutic functions are developed. The results show that PBP-EVs exhibit a selective targeting tendency to injured kidneys, while providing spatiotemporal information for the early diagnosis of AKI by quantifying the expression of P-selectin in the kidneys by molecular imaging. Meanwhile, PBP-EVs reveal superior nephroprotective functions in the promotion of renal repair and inhibition of fibrosis by alleviating inflammatory infiltration, improving reparative angiogenesis, and ameliorating maladaptive repair of the renal parenchyma. In conclusion, PBP-EVs, as an ischemic AKI theranostic system that is designed in this study, provide a spatiotemporal diagnosis in the early stages of AKI to help guide personalized therapy and exhibit superior nephroprotective effects, offering proof-of-concept data to design EV-based theranostic strategies to promote renal recovery and further improve long-term outcomes following AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Do Extracellular Vesicles Play a Key Role in the Maintenance of Bone Homeostasis and Regeneration? A Comprehensive Review of Literature</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36419718/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maintenance of bone homeostasis includes both bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. These two processes are in dynamic balance to maintain a constant amount of bone for accomplishing its critical functions in daily life. Multiple cell type communications are involved in these two complex and continuous processes. In recent decades, an increasing number of studies have shown that osteogenic and osteoclastic extracellular vesicles play crucial roles in regulating bone homeostasis through paracrine, autosecretory and endocrine signaling. Elucidating the functional roles of extracellular vesicles in the maintenance of bone homeostasis may contribute to the design of new strategies for bone regeneration. Hence, we review the recent understandings of the classification, production process, extraction methods, structure, contents, functions and applications of extracellular vesicles in bone homeostasis. We highlight the contents of various bone-derived extracellular vesicles and their interactions with different cells in the bone microenvironment during bone homeostasis. We also summarize the recent advances in EV-loaded biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have increasingly been recognized as important cell surrogates influencing many pathophysiological processes, including cellular homeostasis, cancer progression, neurologic disease, and infectious disease. These behaviors enable EVs broad application prospects for clinical application in disease diagnosis and treatment. Many studies suggest that EVs are superior to conventional synthetic carriers in terms of drug delivery and circulating biomarkers for early disease diagnosis, opening up new frontiers for modern theranostics. Despite these clinical potential, EVs containing diverse cellular components, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites are highly heterogeneous and small size. The limitation of preparatory, engineering and analytical technologies for EVs poses technical barriers to clinical translation. This article aims at present a critical overview of emerging technologies in EVs field for biomedical applications and challenges involved in their clinic translations. The current methods for isolation and identification of EVs are discussed. Additionally, engineering strategies developed to enhance scalable production and improved cargo loading as well as tumor targeting are presented. The superior clinical potential of EVs, particularly in terms of different cell origins and their application in the next generation of diagnostic and treatment platforms, are clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomes─Nature&#39;s Lipid Nanoparticles, a Rising Star in Drug Delivery and Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36354238/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes are a subgroup of nanosized extracellular vesicles enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane and secreted by most eukaryotic cells. They represent a route of intercellular communication and participate in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes. The biological roles of exosomes rely on their bioactive cargos, including proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which are delivered to target cells. Their distinctive properties─innate stability, low immunogenicity, biocompatibility, and good biomembrane penetration capacity─allow them to function as superior natural nanocarriers for efficient drug delivery. Another notably favorable clinical application of exosomes is in diagnostics. They hold various biomolecules from host cells, which are indicative of pathophysiological conditions; therefore, they are considered vital for biomarker discovery in clinical diagnostics. Here, we use data from the CAS Content Collection and provide a landscape overview of the current state and delineate trends in research advancement on exosome applications in therapeutics and diagnostics across time, geography, composition, cargo loading, and development pipelines. We discuss exosome composition and pathway, from their biogenesis and secretion from host cells to recipient cell uptake. We assess methods for exosome isolation and purification, their clinical applications in therapy and diagnostics, their development pipelines, the exploration goals of the companies, the assortment of diseases they aim to treat, development stages of their research, and publication trends. We hope this review will be useful for understanding the current knowledge in the field of medical applications of exosomes, in an effort to further solve the remaining challenges in fulfilling their potential.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosome modification to better alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress induced chondrocyte apoptosis and osteoarthritis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by cartilage matrix degeneration and chondrocyte apoptosis. Prolonged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress participates in chondrocyte apoptosis and cartilage degeneration in OA progression. miR-486-5p could suppress the apoptosis of nucleus pulposus cells and cardiomyocyte, yet whether miR-486-5p modified exosomes could modulate ER stress and apoptosis of chondrocytes remain unknown. We validated the increased inflammation and ER stress in OA synovium and cartilage, and the inhibition of ER stress could attenuate the IL-1β induced chondrocyte apoptosis. Administration of exogenous miR-486-5p could inhibit the ER stress, alleviate chondrocytes apoptosis and promote matrix regeneration. In comparison with direct administration of miR-486-5p and miR-486-5p overexpressing ADSCs, miR-486-5p modified exosomes indicated a better effect in modulating chondrocyte homeostasis. MiR-486-5p containing exosomes could also regulate macrophage polarization. Our IVIS imaging data validated that intraarticular injection of miR-486-5p containing exosomes could sustain for at least 7 days. MiR-486-5p containing exosomes showed a better effect on alleviating rats OA compared with direct administration of miR-486-5p and miR-486-5p overexpressing ADSCs. Our data demonstrated that miR-486-5p modified exosomes have a better effect on alleviating chondrocyte apoptosis and osteoarthritis. This study provides evidence of this efficient strategy of exosomal miRNA delivery and the miRNA-based therapy for OA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosome biogenesis: machinery, regulation, and therapeutic implications in cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36320056/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes are well-known key mediators of intercellular communication and contribute to various physiological and pathological processes. Their biogenesis involves four key steps, including cargo sorting, MVB formation and maturation, transport of MVBs, and MVB fusion with the plasma membrane. Each process is modulated through the competition or coordination of multiple mechanisms, whereby diverse repertoires of molecular cargos are sorted into distinct subpopulations of exosomes, resulting in the high heterogeneity of exosomes. Intriguingly, cancer cells exploit various strategies, such as aberrant gene expression, posttranslational modifications, and altered signaling pathways, to regulate the biogenesis, composition, and eventually functions of exosomes to promote cancer progression. Therefore, exosome biogenesis-targeted therapy is being actively explored. In this review, we systematically summarize recent progress in understanding the machinery of exosome biogenesis and how it is regulated in the context of cancer. In particular, we highlight pharmacological targeting of exosome biogenesis as a promising cancer therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A composite hydrogel containing resveratrol-laden nanoparticles and platelet-derived extracellular vesicles promotes wound healing in diabetic mice</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36309190/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36309190/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic wounds are difficult to heal because of persistent inflammation and limited angiogenesis. Resveratrol (RES) is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent. Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEVs) are rich in growth factors and cytokines, which promote proliferation and angiogenesis. However, single drug treatment has limited efficacy and delivery efficiency. Bioengineering can improve the limited effect of single drugs by combining drugs and materials to obtain complementary or cooperative bioengineered drugs. In this study, gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and silk fibroin glycidyl methacrylate (SFMA) were used to synthesize GelMA/SFMA composite hydrogels with suitable mechanical properties, swelling ratio and biodegradability. The composite hydrogel was used as a wound dressing for sustained drug release. RES was loaded into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) to synthesize MSN-RES to enhance the release dynamic, and MSN-RES and PDEVs were combined with the composite hydrogels to form GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels. The GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs had low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility, inhibited macrophage iNOS expression, and promoted the tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. In a diabetic mouse wound model, the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α and iNOS, increased the expression of anti-inflammatory factors TGF-β1 and Arg-1, promoted angiogenesis, and accelerated wound healing. Interestingly, the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels promoted the expression of extracellular purinergic signaling pathway-related CD73 and adenosine 2A receptor (A2A-R). Therefore, the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels could be used as wound dressings to regulate the inflammation and angiogenesis of diabetic wounds and accelerate wound healing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Drugs often fail to function because of a continuous oxidative stress microenvironment and inflammation. Here, a GelMA/SFMA hydrogel, with enhanced mechanical properties and liquid absorption ability, is proposed for sustained release of drugs. In addition to carrying platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEVs) with pro-angiogenic effects, the hydrogels were also loaded with nanoparticle-encapsulated resveratrol with anti-inflammatory activities, aiming to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the wound microenvironment, such that the wound could receive proliferative repair signals to achieve sequential treatment and heal quickly. We also experimentally predicted that the regulatory mechanism of the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs in wound healing might be related to the extracellular purinergic signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Novel Protein Encoded by Exosomal CircATG4B Induces Oxaliplatin Resistance in Colorectal Cancer by Promoting Autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36285810/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxaliplatin is commonly used in chemotherapeutic regimens for colorectal cancer (CRC) after surgical resection. However, acquired chemoresistance seriously affects the curative effect in CRC patients, and the mechanism is still unclear. Here, a circular RNA, circATG4B is identified, which plays an important role in oxaliplatin resistance in CRC. circATG4B expression is found to be increased in exosomes secreted by oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells. In addition, the results suggest that circATG4B induces oxaliplatin resistance by promoting autophagy. Further in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the effect of circATG4B is attributed to its potential to encode a novel protein, circATG4B-222aa. Next, circATG4B-222aa is found to function as a decoy to competitively interact with TMED10 and prevent TMED10 from binding to ATG4B, which leads to increased autophagy followed by induction of chemoresistance. Therefore, this study reveals that exosomal circATG4B participates in the decreased chemosensitivity of CRC cells, providing a new rationale for a potential therapeutic target for oxaliplatin resistance in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EV-ADD, a database for EV-associated DNA in human liquid biopsy samples</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36271888/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a key role in cellular communication both in physiological conditions and in pathologies such as cancer. Emerging evidence has shown that EVs are active carriers of molecular cargo (e.g. protein and nucleic acids) and a powerful source of biomarkers and targets. While recent studies on EV-associated DNA (EV-DNA) in human biofluids have generated a large amount of data, there is currently no database that catalogues information on EV-DNA. To fill this gap, we have manually curated a database of EV-DNA data derived from human biofluids (liquid biopsy) and in-vitro studies, called the &lt;a href=&#34;%28www.evdnadatabase.com%29&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extracellular Vesicle-Associated DNA Database (EV-ADD)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This database contains validated experimental details and data extracted from peer-reviewed published literature. It can be easily queried to search for EV isolation methods and characterization, EV-DNA isolation techniques, quality validation, DNA fragment size, volume of starting material, gene names and disease context. Currently, our database contains samples representing 23 diseases, with 13 different types of EV isolation techniques applied on eight different human biofluids (e.g. blood, saliva). In addition, &lt;a href=&#34;www.evdnadatabase.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EV-ADD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; encompasses EV-DNA data both representing the whole genome and specifically including oncogenes, such as KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, MYC, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). An &lt;a href=&#34;www.evdnadatabase.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EV-ADD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; data metric system was also integrated to assign a compliancy score to the MISEV guidelines based on experimental parameters reported in each study. While currently available databases document the presence of proteins, lipids, RNA and metabolites in EVs (e.g. Vesiclepedia, ExoCarta, ExoBCD, EVpedia, and EV-TRACK), to the best of our knowledge, &lt;a href=&#34;www.evdnadatabase.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EV-ADD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the first of its kind to compile all available EV-DNA datasets derived from human biofluid samples. We believe that this database provides an important reference resource on EV-DNA-based liquid biopsy research, serving as a learning tool and to showcase the latest developments in the EV-DNA field. &lt;a href=&#34;www.evdnadatabase.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EV-ADD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be updated yearly as newly published EV-DNA data becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSC-exos therapy show encouraging potential in diabetic wound treatment, but is hampered by insufficient delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A novel spatio-temporal-varying adhesive microneedle patch that combines the advantages of MSC-exos and antibacterial AgNPs for improving wound healing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficiency tissue repair and bacteria killing were achieved by the proposed MN patch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic wounds affect healthcare systems and increase the risk of infection. Despite the clinical demand for improving healing, an effective and safe therapeutic approach is still lacking. Here, we present a novel spatio-temporal-varying adhesive microneedle (MN) patch encapsulated with mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-exos) and antibacterial Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) for improving wound healing. This MN patch is fabricated by replicating a predesigned flexible template. Consisting of porous methacrylate gelatin hydrogels, the MN tips can continuously deliver anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic MSC-exos to wound beds, which can accelerate healing by improving cell functions, remodeling blood vessels and restoring immune systems. Besides, the silk-fibroin-composed MN back enables the patch to stick to the skin well and fix at the wounded site, thus avoiding secondary bandage. By incorporating AgNPs in the MN back, the MN patch is endowed with the ability to efficiently resist microbial contamination and further benefits wound repair. Such a composite MN patch performs well in relieving inflammation, promoting angiogenesis, and suppressing wound-infecting bacteria during wound injury in diabetic rats, with no adverse effects observed. All the features make this multifunctional MN patch potentially valuable for clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Study of immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes in a mouse model of LPS induced systemic inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36150466/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Sepsis is a debilitating systemic inflammation that resulted from infection or injury. Despite many advances in treatment, the resulting mortality rate has remained high due to increasing antibiotic resistance and aging communities. The present study investigated the effects of stem cell-derived exosomes in a mouse model of LPS-induced systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/em&gt; To induce sepsis, the LPS model was used. Mice were divided into three groups: normal, patient group (LPS + PBS), and treatment group (LPS + exosome). The treatment group received an intravenous exosome 1 h after induction of the model. Patient and treatment groups were sacrificed at 4, 6, 24, and 48 h after induction of the model, and their tissues were isolated. Blood samples were taken from animal hearts to perform biochemical and immunological tests. The study results were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism software version 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes decreased serum levels of ALT and AST liver enzymes, decreased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and improved kidney, liver, and lung tissue damage at 4, 6, and 24 h after model induction. At 24 h, the exosomes were able to reduce serum urea levels. This study revealed decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α after exosome injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our findings suggest that treating mice with stem cell-derived exosomes can ameliorate the destructive effects of inflammation caused by sepsis by reducing inflammatory factors and tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosome-mediated delivery of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes for tissue-specific gene therapy of liver diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36103526/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has emerged as a powerful therapeutic technology, but the lack of safe and efficient &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; delivery systems, especially for tissue-specific vectors, limits its broad clinical applications. Delivery of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) owns competitive advantages over other options; however, the large size of RNPs exceeds the loading capacity of currently available delivery vectors. Here, we report a previously unidentified genome editing delivery system, named exosome&lt;sup&gt;RNP&lt;/sup&gt;, in which Cas9 RNPs were loaded into purified exosomes isolated from hepatic stellate cells through electroporation. Exosome&lt;sup&gt;RNP&lt;/sup&gt; facilitated effective cytosolic delivery of RNP &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; while specifically accumulated in the liver tissue &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Exosome&lt;sup&gt;RNP&lt;/sup&gt; showed vigorous therapeutic potential in acute liver injury, chronic liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma mouse models via targeting p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (&lt;em&gt;PUMA&lt;/em&gt;), cyclin E1 (&lt;em&gt;CcnE1&lt;/em&gt;), and K (lysine) acetyltransferase 5 (&lt;em&gt;KAT5&lt;/em&gt;), respectively. The developed exosome&lt;sup&gt;RNP&lt;/sup&gt; provides a feasible platform for precise and tissue-specific gene therapies of liver diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypoxia-induced exosomal circPDK1 promotes pancreatic cancer glycolysis via c-myc activation by modulating miR-628-3p/BPTF axis and degrading BIN1</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36068586/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; circRNA has been established to play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis development in a variety of cancers; nevertheless, the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of hypoxia-induced exosomal circRNAs in pancreatic cancer remain largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Differentially expressed circRNAs in exosomes between hypoxic exosomes and normoxic exosomes in PC cells were verified by RNA sequencing. The expression of circPDK1 in PC tumors and PC patients was evaluated by qRT-PCR and ISH, and the biological functions of circPDK1 in PC were verified through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Using Western blotting, Co-IP, RNA pull-down, ChIP, RIP, dual-luciferase assays, and rescue experiments, the underlying mechanism of circPDK1 was verified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CircPDK1 was highly abundant in PC tumor tissues and serum exosomes and was associated with poor survival. Exosomal circPDK1 significantly promoted PC cell proliferation, migration, and glycolysis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circPDK1 could be activated by HIF1A at the transcriptional level and sponges miR-628-3p to activate the BPTF/c-myc axis. In addition, circPDK1 serves as a scaffold that enhances the interaction between UBE2O and BIN1, inducing the UBE2O-mediated degradation of BIN1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; We found that circPDK1 was activated by HIF1A at the transcriptional level by modulating the miR-628-3p/BPTF axis and degrading BIN1. Exosomal circPDK1 is a promising biomarker for PC diagnosis and prognosis and represents a potential therapeutic target for PC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://example.com/article/36064768/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to the key causative elements of neurological deficits. However, no effective therapeutics have been developed yet. In our previous work, extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) offered new insights as potential strategies for functional recovery of TBI. The current study aims to elucidate the mechanism of action, providing novel therapeutic targets for future clinical interventions. With the miRNA array performed and Real-time PCR validated, we revealed the crucial function of miR-330-5p transferred by SHED-derived EVs (SHED-EVs) in regulating microglia, the critical immune modulator in central nervous system. MiR-330-5p targeted Ehmt2 and mediated the transcription of CXCL14 to promote M2 microglia polarization and inhibit M1 polarization. Identified in our in vivo data, SHED-EVs and their effector miR-330-5p alleviated the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and resumed the motor functional recovery of TBI rats. In summary, by transferring miR-330-5p, SHED-EVs favored anti-inflammatory microglia polarization through Ehmt2 mediated CXCL14 transcription in treating traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosome from BMMSC Attenuates Cardiopulmonary Bypass-Induced Acute Lung Injury Via YAP/β-Catenin Pathway: Downregulation of Pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36063391/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) accompanied with systemic inflammatory response is an important complication after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Pyroptosis, which is induced by the secretion of inflammatory factors, has been implicated in ALI. However, recent studies have suggested that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMMSC-Exo) can ameliorate ALI, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Therefore, we aim to examine the effects of BMMSC-Exo in CPB-induced ALI, and its underlying mechanism. CPB rat models (male Sprague-Dawley rats) were administered BMMSC-Exo intravenously before induction of ALI. Lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and alveolar macrophage (AM) were collected after the treatments for further analysis, and rat AM NR8383 cells were used for in vitro study. HE staining was performed to detect macrophage infiltration. Western blot was used to detect related proteins expression. And ELISA assay was performed to investigate secretion of inflammatory factors. These results showed that BMMSC-Exo treatment ameliorated macrophage infiltration and oxidative stress, and downregulated expression of pyroptosis-related proteins, including NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, and GSDMD-N, in the lung tissue and AM, as well as decreased the secretion of IL-18 and IL-1β in BALF. Moreover, BMMSC-Exo activated YAP/β-catenin signaling pathway. Overall, these findings of this study indicated that BMMSC-Exo suppressed CPB-induced pyroptosis in ALI by activating YAP/β-catenin axis, which could be a novel strategy for lung protection during CPB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A shared, stochastic pathway mediates exosome protein budding along plasma and endosome membranes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35988652/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles of ∼30 to 150 nm that are secreted by all cells, abundant in all biofluids, and play important roles in health and disease. However, details about the mechanism of exosome biogenesis are unclear. Here, we carried out a cargo-based analysis of exosome cargo protein biogenesis in which we identified the most highly enriched exosomal cargo proteins and then followed their biogenesis, trafficking, and exosomal secretion to test different hypotheses for how cells make exosomes. We show that exosome cargo proteins bud from cells (i) in exosome-sized vesicles regardless of whether they are localized to plasma or endosome membranes, (ii) ∼5-fold more efficiently when localized to the plasma membrane, (iii) ∼5-fold less efficiently when targeted to the endosome membrane, (iv) by a stochastic process that leads to ∼100-fold differences in their abundance from one exosome to another, and (v) independently of small GTPase Rab27a, the ESCRT complex-associated protein Alix, or the cargo protein CD63. Taken together, our results demonstrate that cells use a shared, stochastic mechanism to bud exosome cargoes along the spectrum of plasma and endosome membranes and far more efficiently from the plasma membrane than the endosome. Our observations also indicate that the pronounced variation in content between different exosome-sized vesicles is an inevitable consequence of a stochastic mechanism of small vesicle biogenesis, that the origin membrane of exosome-sized extracellular vesicles simply cannot be determined, and that most of what we currently know about exosomes has likely come from studies of plasma membrane-derived vesicles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adipocyte-Derived Exosomal MTTP Suppresses Ferroptosis and Promotes Chemoresistance in Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35978266/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity is closely related to a poor prognosis in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), but the mechanisms remain unclear. Ferroptosis is a form of nonapoptotic cell death characterized by lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and iron dependency and is associated with the chemoresistance of tumors. Here, it is shown that adipose-derived exosomes reduce ferroptosis susceptibility in CRC, thus promoting chemoresistance to oxaliplatin. It is found that microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) expression is increased in the plasma exosomes of CRC patients with a high body fat ratio, serving as an inhibitor of ferroptosis and reducing sensitivity to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, the MTTP/proline-rich acidic protein 1 (PRAP1) complex inhibited zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 expression and upregulated glutathione peroxidase 4 and xCT, leading to a decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio and lipid ROS levels. Moreover, experiments are carried out in organoids, and a tumor implantation model is established in obese mice, demonstrating that the inhibition of MTTP increases the sensitivity to chemotherapy. The results reveal a novel intracellular signaling pathway mediated by adipose-derived exosomes and suggest that treatments targeting secreted MTTP might reverse oxaliplatin resistance in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adipose mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomal microRNAs ameliorate polycystic ovary syndrome by protecting against metabolic disturbances</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine and metabolic disorder in women of childbearing age. Adipose mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) secrete cytokines involved in the regulation of metabolism and immunity. However, it remains unclear whether exosomes secreted by AMSCs (AMSC-EXOs) can rescue the polycystic phenotype and metabolic dysfunction in PCOS ovaries. Here, we show that AMSC-EXOs can protect against metabolic disturbances, ameliorate ovarian polycystic, and improve fertility in a rat model of PCOS. AMSC-EXOs inhibited the expression of B-cell translocation gene 2 by transferring miR-21-5p to the livers of rats with PCOS, thus activating the IRS1/AKT pathway and increasing hepatic metabolism. The role of AMSC-EXOs in transferring miRNAs to the liver to improve metabolic dysfunction in PCOS and reproduction by rescuing a non-coding RNA pathway was also discovered. This study provides a theoretical basis for the use of rat adipose stem cells and their secreted exosomes to treat PCOS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality. Currently, the primary treatment for ALI/ARDS is mainly symptomatic therapy such as mechanical ventilation and fluid management. Due to the lack of effective treatment strategies, most ALI/ARDS patients face a poor prognosis. The discovery of exosomes has created a promising prospect for the treatment of ALI/ARDS. Exosomes can exert anti-inflammatory effects, inhibit apoptosis, and promote cell regeneration. The microRNA contained in exosomes can participate in intercellular communication and play an immunomodulatory role in ALI/ARDS disease models. This review discusses the possible mechanisms of exosomes in ALI/ARDS to facilitate the development of innovative treatments for ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles as an emerging drug delivery system for cancer treatment: Current strategies and recent advances</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36076581/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer is one of the primary causes of death worldwide, and its morbidity and mortality rates are increasing rapidly. However, standard treatment modalities (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy) often fail to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic effect. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural nano-sized lipid bilayer vesicles secreted from cells. Owing to their advantages of low toxicity, high biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and inherent targeting, EVs can be exploited as drug delivery vectors for cancer treatment. In this review, we summarize the research progress of EV-based drug delivery systems in cancer treatment by focusing on four aspects: sources, cargo types, cargo loading methods and modification strategies. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomal lncRNA TUG1 derived from human urine-derived stem cells attenuates renal ischemia/reperfusion injury by interacting with SRSF1 to regulate ASCL4-mediated ferroptosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LncRNA TUG1 carried by USC-Exo regulates cell ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LncRNA TUG1 regulates the stability of ACSL4 mRNA by interacting with SRSF1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LncRNA TUG1 alleviates IRI-induced AKI by suppressing ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Human urine-derived stem cells (USCs)-derived exosomes (USC-Exo) could improve kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), while the underlying mechanisms of this protective effect remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Human USCs and USC-Exo were isolated and verified by morphology and specific biomarkers. The effects of USC-Exo on ferroptosis and kidney injury were detected in the IRI-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) model in C57BL/6 mice. The effects of USC-Exo on ferroptosis and lncRNA taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) were detected in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-treated human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2). The interaction of SRSF1 and TUG1, ACSL4 was checked via RNA pull-down/RIP and RNA stability assays. The effects of LncRNA TUG1 on SRSF1/ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis were verified in H/R-treated HK-2 cells and the IRI-induced AKI mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; USC-Exo treatment improved kidney injury and ameliorated ferroptosis in IRI-induced AKI mouse models. USC-Exo were rich in lncRNA TUG1, which suppressed ferroptosis in HK-2 cells exposed to H/R. Mechanistically, lncRNA TUG1 regulates the stability of ACSL4 mRNA by interacting with RNA-binding protein SRSF1. In addition, SRSF1 upregulation or ACSL4 downregulation partially reversed the protective effect of lncRNA TUG1 on ferroptosis in H/R-treated HK-2 cells. Further, ACSL4 upregulation partially reversed TUG1&amp;rsquo;s repression on kidney injury and ferroptosis in IRI-induced AKI mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Collectively, lncRNA TUG1 carried by USC-Exo regulated ASCL4-mediated ferroptosis by interacting with SRSF1 and then protected IRI-induced AKI. Potentially, USC-Exo rich in lncRNA TUG1 can serve as a promising therapeutic method for IRI-AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging role of exosomes in cancer progression and tumor microenvironment remodeling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35765040/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and the factors responsible for its progression need to be elucidated. Exosomes are structures with an average size of 100 nm that can transport proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. This review focuses on the role of exosomes in cancer progression and therapy. We discuss how exosomes are able to modulate components of the tumor microenvironment and influence proliferation and migration rates of cancer cells. We also highlight that, depending on their cargo, exosomes can suppress or promote tumor cell progression and can enhance or reduce cancer cell response to radio- and chemo-therapies. In addition, we describe how exosomes can trigger chronic inflammation and lead to immune evasion and tumor progression by focusing on their ability to transfer non-coding RNAs between cells and modulate other molecular signaling pathways such as PTEN and PI3K/Akt in cancer. Subsequently, we discuss the use of exosomes as carriers of anti-tumor agents and genetic tools to control cancer progression. We then discuss the role of tumor-derived exosomes in carcinogenesis. Finally, we devote a section to the study of exosomes as diagnostic and prognostic tools in clinical courses that is important for the treatment of cancer patients. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of exosomes in cancer therapy, focusing on their therapeutic value in cancer progression and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structure and regulation of the nuclear exosome targeting complex guides RNA substrates to the exosome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35688157/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NEXT homodimerizes through two intertwined ZCCHC8 subunits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZCCHC8 binds MTR4 with both constitutive and regulatory interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stable MTR4 arch interactions orient the two helicases in opposite directions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulatory interactions at the MTR4 helicase domain guide RNA to the exosome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mammalian cells, spurious transcription results in a vast repertoire of unproductive non-coding RNAs, whose deleterious accumulation is prevented by rapid decay. The nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex plays a central role in directing non-functional transcripts to exosome-mediated degradation, but the structural and molecular mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we elucidated the architecture of the human NEXT complex, showing that it exists as a dimer of MTR4-ZCCHC8-RBM7 heterotrimers. Dimerization preconfigures the major MTR4-binding region of ZCCHC8 and arranges the two MTR4 helicases opposite to each other, with each protomer able to function on many types of RNAs. In the inactive state of the complex, the 3&amp;rsquo; end of an RNA substrate is enclosed in the MTR4 helicase channel by a ZCCHC8 C-terminal gatekeeping domain. The architecture of a NEXT-exosome assembly points to the molecular and regulatory mechanisms with which the NEXT complex guides RNA substrates to the exosome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomes deliver lncRNA DARS-AS1 siRNA to inhibit chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced TNBC metastasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35688263/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exosomes are natural nanocarriers for efficient delivery of siRNA to recipient cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SiRNA-loaded exosomes were performed by modified calcium-mediated transfection method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SiRNA-loaded exosomes demonstrated dose-dependent knockdown efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SiRNA-loaded exosomes showed strong antitumor activity on TNBC cells in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SiRNA-loaded exosomes intensively inhibited TNBC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a rapidly recurring and highly metastatic malignancy with high heterogeneity and chemoradiotherapy resistance. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) can induce the occurrence of tumors and enhance lymphatic infiltration and distant metastasis through direct interaction with the sympathetic nervous system; however, its relevance in TNBC is yet to be clarified. In this study, DARS-AS1, a newly reported CUMS-responsive lncRNA, was found to be enriched in TNBC clinical tumors and cells and positively correlated with late clinical stage in patients with TNBC. DARS-AS1 overexpression significantly enhanced the migration and invasion of TNBC tumors by inhibiting miR-129-2-3p and upregulated CDK1 to activate the NF-κB/STAT3 signaling pathway both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Treatment with DARS-AS1 siRNA-loaded exosomes (EXOs) substantially slowed CUMS-induced TNBC cell growth and liver metastasis. Therefore, DARS-AS1 represents a potential therapeutic target for metastatic TNBC, and EXOs may serve as siRNA delivery carriers in clinical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activated Drp1 regulates p62-mediated autophagic flux and aggravates inflammation in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion via the ROS-RIP1/RIP3-exosome axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35624495/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) refers to a secondary brain injury that can occur when the blood supply to the ischemic brain tissue is restored. However, the mechanism underlying such injury remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; The 150 male C57 mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h and reperfusion for 24 h, Among them, 50 MCAO mice were further treated with Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1) and 50 MCAO mice were further treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in a low-glucose culture medium for 4 h under hypoxic conditions and then transferred to normal conditions for 12 h. Then, cerebral blood flow, mitochondrial structure, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagic flux, aggresome and exosome expression profiles, cardiac tissue structure, mitochondrial length and cristae density, mtDNA and ROS content, as well as the expression of Drp1-Ser616/Drp1, RIP1/RIP3, LC3 II/LC3 I, TNF-α, IL-1β, etc., were detected under normal or Drp1 interference conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; The mtDNA content, ROS levels, and Drp1-Ser616/Drp1 were elevated by 2.2, 1.7 and 2.7 times after CIRI (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). However, the high cytoplasmic LC3 II/I ratio and increased aggregation of p62 could be reversed by 44% and 88% by Drp1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The low fluorescence intensity of autophagic flux and the increased phosphorylation of RIP3 induced by CIRI could be attenuated by ROS scavenger, NAC (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). RIP1/RIP3 inhibitor Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) restored 75% to a low LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and enhanced 2 times to a high RFP-LC3 after Drp1 activation (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, although CIRI-induced ROS production caused no considerable accumulation of autophagosomes (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05), it increased the packaging and extracellular secretion of exosomes containing p62 by 4 - 5 times, which could be decreased by Mdivi-1, Drp1 shRNA, and Nec-1 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, TNF-α and IL-1β increased in CIRI-derived exosomes could increase RIP3 phosphorylation in normal or oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) conditions (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; CIRI activated Drp1 and accelerated the p62-mediated formation of autophagosomes while inhibiting the transition of autophagosomes to autolysosomes via the RIP1/RIP3 pathway activation. Undegraded autophagosomes were secreted extracellularly in the form of exosomes, leading to inflammatory cascades that further damaged mitochondria, resulting in excessive ROS generation and the blockage of autophagosome degradation, triggering a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plasma-Enabled Smart Nanoexosome Platform as Emerging Immunopathogenesis for Clinical Viral Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35631640/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart nanoexosomes are nanosized structures enclosed in lipid bilayers that are structurally similar to the viruses released by a variety of cells, including the cells lining the respiratory system. Of particular importance, the interaction between smart nanoexosomes and viruses can be used to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines. It is possible that nanoexosomes will be utilized and antibodies will be acquired more successfully for the transmission of an immune response if reconvalescent plasma (CP) is used instead of reconvalescent plasma exosomes (CPExo) in this concept. Convalescent plasma contains billions of smart nanoexosomes capable of transporting a variety of molecules, including proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA among other viral infections. Smart nanoexosomes are released from virus-infected cells and play an important role in mediating communication between infected and uninfected cells. Infections use the formation, production and release of smart nanoexosomes to enhance the infection, transmission and intercellular diffusion of viruses. Cell-free smart nanoexosomes produced by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could also be used as cell-free therapies in certain cases. Smart nanoexosomes produced by mesenchymal stem cells can also promote mitochondrial function and heal lung injury. They can reduce cytokine storms and restore the suppression of host antiviral defenses weakened by viral infections. This study examines the benefits of smart nanoexosomes and their roles in viral transmission, infection, treatment, drug delivery and clinical applications. We also explore some potential future applications for smart nanoexosomes in the treatment of viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication. They have important roles in numerous physiological and pathological processes, and show considerable promise as novel biomarkers of disease, as therapeutic agents and as drug delivery vehicles. Intriguingly, however, understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the many observed functions of EVs remains far from comprehensive, at least partly due to technical challenges in working with these small messengers. Here, we highlight areas of consensus as well as contentious issues in our understanding of the intracellular and intercellular journey of EVs: from biogenesis, release and dynamics in the extracellular space, to interaction with and uptake by recipient cells. We define knowledge gaps, identify key questions and challenges, and make recommendations on how to address these.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Universal immunotherapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma with exosome vaccines that engage adaptive and innate immune responses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Personalized immunotherapy utilizing cancer vaccines tailored to the tumors of individual patients holds promise for tumors with high genetic heterogeneity, potentially enabling eradication of the tumor in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Here, we demonstrate a general strategy for biological nanovaccines that trigger tailored tumor-specific immune responses for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Dendritic cell (DC)-derived exosomes (DEX) are painted with a HCC-targeting peptide (P47-P), an α-fetoprotein epitope (AFP212-A2) and a functional domain of high mobility group nucleosome-binding protein 1 (N1ND-N), an immunoadjuvant for DC recruitment and activation, via an exosomal anchor peptide to form a &amp;ldquo;trigger&amp;rdquo; DEX vaccine (DEX&lt;sub&gt;P&amp;amp;A2&amp;amp;N&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; DEX&lt;sub&gt;P&amp;amp;A2&amp;amp;N&lt;/sub&gt; specifically promoted recruitment, accumulation and activation of DCs in mice with orthotopic HCC tumor, resulting in enhanced cross-presentation of tumor neoantigens and de novo T cell response. DEX&lt;sub&gt;P&amp;amp;A2&amp;amp;N&lt;/sub&gt; elicited significant tumor retardation and tumor-specific immune responses in HCC mice with large tumor burdens. Importantly, tumor eradication was achieved in orthotopic HCC mice when antigenic AFP peptide was replaced with the full-length AFP (A) to form DEX&lt;sub&gt;P&amp;amp;A&amp;amp;N&lt;/sub&gt;. Supplementation of Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand greatly augmented the antitumor immunity of DEX&lt;sub&gt;P&amp;amp;A&amp;amp;N&lt;/sub&gt; by increasing immunological memory against tumor re-challenge in orthotopic HCC mice. Depletion of T cells, cross-presenting DCs and other innate immune cells abrogated the functionality of DEX&lt;sub&gt;P&amp;amp;A&amp;amp;N&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings demonstrate the capacity of universal DEX vaccines to induce tumor-specific immune responses by triggering an immune response tailored to the tumors of each individual, thus presenting a generalizable approach for personalized immunotherapy of HCC, by extension of other tumors, without the need to identify tumor antigens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a beneficial and physiological process, but there are a number of inflammatory diseases which have detrimental effects on the body. In addition, the drugs used to treat inflammation have toxic side effects when used over a long period of time. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells that can be isolated from a variety of tissues and can be differentiate into diverse cell types under appropriate conditions. They also exhibit noteworthy anti-inflammatory properties, providing new options for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The therapeutic potential of MSCs is currently being investigated for various inflammatory diseases, such as kidney injury, lung injury, osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). MSCs can perform multiple functions, including immunomodulation, homing, and differentiation, to enable damaged tissues to form a balanced inflammatory and regenerative microenvironment under severe inflammatory conditions. In addition, accumulated evidence indicates that exosomes from extracellular vesicles of MSCs (MSC-Exos) play an extraordinary role, mainly by transferring their components to recipient cells. In this review, we summarize the mechanism and clinical trials of MSCs and MSC-Exos in various inflammatory diseases in detail, with a view to contributing to the treatment of MSCs and MSC-Exos in inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of exosomal non-coding RNAs from tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35405312/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes have a crucial role in intercellular communication and mediate interactions between tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Exosome-encapsulated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are involved in various physiological processes. Tumor-derived exosomal ncRNAs induce M2 macrophage polarization through signaling pathway activation, signal transduction, and transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Conversely, TAM-derived exosomal ncRNAs promote tumor proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, chemoresistance, and immunosuppression. MicroRNAs induce gene silencing by directly targeting mRNAs, whereas lncRNAs and circRNAs act as miRNA sponges to indirectly regulate protein expressions. The role of ncRNAs in tumor-host interactions is ubiquitous. Current research is increasingly focused on the tumor microenvironment. On the basis of the &amp;ldquo;cancer-immunity cycle&amp;rdquo; hypothesis, we discuss the effects of exosomal ncRNAs on immune cells to induce T cell exhaustion, overexpression of programmed cell death ligands, and create a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. Furthermore, we discuss potential applications and prospects of exosomal ncRNAs as clinical biomarkers and drug delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TNF-α stimulation enhances the neuroprotective effects of gingival MSCs derived exosomes in retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury via the MEG3/miR-21a-5p axis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35378413/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the main pathogenic mechanisms of glaucoma, which are largely unknown, including neuroinflammation and neuronal death in the pathological process. In our previous studies, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to play anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective roles. Additionally, conditioned culture medium (CM) of MSCs stimulated by TNF-α have achieved better antiallergic effects in an experimental allergic conjunctivitis mouse model. However, there is an urgent need for cell-free therapy approaches, like exosomes, to reduce the side effects of autoimmunity. The present study aimed to elucidate the pathways involving TNF-α-stimulated gingival MSC (GMSC)-exosomes (TG-exos), in modulating inflammatory microglia and alleviating apoptosis. In this study, exosomes from the CM of GMSCs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and were injected into the vitreous of mice. The results showed that intraocular injection of TG-exos into mice with IRI notably reduced inflammation and cell loss than that with G-exos (GMSC-exosomes). Similar results were observed in vitro. Additionally, with the microRNA (miR) arrays, it was found that miR-21-5p acted as a crucial factor in TG-exos for neuroprotection and anti-inflammation. Following target prediction and dual-luciferase assay suggested that miR-21-5p played a role by combining with programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), which was regulated by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). This study demonstrates a new therapeutic pathway for neuroprotection against IRI by delivering miR-21-5p-enriched exosomes through MEG3/miR-21-5p/PDCD4 axis and paves the way for the establishment of a cell-free therapeutic approach for glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AdMSC-derived exosomes alleviate acute lung injury via transferring mitochondrial component to improve homeostasis of alveolar macrophages</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35401830/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Aberrant activation of macrophages with mitochondria dismiss was proved to be associated with pathogenesis of ALI (acute lung injury). Exosomes from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC-Exos) have been distinguished by their low immunogenicity, lack of tumorigenicity, and high clinical safety, but their role in treating ALI and the mechanism involved need to be defined. In this study, we sought to investigate whether the mitochondrial donation from AdMSC-Exos provides profound protection against LPS-induced ALI in mice, accompanied by improvement of macrophage mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; C57BL/6 mice were orotracheally instilled with LPS (1 mg/kg). AdMSC-Exos were administered via the tail vein 4 h after LPS inhalation. Flow cytometry, H&amp;amp;E, Quantitative Real-Time PCR, immunofluorescence (IF), confocal microscopy imaging was conducted to investigate lung tissue inflammation and macrophage mitochondrial function. And further observe the transfer of exosomes and the effect on mitochondrial function of MH-S cells through &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; AdMSC-Exos can transfer the stem cell-derived mitochondria components to alveolar macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Likely through complementing the damaged mitochondria, AdMSC-Exos exhibited the ability to elevate the level of mtDNA, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), OXPHOS activity and ATP generation, while reliving mROS stress in LPS-challenged macrophages. Restoring mitochondrial integrity via AdMSC-Exos treatment enabled macrophages shifting to anti-inflammatory phenotype, as featured with the down-regulation of IL-1β, TNF-α and iNOS secretion and increase in production of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and Arg-1. As we depleted alveolar macrophages using clodronate liposomes, the protective role for AdMSC-Exos was largely abrogated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; AdMSC-Exos can effectively donate mitochondria component improved macrophages mitochondrial integrity and oxidative phosphorylation level, leading to the resumption of metabolic and immune homeostasis of airway macrophages and mitigating lung inflammatory pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distinguishing functional exosomes and other extracellular vesicles as a nucleic acid cargo by the anion-exchange method</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35289089/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of a new large-scale purification protocol is required for research on the reliable bioactivity and drug discovery of extracellular vesicles (EVs). To address this issue, herein, we propose an effective method for preparing high-performance exosomes (EXOs) by using an anion-exchange method. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) EVs from 4 L of culture supernatant through a 220 nm cut-off filter are divided into two populations at a deproteinization rate of over 99.97%, which are eluted at low (0.15 M-0.3 M) and high (0.3 M-0.5 M) NaCl concentrations (approximately 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; particles, respectively) through the anion-exchange column chromatography. The former are abundant in EXO proteins, including late endosome-associated proteins and rab-family and integrin-family proteins, and functional micro (mi) RNAs, and have bioactivity for preventing tumour metastasis by depleting mesenchymal cell populations in the primary tumour lesions. By contrast, the latter is microvesicle (MV)-like particles including DNA, core histone and ribosomal proteins, and GC-rich miRNAs with unknown function, and are easily phagocytosed by mannose receptor&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Kupffer cells. Thus, the anion-exchange method is suitable for the large-scale separation of bioactive EXOs and MV-like EVs as a cargo for dangerous nucleic acids at high-purity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Engineered exosome as targeted lncRNA MEG3 delivery vehicles for osteosarcoma therapy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes as nanosized membrane vesicles, could targeted deliver therapeutic agents by modification with target ligands. Exosome-derived non-coding RNAs play a vital role in the development of tumors. Previous evidences reveal that long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (lncRNA MEG3) has anti-tumor properties. Whereas, the inhibitory effects of exosome-derived lncRNA MEG3 in osteosarcoma (OS) remain largely unknown. In this study, we utilize the engineering technology to combine exosome and lncRNA for tumor-targeting therapy of OS. We elucidated the anti-OS effects of lncRNA MEG3, and then prepared the c(RGDyK)-modified and MEG3-loaded exosomes (cRGD-Exo-MEG3). The engineered exosomes cRGD-Exo-MEG3 could deliver more efficiently to OS cells both in vitro and in vivo. In this way, cRGD-Exo-MEG3 facilitate the anti-OS effects of MEG3 significantly, with the help of enhanced tumor-targeting therapy. This study elucidates that engineered exosomes as targeted lncRNA MEG3 delivery vehicles have potentially therapeutic effects for OS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BMSC-Derived Exosomes Carrying lncRNA-ZFAS1 Alleviate Pulmonary Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by UPF1-Mediated mRNA Decay of FOXD1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) exert protective effects against pulmonary ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury; however, the potential mechanism involved in their protective ability remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to explore the function and underlying mechanism of BMSC-derived exosomal lncRNA-ZFAS1 in pulmonary I/R injury. Pulmonary I/R injury models were established in mice and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-exposed primary mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMECs). Exosomes were extracted from BMSCs. Target molecule expression was assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Pathological changes in the lungs, pulmonary edema, apoptosis, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, SOD, MPO activities, and MDA level were measured. The proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of LMECs were detected by CCK-8, EdU staining, flow cytometry, and scratch assay. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down, RIP, and ChIP assays were performed to validate the molecular interaction. In the mouse model of pulmonary I/R injury, BMSC-Exos treatment relieved lung pathological injury, reduced lung W/D weight ratio, and restrained apoptosis and inflammation, whereas exosomal ZFAS1 silencing abolished these beneficial effects. In addition, the proliferation, migration inhibition, apoptosis, and inflammation in H/R-exposed LMECs were repressed by BMSC-derived exosomal ZFAS1. Mechanistically, ZFAS1 contributed to FOXD1 mRNA decay via interaction with UPF1, thereby leading to Gal-3 inactivation. Furthermore, FOXD1 depletion strengthened the weakened protective effect of ZFAS1-silenced BMSC-Exos on pulmonary I/R injury. ZFAS1 delivered by BMSC-Exos results in FOXD1 mRNA decay and subsequent Gal-3 inactivation via direct interaction with UPF1, thereby attenuating pulmonary I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomes derived from adipose-derived stem cells alleviate cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammation and injury by inhibiting alveolar macrophages pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35016678/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a frequently encountered disease condition in clinical practice mainly caused by cigarette smoke (CS). The aim of this study was to investigate the protective roles of human adipose-derived stem cells-derived exosomes (ADSCs-Exo) in CS-induced lung inflammation and injury and explore the underlying mechanism by discovering the effects of ADSCs-Exo on alveolar macrophages (AMs) pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; ADSCs were isolated from human adipose tissues harvested from three healthy donors, and then ADSCs-Exo were isolated. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, 24 age-matched male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to CS for 4 weeks, followed by intratracheal administration of ADSCs-Exo or phosphate buffered saline. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, MH-S cells, derived from mouse AMs, were stimulated by 2% CS extract (CSE) for 24 h, followed by the treatment of ADSCs-Exo or phosphate buffered saline. Pulmonary inflammation was analyzed by detecting pro-inflammatory cells and mediators in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Lung histology was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Mucus production was determined by Alcian blue-periodic acid-Schiff staining. The profile of AMs pyroptosis was evaluated by detecting the levels of pyroptosis-indicated proteins. The inflammatory response in AMs and the phagocytic activity of AMs were also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; In mice exposed to CS, the levels of pro-inflammatory cells and mediators were significantly increased, mucus production was markedly increased and lung architecture was obviously disrupted. AMs pyroptosis was elevated and AMs phagocytosis was inhibited. However, the administration of ADSCs-Exo greatly reversed these alterations caused by CS exposure. Consistently, in MH-S cells with CSE-induced properties modelling those found in COPD, the cellular inflammatory response was elevated, the pyroptotic activity was upregulated while the phagocytosis was decreased. Nonetheless, these abnormalities were remarkably alleviated by the treatment of ADSCs-Exo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; ADSCs-Exo effectively attenuate CS-induced airway mucus overproduction, lung inflammation and injury by inhibiting AMs pyroptosis. Therefore, hADSCs-Exo may be a promising cell-free therapeutic candidate for CS-induced lung inflammation and injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) represents a frequent sepsis-induced inflammatory disorder. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) elicit anti-inflammatory effects in sepsis. This study investigated the mechanism of exosomes from adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) in sepsis-induced ALI. The IL-27r&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; (WSX-1 knockout) or wild-type mouse model of sepsis was established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The model mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages were treated with ADMSC-exosomes. The content of Dil-labeled exosomes in pulmonary macrophages, macrophages CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in whole lung tissues, and IL-27 content in macrophages were detected. The mRNA expression and protein level of IL27 subunits P28 and EBI3 in lung tissue and the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β were measured. The pulmonary edema, tissue injury, and pulmonary vascular leakage were measured. In vitro, macrophages internalized ADMSC-exosomes, and ADMSC-exosomes inhibited IL-27 secretion in LPS-induced macrophages. In vivo, IL-27 knockout attenuated CLP-induced ALI. ADMSC-exosomes suppressed macrophage aggregation in lung tissues and inhibited IL-27 secretion. ADMSC-exosomes decreased the contents of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, reduced pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular leakage, and improved the survival rate of mice. Injection of recombinant IL-27 reversed the protective effect of ADMSC-exosomes on sepsis mice. Collectively, ADMSC-exosomes inhibited IL-27 secretion in macrophages and alleviated sepsis-induced ALI in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the global leading cause of cancer-related deaths due to the deficiency of targets for precision therapy. A new modality of epigenetic regulation has emerged involving RNA-RNA crosstalk networks where two or more competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) bind to the same microRNAs. However, the contribution of such mechanisms in HCC has not been well studied. Herein, potential HMGB1-driven RNA-RNA crosstalk networks were evaluated at different HCC stages, identifying the mTORC2 component RICTOR as a potential HMGB1 ceRNA in HBV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; early stage HCC. Indeed, elevated HMGB1 mRNA was found to promote the expression of RICTOR mRNA through competitively binding with the miR-200 family, especially miR-429. Functional assays employing overexpression or interference strategies demonstrated that the HMGB1 and RICTOR 3&amp;rsquo;untranslated regions (UTR) epigenetically promoted the malignant proliferation, self-renewal, and tumorigenesis in HCC cells. Intriguingly, interference against HMGB1 and RICTOR in HCC cells promoted a stronger anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy response, which appeared to associate with the production of PD-L1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exosomes. Mechanistically, the HMGB1-driven RNA-RNA crosstalk network facilitated HCC cell glutamine metabolism via dual mechanisms, activating a positive feedback loop involving mTORC2-AKT-C-MYC to upregulate glutamine synthetase (GS) expression, and inducing mTORC1 signaling to derepress SIRT4 on glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Meanwhile, this crosstalk network could impede the efficacy of immunotherapy through mTORC1-P70S6K dependent PD-L1 production and PD-L1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exosomes activity. In conclusion, our study highlights the non-coding regulatory role of HMGB1 with implications for RNA-based therapeutic targeting together with a prediction of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in HCC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sympathetic Neurostress Drives Osteoblastic Exosomal MiR-21 Transfer to Disrupt Bone Homeostasis and Promote Osteopenia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35312228/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innervation and extracellular vesicle secretion co-exist in the local tissue microenvironment for message transfer, but whether they are interconnected to regulate organ homeostasis remains unknown. Sympatho-adrenergic activation is implicated in stress-induced depression and leads to bone loss, but the mechanisms and therapeutics are incompletely elucidated. Here, it is revealed that sympathetic neurostress through the β1/2 -adrenergic receptor (β1/2-AR) signaling triggers the transcription response of a microRNA, miR-21, in osteoblasts, which is transferred to osteoclast progenitors via exosomes for dictating osteoclastogenesis. After confirming that miR-21 deficiency retards the β1/2-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO)-induced osteopenia, it is shown that the pharmacological inhibition of exosome release by two clinically-relevant drugs, dimethyl amiloride and omeprazole, suppresses osteoblastic miR-21 transfer and ameliorates bone loss under both ISO and chronic variable stress (CVS)-induced depression conditions. A targeted delivery approach to specifically silence osteoblastic miR-21 is further applied, which is effective in rescuing the bone remodeling balance and ameliorating ISO- and CVS-induced osteopenias. These results decipher a previously unrecognized paradigm that neural cues drive exosomal microRNA communication to regulate organ homeostasis and help to establish feasible strategies to counteract bone loss under psychological stresses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Specificities of exosome versus small ectosome secretion revealed by live intracellular tracking of CD63 and CD9</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their roles in intercellular communications, the different populations of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their secretion mechanisms are not fully characterized: how and to what extent EVs form as intraluminal vesicles of endocytic compartments (exosomes), or at the plasma membrane (PM) (ectosomes) remains unclear. Here we follow intracellular trafficking of the EV markers CD9 and CD63 from the endoplasmic reticulum to their residency compartment, respectively PM and late endosomes. We observe transient co-localization at both places, before they finally segregate. CD9 and a mutant CD63 stabilized at the PM are more abundantly released in EVs than CD63. Thus, in HeLa cells, ectosomes are more prominent than exosomes. By comparative proteomic analysis and differential response to neutralization of endosomal pH, we identify a few surface proteins likely specific of either exosomes (LAMP1) or ectosomes (BSG, SLC3A2). Our work sets the path for molecular and functional discrimination of exosomes and small ectosomes in any cell type.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypoxia adipose stem cell-derived exosomes promote high-quality healing of diabetic wound involves activation of PI3K/Akt pathways</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refractory diabetic wounds can cause persistent inflammation and delayed healing due to hypoxia. Currently, no optimal solution is available. Exosomes of adipose stem cells (ADSCs-exo) may promote skin wound healing, however, molecular mechanisms remains mysterious. We found significantly enhanced survival and proliferation of adipose stem cells after hypoxia induction compared to normoxia. Here, we aimed to investigate if hypoxic adipose stem cells exosomes (HypADSCs-exo) participate in hypoxia adaptability and accelerate diabetic wound healing. Based on high-throughput sequencing, 215 microRNAs (miRNAs) were upregulated and 369 miRNAs downregulated in HypADSCs-exo compared to ADSCs-exo. Up-regulated miR-21-3p, miR-126-5p, miR-31-5p whereas down-regulated gene miR-99b and miR-146-a correlated with wound healing. According to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), miRNAs might regulate cell metabolism, differentiation and Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) function. Consistently, HpyADSCs-exo could promote diabetic wounds healing and inhibit inflammation through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Collectively, HpyADSCs-exo can promote diabetic wound healing as an alternative strategy to improve wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-α/β)-mediated immune response is the first line of host defense against invading viruses. IFN-α/β binds to IFN-α/β receptors (IFNARs) and triggers the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Thus, stabilization of IFNARs is important for prolonging antiviral activity. Here, we report the induction of an RNA-binding motif-containing protein, RBM47, upon viral infection or interferon stimulation. Using multiple virus infection models, we demonstrate that RBM47 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. RBM47 has no noticeable impact on IFN production, but significantly activates the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and enhances the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Mechanistically, RBM47 binds to the 3&amp;rsquo;UTR of IFNAR1 mRNA, increases mRNA stability, and retards the degradation of IFNAR1. In summary, this study suggests that RBM47 is an interferon-inducible RNA-binding protein that plays an essential role in enhancing host IFN downstream signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gene-engineered exosomes-thermosensitive liposomes hybrid nanovesicles by the blockade of CD47 signal for combined photothermal therapy and cancer immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34147721/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD47, overexpressed on kinds of tumor cells, activates a &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t eat me&amp;rdquo; signal through binding to signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα), leading to immune escape from the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). It is also a huge challenge to deliver therapeutic drugs to the tumor sites due to the short retention time in blood, poor targeting of tumor cells and accelerated clearance by MPS. Herein, we designed a hybrid therapeutic nanovesicles, named as hGLV, by fusing gene-engineered exosomes with drug-loaded thermosensitive liposomes. We demonstrated that the CD47-overexpressed hGLV exhibited the long blood circulation and improved the macrophages-mediated the phagocytosis of tumor cells by blocking CD47 signal. Moreover, the resulted hGLV could remarkably target the homologous tumor in mice, achieving the preferential accumulation at the tumor sites. Importantly, hGLV loading the photothermal agent could achieve the excellent photothermal therapy (PTT) under laser irradiation after the intravenous injection, completely eliminating the tumors, leading to immunogenic cell death and generating substantial tumor-associated antigens, which could promote the maturation of immature dendritic cells with the help of the co-encapsulated immune adjuvant to trigger strong immune responses. Generally, the hybrid nanovesicles based on CD47 immune check point blockade can be a promising platform for the drug delivery in cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes, a class of small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm), are secreted by almost all types of cells into virtually all body fluids. These small vesicles are attracting increasing research attention owing to their potential for disease diagnosis and therapy. However, their inherent heterogeneity and the complexity of bio-fluids pose significant challenges for their isolation. Even the &amp;ldquo;gold standard,&amp;rdquo; differential centrifugation, suffers from poor yields and is time-consuming. In this context, recent developments in microfluidic technologies have provided an ideal system for exosome extraction and these devices exhibit some fascinating properties such as high speeds, good portability, and low sample volumes. In this review, the focus is on the state-of-the-art microfluidic technologies for exosome isolation and highlight potential directions for future research and development by analyzing the challenges faced by the current strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Delivering Antisense Oligonucleotides across the Blood-Brain Barrier by Tumor Cell-Derived Small Apoptotic Bodies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the most restrictive and complicated barrier that keeps most biomolecules and drugs from the brain. An efficient brain delivery strategy is urgently needed for the treatment of brain diseases. Based on the studies of brain-targeting extracellular vesicles (EVs), the potential of using small apoptotic bodies (sABs) from brain metastatic cancer cells for brain-targeting drug delivery is explored. It is found that anti-TNF-α antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) combined with cationic konjac glucomannan (cKGM) can be successfully loaded into sABs via a transfection/apoptosis induction process and that the sABs generated by B16F10 cells have an extraordinarily high brain delivery efficiency. Further studies suggest that ASO-loaded sABs (sCABs) are transcytosed by b. End3 (brain microvascular endothelial cells, BMECs) to penetrate the BBB, which is mediated by CD44v6, and eventually taken up by microglial cells in the brain. In a Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) mouse model, sCABs dramatically ameliorate PD symptoms via the anti-inflammatory effect of ASO. This study suggests that sABs from brain metastatic cancer cells are excellent carriers for brain-targeted delivery, as they have not only an extraordinary delivery efficiency but also a much higher scale-up production potential than other EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cancer-derived exosomal miR-138-5p modulates polarization of tumor-associated macrophages through inhibition of KDM6B</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34093857/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Differential activation of macrophages correlates closely with tumor progression, and the epigenetic factor lysine demethylase 6B (KDM6B, previously named JMJD3) mediates the regulation of macrophage polarization through an unknown mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We developed a suspension coculture system comprising breast cancer cells and macrophages and used RT-qPCR and western blotting to measure &lt;em&gt;KDM6B&lt;/em&gt; expression. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays were used to identify candidate microRNAs of cancer cells responsible for the downregulation of KDM6B. To determine if exosomes mediated the transfer of miR-138-5p between cancer cells to macrophages, we treated macrophages with exosomes collected from the conditioned medium of cancer cells. The effects of exosomal miR-138-5p on macrophage polarization were measured using RT-qPCR, flow cytometry, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We employed a mouse model of breast cancer, metastatic to the lung, to evaluate the effects on tumor metastasis of macrophages treated with miR-138-5p-enriched exosomes. To develop a diagnostic evaluation index, the levels of exosomal miR-138-5p in samples from patients with breast cancer were compared to those of controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Coculture of breast cancer cells led to downregulation of &lt;em&gt;KDM6B&lt;/em&gt; expression in macrophages. Cancer cell-derived exosomal miR-138-5p inhibited M1 polarization and promoted M2 polarization through inhibition of &lt;em&gt;KDM6B&lt;/em&gt; expression in macrophages. Macrophages treated with exosomal miR-138-5p promoted lung metastasis, and the level of circulating exosomal miR-138-5p positively correlated with the progression of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our data suggest that miR-138-5p was delivered from breast cancer cells to tumor-associated macrophages via exosomes to downregulate &lt;em&gt;KDM6B&lt;/em&gt; expression, inhibit M1 polarization, and stimulate M2 polarization. Therefore, exosomal miR-138-5p represents a promising prognostic marker and target for the treatment of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeted inhibition of SIRT6 via engineered exosomes impairs tumorigenesis and metastasis in prostate cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/33995674/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients remains a great challenge in the clinic and continuously demands discoveries of new targets and therapies. Here, we assess the function and therapeutic value of SIRT6 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression of SIRT6 was examined in prostate cancer tissue microarray by immunohistochemistry staining. The functions of SIRT6 and underlying mechanisms were elucidated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. We also developed an efficient method to silence SIRT6 by aptamer-modified exosomes carrying small interfering RNA and tested the therapeutic effect in the xenograft mice models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIRT6 expression is positively correlated with prostate cancer progression. Loss of SIRT6 significantly suppressed proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. SIRT6-driven prostate cancer displays activation of multiple cancer-related signaling pathways, especially the Notch pathway. Silencing SIRT6 by siRNA delivered through engineered exosomes inhibited tumor growth and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIRT6 is identified as a driver and therapeutic target for metastatic prostate cancer in our findings, and inhibition of SIRT6 by engineered exosomes can serve as a promising therapeutic tool for clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>hnRNPA2B1 Associated with Recruitment of RNA into Exosomes Plays a Key Role in Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Release from Infected Cells</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hnRNPA2B1, an abundant cellular protein, has been reported to recruit RNAs bearing a specific sequence (EXO motif) into exosomes. We characterized an exosome population averaging 100 ± 50 nm in diameter and containing a defined set of constitutive exosome markers. This population packages microRNAs (miRNAs) and can be directed to block targeted gene expression in a dose-dependent fashion. The objective of this study was to characterize the role of hnRNPA2B1 in the recruitment of miRNA. We report the following four key findings. (i) hnRNPA2B1 is not a component of exosomes produced in HEp-2 or HEK293T cells. Hence, hnRNPA2B1 carries its cargo, at most, to the site of exosome assembly, but it is not itself incorporated into exosomes. (ii) The accumulation of exosomes produced by cells in which the gene encoding hnRNPA2B1 has been knocked out (ΔhnRNPA2B1 cells) was reduced 3-fold. (iii) In uninfected HEp-2 cells, hnRNPA2B1 is localized in the nucleus. In cells infected with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), hnRNPA2B1 was quantitatively exported to the cytoplasm and at least a fraction of hnRNPA2B1 colocalized with a Golgi marker. (iv) Lastly, in ΔhnRNPA2B1 cells, there was a 2- to 3-fold reduction in virus yield but a significant (&amp;gt;10-fold) reduction in HSV-1 released through the apical surface into the extracellular environment. The absence of hnRNPA2B1 had no significant impact on the basolateral export of HSV-1 from infected to uninfected cells by direct cell-to-cell contact. The results suggest that hnRNPA2B1 plays a key role in the transport of enveloped virus from its site of assembly to the extracellular environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this report, we show that hnRNPA2B1 is not a component of exosomes produced in HEp-2 or HEK293T cells. In herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-infected cells, hnRNPA2B1 was quantitatively translocated from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. In infected ΔhnRNPA2B1 cells, Golgi-dependent transport of virus from the apical surface to the extracellular medium was significantly reduced. In essence, this report supports the hypothesis that hnRNPA2B1 plays a key role in the egress of exosomes and HSV-1 from infected cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosome-based delivery of super-repressor IκBα relieves sepsis-associated organ damage and mortality</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As extracellular vesicles that play an active role in intercellular communication by transferring cellular materials to recipient cells, exosomes offer great potential as a natural therapeutic drug delivery vehicle. The inflammatory responses in various disease models can be attenuated through introduction of super-repressor IκB (srIκB), which is the dominant active form of IκBα and can inhibit translocation of nuclear factor κB into the nucleus. An optogenetically engineered exosome system (EXPLOR) that we previously developed was implemented for loading a large amount of srIκB into exosomes. We showed that intraperitoneal injection of purified srIκB-loaded exosomes (Exo-srIκBs) attenuates mortality and systemic inflammation in septic mouse models. In a biodistribution study, Exo-srIκBs were observed mainly in the neutrophils, and in monocytes to a lesser extent, in the spleens and livers of mice. Moreover, we found that Exo-srIκB alleviates inflammatory responses in monocytic THP-1 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The biology, function, and biomedical applications of exosomes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has the potential to identify unknown cellular and molecular mechanisms in intercellular communication and in organ homeostasis and disease. Exosomes, with an average diameter of ~100 nanometers, are a subset of EVs. The biogenesis of exosomes involves their origin in endosomes, and subsequent interactions with other intracellular vesicles and organelles generate the final content of the exosomes. Their diverse constituents include nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, amino acids, and metabolites, which can reflect their cell of origin. In various diseases, exosomes offer a window into altered cellular or tissue states, and their detection in biological fluids potentially offers a multicomponent diagnostic readout. The efficient exchange of cellular components through exosomes can inform their applied use in designing exosome-based therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;
