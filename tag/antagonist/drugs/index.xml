      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristolochic acid I (AAI) is a well established nephrotoxin and human carcinogen. Cytosolic NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) plays an important role in the nitro reduction of aristolochic acids, leading to production of aristoloactam and AA-DNA adduct. Application of a potent NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol is limited by its life-threatening side effect as an anticoagulant and the subsequent hemorrhagic complications. As traditional medicines containing AAI remain available in the market, novel NQO1 inhibitors are urgently needed to attenuate the toxicity of AAI exposure. In this study, we employed comprehensive 2D NQO1 biochromatography to screen candidate compounds that could bind with NQO1 protein. Four compounds, i.e., skullcapflavone II (SFII), oroxylin A, wogonin and tectochrysin were screened out from Scutellaria baicalensis. Among them, SFII was the most promising NQO1 inhibitor with a binding affinity (KD = 4.198 μmol/L) and inhibitory activity (IC50 = 2.87 μmol/L). In human normal liver cell line (L02) and human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2), SFII significantly alleviated AAI-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. In adult mice, oral administration of SFII dose-dependently ameliorated AAI-induced renal fibrosis and dysfunction. In infant mice, oral administration of SFII suppressed AAI-induced hepatocellular carcinoma initiation. Moreover, administration of SFII did not affect the coagulation function in short term in adult mice. In conclusion, SFII has been identified as a novel NQO1 inhibitor that might impede the risk of AAI to kidney and liver without obvious side effect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2b displayed more potent &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; TRPV4 inhibition activity than GSK-Bz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single cell patch-clamp proved that 2b also gave significantly improved potency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2b is a novel and highly potent TRPV4 antagonist &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSK-Bz, a TPRV4 antagonist discovered by GSK, displayed potent in vitro TRPV4 inhibition activity, and demonstrated ability to inhibit TRPV4-mediated pulmonary edema in an &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; rat model. In this study, a series of GSK-Bz derivatives were designed and synthesized based on our previous findings. Compound 2b with cyanocyclobutyl moiety (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 22.65 nM) was found to be 5.3-fold more potent than GSK-Bz (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 121.6 nM) in the calcium imaging experiment. Patch-clamp experiments confirmed that compound 2b (IR = 77.1%) also gave significantly improved potency on TRPV4 currents measured at -60 mV. Furthermore, 2b effectively suppressed the permeability response to LPS in HUVEC with negligible cytotoxicity (CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 100 μM). The &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; protective effects of compounds 2b on acute lung injury were finally assessed in an LPS-induced ALI mice model. Notably, 2b gave better results than HC-067047 against all of the tested indexes (lung W/D ratios, the concentrations of BALF protein and pathological scores), indicating that 2b is a novel and highly potent TRPV4 antagonist which is worth for further development. Currently, evaluation for the drug-like properties of 2b is underway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Buformin alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via inhibiting NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis through an AMPK-dependent pathway</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35132999/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated macrophage pyroptosis plays an important role in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Inhibition of pyroptosis may be a way to alleviate inflammation as well as tissue damage triggered after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The aim of the present study was to explore whether buformin (BF), a hypoglycemic agent, could alleviate sepsis-induced ALI by inhibiting pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Wildtype C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into control group, BF group, LPS group and LPS+BF group. BF group and LPS+BF group were pretreated with BF at a dose of 25 mg/kg, and the changes were observed. In addition, BF was used to interfere with THP-1 cells. The therapeutic effect of BF has been verified by intraperitoneal injection of BF in vivo after LPS stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Inflammation and injury was significantly reduced in BF pretreated mice, and the indexes related to pyroptosis were suppressed. The phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in lung tissues of mice in the BF and LPS+BF groups was significantly higher. In THP-1 cells, the AMPK inhibitor, Compound C was added to demonstrate that BF worked via AMPK to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome. It was further demonstrated that BF up-regulated autophagy, which in turn promoted NLRP3 inflammasome degradation. On the other hand, BF decreased NLRP3 mRNA level by increasing nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). And BF showed a therapeutic effect after LPS challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Our study confirmed that BF inhibited NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in sepsis-induced ALI by up-regulating autophagy and Nrf2 protein level through an AMPK-dependent pathway. This provides a new strategy for clinical mitigation of sepsis-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hybrid &lt;em&gt;trans&lt;/em&gt;-AT PKS/NRPS gene cluster htm was identified with defined boundaries for hangtaimycin biosynthesis in &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces spectabilis&lt;/em&gt; CPCC200148. Deoxyhangtaimycin, a new derivative of hangtaimycin, was identified from the htm11 gene knockout mutant. In vitro biochemical assays demonstrated that the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase Htm11 was responsible for the stereoselective hydroxylation of deoxyhangtaimycin to hangtaimycin. More importantly, deoxyhangtaimycin showed activity against influenza A virus at the micromolar level, highlighting its potential as an antiviral lead compound.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disulfiram inhibits neutrophil extracellular trap formation and protects rodents from acute lung injury and SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35133984/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute lung injury has few treatment options and a high mortality rate. Upon injury, neutrophils infiltrate the lungs and form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), damaging the lungs and driving an exacerbated immune response. Unfortunately, no drug preventing NET formation has completed clinical development. Here, we report that disulfiram - an FDA-approved drug for alcohol use disorder - dramatically reduced NETs, increased survival, improved blood oxygenation, and reduced lung edema in a transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) mouse model. We then tested whether disulfiram could confer protection in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as NETs are elevated in patients with severe COVID-19. In SARS-CoV-2-infected golden hamsters, disulfiram reduced NETs and perivascular fibrosis in the lungs, and it downregulated innate immune and complement/coagulation pathways, suggesting that it could be beneficial for patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, an existing FDA-approved drug can block NET formation and improve disease course in 2 rodent models of lung injury for which treatment options are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ruxolitinib attenuates secondary injury after traumatic spinal cord injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35142693/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation post-traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) induces microglial activation, which leads to prolonged neurological dysfunction. However, the mechanism underlying microglial activation-induced neuroinflammation remains poorly understood. Ruxolitinib (RUX), a selective inhibitor of JAK1/2, was recently reported to inhibit inflammatory storms caused by SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. However, its role in disrupting inflammation post-SCI has not been confirmed. In this study, microglia were treated with RUX for 24 hours and then activated with interferon-γ for 6 hours. The results showed that interferon-γ-induced phosphorylation of JAK and STAT in microglia was inhibited, and the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and cell proliferation marker Ki67 were reduced. In further in vivo experiments, a mouse model of spinal cord injury was treated intragastrically with RUX for 3 successive days, and the findings suggest that RUX can inhibit microglial proliferation by inhibiting the interferon-γ/JAK/STAT pathway. Moreover, microglia treated with RUX centripetally migrated toward injured foci, remaining limited and compacted within the glial scar, which resulted in axon preservation and less demyelination. Moreover, the protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 were reduced. The neuromotor function of SCI mice also recovered. These findings suggest that RUX can inhibit neuroinflammation through inhibiting the interferon-γ/JAK/STAT pathway, thereby reducing secondary injury after SCI and producing neuroprotective effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The murine caspase-11 non-canonical inflammasome responds to various bacterial infections. Caspase-11 activation-induced pyroptosis, in response to cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is critical for endotoxic shock in mice. The mechanism underlying cytosolic LPS sensing and the responsible pattern recognition receptor are unknown. Here we show that human monocytes, epithelial cells and keratinocytes undergo necrosis upon cytoplasmic delivery of LPS. LPS-induced cytotoxicity was mediated by human caspase-4 that could functionally complement murine caspase-11. Human caspase-4 and the mouse homologue caspase-11 (hereafter referred to as caspase-4/11) and also human caspase-5, directly bound to LPS and lipid A with high specificity and affinity. LPS associated with endogenous caspase-11 in pyroptotic cells. Insect-cell purified caspase-4/11 underwent oligomerization upon LPS binding, resulting in activation of the caspases. Underacylated lipid IVa and lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (LPS-RS) could bind to caspase-4/11 but failed to induce their oligomerization and activation. LPS binding was mediated by the CARD domain of the caspase. Binding-deficient CARD-domain point mutants did not respond to LPS with oligomerization or activation and failed to induce pyroptosis upon LPS electroporation or bacterial infections. The function of caspase-4/5/11 represents a new mode of pattern recognition in immunity and also an unprecedented means of caspase activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dihydroartemisinin attenuates pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in rats by suppressing JAK2/STAT3 signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35120332/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has induced a worldwide pandemic since early 2020. COVID-19 causes pulmonary inflammation, secondary pulmonary fibrosis (PF); however, there are still no effective treatments for PF. The present study aimed to explore the inhibitory effect of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) on pulmonary inflammation and PF, and its molecular mechanism. Morphological changes and collagen deposition were analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson staining, and the hydroxyproline content. DHA attenuated early alveolar inflammation and later PF in a bleomycin-induced rat PF model, and inhibited the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 3 (CCL3) in model rat serum. Further molecular analysis revealed that both pulmonary inflammation and PF were associated with increased transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2), and signal transducer and activator 3(STAT3) expression in the lung tissues of model rats. DHA reduced the inflammatory response and PF in the lungs by suppressing TGF-β1, JAK2, phosphorylated (p)-JAK2, STAT3, and p-STAT3. Thus, DHA exerts therapeutic effects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and PF by inhibiting JAK2-STAT3 activation. DHA inhibits alveolar inflammation, and attenuates lung injury and fibrosis, possibly representing a therapeutic candidate to treat PF associated with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FGF10 protects against particulate matter (PM)-induced lung injury via regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35114441/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Particulate matter (PM)-induced lung injury is closely related to the development of respiratory diseases, and the genotoxicity of PM involves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ERS lays the basis of PM-induced lung injury characteristic of secretion of inflammatory mediators from bronchial epithelial cells, and fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) protects against PM-induced lung injury through regulation of ERS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The regulatory mechanism of FGF10 on ERS in PM-induced lung injury involves ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure of the lungs to particulate matter (PM) leads to the development of respiratory disease and involves mechanisms such as oxydative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, there are no effective therapies to treat PM-induced lung diseases. Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) is a multifunctional growth factor mediating mesenchymal-to-epithelial signaling and displaying a significant therapeutic potential following injury. The present research aims to investigate the regulatory mechanism of FGF10 on ER stress in PM-induced lung injury. PM-induced lung injury leads to peribronchial wall thickening and marked infiltration of inflammatory cells which is associated with increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines. The results show that FGF10 treatment attenuates PM-induced lung injury in vivo and reversed ER stress protein GRP78 and CHOP levels. Moreover, comparison of human bronchial epithelial cells cultured with PM and FGF10 vs PM alone shows sustained cell proliferation and restrained secretion of inflammatory cytokines supporting FGF10&amp;rsquo;s protective role. Significantly, both ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT inhibitors largely abolished the impact of FGF10 on PM-induced ER stress. Taken together, both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that FGF10, via the activation of ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling, protects against PM-induced lung injury through the regulation of ER stress. Therefore, FGF10 represents a potential therapy for PM-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Repurposed Drug Screen for Compounds Regulating Aquaporin 5 Stability in Lung Epithelial Cells</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35145418/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquaporin 5 (AQP5) is expressed in several cell types in the lung and regulates water transport, which contributes to barrier function during injury and the composition of glandular secretions. Reduced AQP5 expression is associated with barrier dysfunction during acute lung injury, and strategies to enhance its expression are associated with favorable phenotypes. Thus, pharmacologically enhancing AQP5 expression could be beneficial. Here, we optimized a high-throughput assay designed to detect AQP5 abundance using a cell line stably expressing bioluminescent-tagged AQP5. We then screened a library of 1153 compounds composed of FDA-approved drugs for their effects on AQP5 abundance. We show compounds Niclosamide, Panobinostat, and Candesartan Celexitil increased AQP5 abundance, and show that Niclosamide has favorable cellular toxicity profiles. We determine that AQP5 levels are regulated in part by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in lung epithelial cells, and mechanistically Niclosamide increases AQP5 levels by reducing AQP5 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Functionally, Niclosamide stabilized AQP5 levels in response to hypotonic stress, a stimulus known to reduce AQP5 levels. In complementary assays, Niclosamide increased endogenous AQP5 in both A549 cells and in primary, polarized human bronchial epithelial cells compared to control-treated cells. Further, we measured rapid cell volume changes in A549 cells in response to osmotic stress, an effect controlled by aquaporin channels. Niclosamide-treated A549 cell volume changes occurred more rapidly compared to control-treated cells, suggesting that increased Niclosamide-mediated increases in AQP5 expression affects functional water transport. Taken together, we describe a strategy to identify repurposed compounds for their effect on AQP5 protein abundance. We validated the effects of Niclosamide on endogenous AQP5 levels and in regulating cell-volume changes in response to tonicity changes. Our findings highlight a unique approach to screen for drug effects on protein abundance, and our workflow can be applied broadly to study compound effects on protein abundance in lung epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
