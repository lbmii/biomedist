      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is still associated with high mortality. Growing evidence suggests that Club Cell Protein 16 (CC16) plays a protective role against ALI. However, the doses of recombinant CC16 (rCC16) used in preclinical studies are supraphysiological for clinical applications. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanovesicles endogenously generated by mammalian cells. Our study demonstrated that CC16 is released via small EVs and EV-encapsulated CC16 (sEV-CC16) has anti-inflammatory activities, which protect mice from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or bacteria-induced ALI. Additionally, sEV-CC16 can activate the DNA damage repair signaling pathways. Consistent with this activity, we observed more severe DNA damage in lungs from Cc16 knockout (KO) than wild-type (WT) mice. Mechanistically, we elucidated that CC16 suppresses NF-κB signaling activation by binding to Heat Shock Protein 60 (HSP60). We concluded that sEV-CC16 could be a potential therapeutic agent for ALI by inhibiting the inflammatory and DNA damage responses by reducing NF-κB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor-Activatable Nanoparticles Target Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor to Enhance Drug Delivery and Antitumor Efficacy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binding of plasma proteins to nanomedicines is widely considered detrimental to their delivery to tumors. Here, the design of OxPt/SN38 nanoparticle containing a hydrophilic oxaliplatin (OxPt) prodrug in a coordination polymer core and a hydrophobic cholesterol-conjugated SN38 prodrug on the lipid shell for active tumor targeting is reported. OxPt/SN38 hitchhikes on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, concentrates in tumors via LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis, and selectively releases SN38 and OxPt in acidic, esterase-rich, and reducing tumor microenvironments, leading to 6.0- and 4.9-times higher accumulations in tumors over free drugs. By simultaneously crosslinking DNA and inhibiting topoisomerase I, OxPt/SN38 achieved 92-98% tumor growth inhibition in five colorectal cancer tumor models and prolonged mouse survival by 58-80 days compared to free drug controls in three human colorectal cancer tumor models without causing serious side effects. The study has uncovered a novel nanomedicine strategy to co-deliver combination chemotherapies to tumors via active targeting of the LDL receptor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ROS-responsive polymer nanoparticles with enhanced loading of dexamethasone effectively modulate the lung injury microenvironment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disorder associated with cytokine storm, which activates various reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathways and causes severe complications in patients as currently seen in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is an urgent need for medication of the inflammatory lung environment and effective delivery of drugs to lung to reduce the burden of high doses of medications and attenuate inflammatory cells and pathways. Herein, we prepared dexamethasone-loaded ROS-responsive polymer nanoparticles (PFTU@DEX NPs) by a modified emulsion approach, which achieved high loading content of DEX (11.61 %). DEX was released faster from the PFTU@DEX NPs in a ROS environment, which could scavenge excessive ROS efficiently both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. The PFTU NPs and PFTU@DEX NPs showed no hemolysis and cytotoxicity. Free DEX, PFTU NPs and PFTU@DEX NPs shifted M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages in RAW264.7 cells, and showed anti-inflammatory modulation to A549 cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. The PFTU@DEX NPs treatment significantly reduced the increased total protein concentration in BALF of ALI mice. The delivery of PFTU@DEX NPs decreased the proportion of neutrophils significantly, mitigated the cell apoptosis remarkably compared to the other groups, reduced M1 macrophages and increased M2 macrophages &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Moreover, the PFTU@DEX NPs had the strongest ability to suppress the expression of NLRP3, Caspase1, and IL-1β. Therefore, the PFTU@DEX NPs could efficiently suppress inflammatory cells, ROS signaling pathways, and cell apoptosis to ameliorate LPS-induced ALI. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disorder associated with cytokine storm, which activates various reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathways and causes severe complications in patients. There is an urgent need for medication of the inflammatory lung environment and effective delivery of drugs to modulate the inflammatory disorder and suppress the expression of ROS and inflammatory cytokines. The inhaled PFTU@DEX NPs prepared through a modified nanoemulsification method suppressed the activation of NLRP3, induced the polarization of macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2, and thereby reduced the neutrophil infiltration, inhibited the release of proteins and inflammatory mediators, and thus decreased the acute lung injury &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uptake of Functional Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles in 3D Gut Cell Models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35712760/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2 nm) easily penetrate the membranes of intestinal murine epithelial cells (MODE-K) and colorectal cancer cells (CT-26). They are also taken up by 3D spheroids (400 µm) of these cell types and primary gut organoids (500 µm). In contrast, dissolved dyes are not taken up by any of these cells or 3D structures. The distribution of fluorescent ultrasmall gold nanoparticles inside cells, spheroids, and gut organoids is examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Nanoparticles conjugated with the cytostatic drug doxorubicin and a fluorescent dye exhibit significantly greater cytotoxicity toward CT-26 tumor spheroids than equally concentrated dissolved doxorubicin, probably because they enter the interior of a spheroid much more easily than dissolved doxorubicin. Comprehensive analyses show that the cellular uptake of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles occurs by different endocytosis pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel inhalable quercetin-alginate nanogel as a promising therapy for acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35690763/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Acute lung injury (ALI), a severe health-threatening disease, has a risk of causing chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Informative and powerful evidence suggests that inflammation and oxidative stress play a central role in the pathogenesis of ALI. Quercetin is well recognized for its excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which showed great potential for ALI treatment. However, the application of quercetin is often hindered by its low solubility and bioavailability. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, an inhalable quercetin-alginate nanogel (QU-Nanogel) was fabricated, and by this special &amp;ldquo;material-drug&amp;rdquo; structure, the solubility and bioavailability of quercetin were significantly enhanced, which could further increase the activity of quercetin and provide a promising therapy for ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; QU-Nanogel is a novel alginate and quercetin based &amp;ldquo;material-drug&amp;rdquo; structural inhalable nanogel, in which quercetin was stabilized by hydrogen bonding to obtain a &amp;ldquo;co-construct&amp;rdquo; water-soluble nanogel system, showing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. QU-Nanogel has an even distribution in size of less than 100 nm and good biocompatibility, which shows a stronger protective and antioxidant effect in vitro. Tissue distribution results provided evidence that the QU-Nanogel by ultrasonic aerosol inhalation is a feasible approach to targeted pulmonary drug delivery. Moreover, QU-Nanogel was remarkably reversed ALI rats by relieving oxidative stress damage and acting the down-regulation effects of mRNA and protein expression of inflammation cytokines via ultrasonic aerosol inhalation administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; In the ALI rat model, this novel nanogel showed an excellent therapeutic effect by ultrasonic aerosol inhalation administration by protecting and reducing pulmonary inflammation, thereby preventing subsequent pulmonary fibrosis. This work demonstrates that this inhalable QU-Nanogel may function as a promising drug delivery strategy in treating ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
