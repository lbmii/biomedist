      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular DNA traps (ETs) represent an immune response by which cells release essential materials like chromatin and granular proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that the transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays a crucial role in atherosclerosis. This study seeks to investigate the interaction between CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; VSMCs and the formation of ETs and highlight its function in atherosclerosis. Here we show that ETs are inhibited, and atherosclerotic plaque formation is alleviated in male Myh11&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;Pad4&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt; mice undergoing an adeno-associated-virus-8 (AAV8) mediating overexpression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 mutation (PCSK9) injection and being challenged with a high-fat diet. Obvious ETs generated from CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; VSMCs are inhibited by Cl-amidine and DNase I in vitro. By utilizing VSMCs-lineage tracing technology and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we demonstrate that the ETs from CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; VSMCs influence the progress of atherosclerosis by regulating the direction of VSMCs&amp;rsquo; transdifferentiation through STING-SOCS1 or TLR4 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activation of Pancreatic Acinar FXR Protects against Pancreatitis via Osgin1-Mediated Restoration of Efficient Autophagy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pancreatitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in gastroenterology, and no medications are available for treating this disease in current clinical practice. FXR plays an anti-inflammatory role in diverse inflammatory diseases, while its function in pancreatitis remains unknown. In this study, we initially observed a marked increase of nuclear FXR in pancreatic tissues of human patients with pancreatitis. Deleting the FXR in pancreatic acinar cells (FXR&lt;sup&gt;acinarΔ/Δ &lt;/sup&gt;) led to more severe pancreatitis in mouse models of caerulein-induced acute and chronic pancreatitis, while the FXR agonist GW4064 significantly attenuated pancreatitis in caerulein or arginine-induced acute pancreatitis and caerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis. FXR deletion impaired the viability and stress responses of pancreatic exocrine organoids (PEOs) in vitro. Utilizing RNA-seq and ChIP-seq of PEOs, we identified &lt;em&gt;Osgin1&lt;/em&gt; as a direct target of FXR in the exocrine pancreas, which was also increasingly expressed in human pancreatitis tissues compared to normal pancreatic tissues. Pancreatic knockdown of &lt;em&gt;Osgin1&lt;/em&gt; by AAV-pan abolished the therapeutic effects of FXR activation on pancreatitis, whereas pancreatic overexpression of &lt;em&gt;Osgin1&lt;/em&gt; effectively alleviated caerulein-induced pancreatitis. Mechanistically, we found that the FXR-OSGIN1 axis stimulated autophagic flux in the pancreatic tissues and cell lines, which was considered as the intrinsic mechanisms through which FXR-OSGIN1 protecting against pancreatitis. Our results highlight the protective role of the FXR-OSGIN1 axis in pancreatitis and provided a new target for the treatment of this disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AAV vectors: The Rubik&#39;s cube of human gene therapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36203359/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defective genes account for ∼80% of the total of more than 7,000 diseases known to date. Gene therapy brings the promise of a one-time treatment option that will fix the errors in patient genetic coding. Recombinant viruses are highly efficient vehicles for in vivo gene delivery. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors offer unique advantages, such as tissue tropism, specificity in transduction, eliciting of a relatively low immune responses, no incorporation into the host chromosome, and long-lasting delivered gene expression, making them the most popular viral gene delivery system in clinical trials, with three AAV-based gene therapy drugs already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA). Despite the success of AAV vectors, their usage in particular scenarios is still limited due to remaining challenges, such as poor transduction efficiency in certain tissues, low organ specificity, pre-existing humoral immunity to AAV capsids, and vector dose-dependent toxicity in patients. In the present review, we address the different approaches to improve AAV vectors for gene therapy with a focus on AAV capsid selection and engineering, strategies to overcome anti-AAV immune response, and vector genome design, ending with a glimpse at vector production methods and the current state of recombinant AAV (rAAV) at the clinical level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Product Is Involved in the Inflammatory Response of Human Adenovirus-Infected Patients</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35875560/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human adenovirus (HAdV) infection causes excessive inflammation associated with severe tissue injury, such as pneumonia. The molecules involved in the underlying inflammatory mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) is mainly expressed on immune cells and lung tissues, and it is a key factor in the initiation and development of inflammation. RAGE can be cleaved by metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) to release the extracellular segment, which is named soluble RAGE (sRAGE), into the intercellular space, where it can bind to RAGE ligands and block RAGE activation and subsequent inflammation. In our study, we enrolled HAdV-infected patients and their contacts to examine the relationship between sRAGE and inflammation induced by HAdV infection. The results showed that HAdV infection stimulated inflammatory cytokine secretion, increased such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels, and suppressed sRAGE expression. sRAGE levels were significantly different between patients with or without pneumonia. We also found that MMP9 was significantly lower in patients with pneumonia, and it was positively correlated with sRAGE levels over 7 days after disease onset. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is an important immune activation signaling pathway that is regulated by RAGE. We observed the activation of the MAPK pathway in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients. Negative correlations between sRAGE and phosphorylated JNK and p38 were observed. These results suggest that sRAGE is involved in HAdV-induced inflammatory responses, and might be a potential therapeutic target to alleviate the HAdV-induced excessive inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A High-Efficiency AAV for Endothelial Cell Transduction Throughout the Central Nervous System</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35571675/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endothelial cells have a crucial role in nervous system function, and mounting evidence points to endothelial impairment as a major contributor to a wide range of neurological diseases. However, tools to genetically interrogate these cells in vivo remain limited. Here, we describe AAV-BI30, a capsid that specifically and efficiently transduces endothelial cells throughout the central nervous system. At relatively low systemic doses, this vector transduces the majority of arterial, capillary, and venous endothelial cells in the brain, retina, and spinal cord vasculature of adult C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, we show that AAV-BI30 robustly transduces endothelial cells in multiple mouse strains and rats in vivo and human brain microvascular endothelial cells in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate AAV-BI30&amp;rsquo;s capacity to achieve efficient and endothelial-specific Cre-mediated gene manipulation in the central nervous system. This combination of attributes makes AAV-BI30 uniquely well-suited to address outstanding research questions in neurovascular biology and aid the development of therapeutics to remediate endothelial dysfunction in disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene delivery was recently approved for the treatment of inherited blindness and spinal muscular atrophy, and long-term therapeutic effects have been achieved for other rare diseases, including haemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, current research indicates that the genetic modification of AAV vectors may further facilitate the success of AAV gene therapy. Vector engineering can increase AAV transduction efficiency (by optimizing the transgene cassette), vector tropism (using capsid engineering) and the ability of the capsid and transgene to avoid the host immune response (by genetically modifying these components), as well as optimize the large-scale production of AAV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are the leading platform for gene delivery for the treatment of a variety of human diseases. Recent advances in developing clinically desirable AAV capsids, optimizing genome designs and harnessing revolutionary biotechnologies have contributed substantially to the growth of the gene therapy field. Preclinical and clinical successes in AAV-mediated gene replacement, gene silencing and gene editing have helped AAV gain popularity as the ideal therapeutic vector, with two AAV-based therapeutics gaining regulatory approval in Europe or the United States. Continued study of AAV biology and increased understanding of the associated therapeutic challenges and limitations will build the foundation for future clinical success.&lt;/p&gt;
