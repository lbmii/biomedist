      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the first tumor virus discovered in humans and can cause various types of tumors. Molecular classification suggests that EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) is a unique subtype of gastric cancer.EBV was also the first virus found to encode its own microRNAs. However, the functions of many miRNAs remain unknown. This study investigated the roles and targets of miR-BART2-5p (BART2-5p) and miR-BART11-5p (BART11-5p) in EBVaGC. The expression of RB and p21 in EBVaGC and EBV negative GC (EBVnGC) cells was evaluated by western blotting. Expression of BART2-5p and BART11-5p in EBVaGC cells was evaluated by droplet digital PCR. The effects of BART2-5p or BART11-5p and their potential mechanisms were further investigated using cell counting kit-8, colony formation assay, flow cytometry analysis, and transwell assay. BART2-5p and BART11-5p were abundantly expressed and RB and p21 were downregulated in EBVaGC cells. BART2-5p regulates RB and p21 expression by directly targeting them. BART11-5p regulates RB expression by directly targeting RB. Both BART2-5p and BART11-5p promoted proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells, while inhibiting apoptosis and promoting S-phase arrest of the cell cycle. Thus, BART2-5p and BART11-5p play important roles in promoting proliferation and migration, and inhibiting apoptosis in EBVaGC by targeting RB and p21, thus providing new potential therapeutic targets for EBVaGC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facts and Hopes in the Relationship of EBV with Cancer Immunity and Immunotherapy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the first identified human tumor virus, infects and takes up residency in almost every human. However, EBV genome-positive tumors arise in only a tiny minority of infected people, presumably when the virus-carrying tumor cells are able to evade immune surveillance. Traditional views regard viral antigens as the principal targets of host immune surveillance against virus-infected cells. However, recent findings indicate that EBV-infected/-transformed B cells elicit both cytotoxic CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell responses against a wide range of overexpressed cellular antigens known to function as tumor-associated antigens (TAA), in addition to various EBV-encoded antigens. This not only broadens the ways by which the immune system controls EBV infection and prevents it from causing cancers, but also potentially extends immune protection toward EBV-unrelated cancers by targeting shared TAAs. The goal of this review is to incorporate these new findings with literature data and discuss future directions for improved understanding of EBV-induced antitumor immunity, as well as the hopes for rational immune strategies for cancer prevention and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
