      <title>Generation and multiomic profiling of a TP53/CDKN2A double-knockout gastroesophageal junction organoid model</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes tumor protein p53 (&lt;em&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt;) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (&lt;em&gt;CDKN2A&lt;/em&gt;) occurs early during gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) tumorigenesis. However, because of a paucity of GEJ-specific disease models, cancer-promoting consequences of &lt;em&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CDKN2A&lt;/em&gt; inactivation at the GEJ have not been characterized. Here, we report the development of a wild-type primary human GEJ organoid model and a CRISPR-edited transformed GEJ organoid model. CRISPR-Cas9–mediated &lt;em&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CDKN2A&lt;/em&gt; knockout (&lt;em&gt;TP53/CDKN2A&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) in GEJ organoids induced morphologic dysplasia and proneoplastic features in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Lipidomic profiling identified several platelet-activating factors (PTAFs) among the most up-regulated lipids in CRISPR-edited organoids. PTAF/PTAF receptor (PTAFR) abrogation by siRNA knockdown or a pharmacologic inhibitor (WEB2086) reduced proliferation and other proneoplastic features of &lt;em&gt;TP53/CDKN2A&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; GEJ organoids in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. In addition, murine xenografts of Eso26, an established human esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line, were suppressed by WEB2086. Mechanistically, &lt;em&gt;TP53/CDKN2A&lt;/em&gt; dual inactivation disrupted both the transcriptome and the DNA methylome, likely mediated by key transcription factors, particularly forkhead box M1 (FOXM1). FOXM1 activated &lt;em&gt;PTAFR&lt;/em&gt; transcription by binding to the &lt;em&gt;PTAFR&lt;/em&gt; promoter, further amplifying the PTAF-PTAFR pathway. Together, these studies established a robust model system for investigating early GEJ neoplastic events, identified crucial metabolic and epigenomic changes occurring during GEJ model tumorigenesis, and revealed a potential cancer therapeutic strategy. This work provides insights into proneoplastic mechanisms associated with &lt;em&gt;TP53/CDKN2A&lt;/em&gt; inactivation in early GEJ neoplasia, which may facilitate early diagnosis and prevention of GEJ neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lipid metabolism-related lncRNA SLC25A21-AS1 promotes the progression of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating the NPM1/c-Myc axis and SLC25A21 expression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35735113/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Obesity alters metabolic microenvironment and is thus associated with several tumours. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role, molecular mechanism of action, and potential clinical value of lipid metabolism-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SLC25A21-AS1 in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A high-fat diets (HFDs)-induced obesity nude mouse model was established, and targeted metabolomics analysis was used to identify critical medium-long chain fatty acids influencing the growth of ESCC cells. Transcriptomic analysis of public dataset GSE53625 confirmed that lncRNA SLC25A21-AS1 was a lipid metabolism-related lncRNA. The biological function of lncRNA SLC25A21-AS1 in ESCC was investigated both in vivo and in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation(ChIP)assay, RNA-pull down, mass spectrometry, co-IP, and RNA IP(RIP) were performed to explore the molecular mechanism. Finally, an ESCC cDNA microarray was used to determine the clinical prognostic value of SLC25A21-AS1 by RT-qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Palmitic acid (PA) is an important fatty acid component of HFD and had an inhibitory effect on ESCC cell lines. LncRNA SLC25A21-AS1 expression was downregulated by PA and associated with the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SLC25A21-AS1 interacted with nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1) protein to promote the downstream gene transcription of the c-Myc in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, SLC25A21-AS1 maintained the stability of SLC25A21 mRNA and reduced the intracellular NAD+ /NADH ratio by influencing tryptophan catabolism. Finally, we demonstrated that high expression of SLC25A21-AS1 promoted resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and was correlated with poor tumour grade and overall survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; HFD/PA has an inhibitory effect on ESCC cells and SLC25A21-AS1 expression. SLC25A21-AS1 promotes the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells by regulating the NPM1/c-Myc axis and SLC25A21 expression. In addition, lncRNA SLC25A21-AS1 may serve as a favourable prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for ESCC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multi-omic characterization of genome-wide abnormal DNA methylation reveals diagnostic and prognostic markers for esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses are intracellular pathogens that hijack host cell machinery and resources to replicate. Rather than being constant, host physiology is rhythmic, undergoing circadian (∼24 h) oscillations in many virus-relevant pathways, but whether daily rhythms impact on viral replication is unknown. We find that the time of day of host infection regulates virus progression in live mice and individual cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that herpes and influenza A virus infections are enhanced when host circadian rhythms are abolished by disrupting the key clock gene transcription factor Bmal1. Intracellular trafficking, biosynthetic processes, protein synthesis, and chromatin assembly all contribute to circadian regulation of virus infection. Moreover, herpesviruses differentially target components of the molecular circadian clockwork. Our work demonstrates that viruses exploit the clockwork for their own gain and that the clock represents a novel target for modulating viral replication that extends beyond any single family of these ubiquitous pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nucleic acid aptamer controls mycoplasma infection for inhibiting the malignancy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35189346/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esophageal cancer is one of the most frequent malignant tumors of the digestive tract, among which esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the main pathological type worldwide. Previous studies have shown microbial infections in the upper digestive tract to be a potential risk factor in ESCC etiology. In this study, we identified that Mycoplasma hyorhinis infection promoted the malignancy of ESCC. In response, we generated a single-stranded DNA aptamer, ZY3A, against M. hyorhinis using the cell-SELEX strategy. The underlying recognition mechanism of ZY3A on M. hyorhinis involves its binding to M. hyorhinis-specific p37 protein. This tool allowed us to provide the first proof-of-concept evidence using a nucleic acid aptamer to control mycoplasma infection. More specifically, we found that ZY3A could neutralize M. hyorhinis infection on ESCC cells by blocking the interaction between p37 protein and its receptor TLR4 on the ESCC cell membrane. As a result, ZY3A inhibited the migration and invasion of M. hyorhinis-infected ESCC cells in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Taken together, these findings indicate that aptamer ZY3A is a potential candidate for development into a novel molecular tool for treatment of M. hyorhinis infection and a safe first-in-class M. hyorhinis-targeting antitumor agent.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ATXN2-mediated translation of TNFR1 promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via m6A-dependent manner</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34995801/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) is the most prevalent RNA modification, and the effect of its dysregulation on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) development remains unclear. Here, by performing transcriptome-wide m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A sequencing in 16 ESCC tissue samples, we identified the key roles of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A in TNFRSF1A (also known as TNFR1)-mediated MAPK and NF-κB activation in ESCC. Mechanistically, a functional protein involved in m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation, ATXN2, is identified that augments the translation of TNFRSF1A by binding to m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-modified TNFRSF1A mRNA. Upregulation of the TNFRSF1A protein level, a vital upstream switch for TNFRSF1A-mediated signaling events, activates the NF-κB and MAPK pathways and thus promotes ESCC development. Furthermore, TNFRSF1A m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modifications and protein levels are upregulated in ESCC, and high levels of TNFRSF1A m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A and protein are correlated with poor ESCC patient survival. These results collectively indicate that the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-TNFRSF1A axis is critical for ESCC development and thus may serve as a potential druggable target.&lt;/p&gt;
