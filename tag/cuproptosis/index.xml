      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS-RAF-MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)&amp;ndash;a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Copper homeostasis and cuproptosis in health and disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an essential micronutrient, copper is required for a wide range of physiological processes in virtually all cell types. Because the accumulation of intracellular copper can induce oxidative stress and perturbing cellular function, copper homeostasis is tightly regulated. Recent studies identified a novel copper-dependent form of cell death called cuproptosis, which is distinct from all other known pathways underlying cell death. Cuproptosis occurs via copper binding to lipoylated enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which leads to subsequent protein aggregation, proteotoxic stress, and ultimately cell death. Here, we summarize our current knowledge regarding copper metabolism, copper-related disease, the characteristics of cuproptosis, and the mechanisms that regulate cuproptosis. In addition, we discuss the implications of cuproptosis in the pathogenesis of various disease conditions, including Wilson&amp;rsquo;s disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, and we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting cuproptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Copper induces cell death by targeting lipoylated TCA cycle proteins</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Erratum in:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq4855&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Copper induces cell death by targeting lipoylated TCA cycle proteins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper is an essential cofactor for all organisms, and yet it becomes toxic if concentrations exceed a threshold maintained by evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanisms. How excess copper induces cell death, however, is unknown. Here, we show in human cells that copper-dependent, regulated cell death is distinct from known death mechanisms and is dependent on mitochondrial respiration. We show that copper-dependent death occurs by means of direct binding of copper to lipoylated components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This results in lipoylated protein aggregation and subsequent iron-sulfur cluster protein loss, which leads to proteotoxic stress and ultimately cell death. These findings may explain the need for ancient copper homeostatic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copper induces cell death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell death is an essential, finely tuned process that is critical for the removal of damaged and superfluous cells. Multiple forms of programmed and nonprogrammed cell death have been identified, including apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis. Tsvetkov et al. investigated whether abnormal copper ion elevations may sensitize cells toward a previously unidentified death pathway (see the Perspective by Kahlson and Dixon). By performing CRISPR/Cas9 screens, several genes were identified that could protect against copper-induced cell killing. Using genetically modified cells and a mouse model of a copper overload disorder, the researchers report that excess copper promotes the aggregation of lipoylated proteins and links mitochondrial metabolism to copper-dependent death.&lt;/p&gt;
