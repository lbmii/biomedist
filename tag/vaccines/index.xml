      <title>Peptide Vaccine Against ADAMTS-7 Ameliorates Atherosclerosis and Postinjury Neointima Hyperplasia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The metalloprotease ADAMTS-7 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 7) is a novel locus associated with human coronary atherosclerosis. ADAMTS-7 deletion protects against atherosclerosis and vascular restenosis in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We designed 3 potential vaccines consisting of distinct B cell epitopic peptides derived from ADAMTS-7 and conjugated with the carrier protein KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) as well as aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. Arterial ligation or wire injury was used to induce neointima in mice, whereas &lt;em&gt;ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LDLR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (low-density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR) mice fed a high-fat diet were applied to assess atherosclerosis. In addition, coronary stent implantation was performed on vaccine-immunized Bama miniature pigs, followed by optical coherence tomography to evaluate coronary intimal hyperplasia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A vaccine, ATS7vac, was screened out from 3 candidates to effectively inhibit intimal thickening in murine carotid artery ligation models after vaccination. As well, immunization with ATS7vac alleviated neointima formation in murine wire injury models and mitigated atherosclerotic lesions in both hyperlipidemic &lt;em&gt;ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LDLR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice without lowering lipid levels. Preclinically, ATS7vac markedly impeded intimal hyperplasia in swine stented coronary arteries, but without significant immune-related organ injuries. Mechanistically, ATS7vac vaccination produced specific antibodies against ADAMTS-7, which markedly repressed ADAMTS-7-mediated COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein) and TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) degradation and subsequently inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell migration but promoted re-endothelialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; ATS7vac is a novel atherosclerosis vaccine that also alleviates in-stent restenosis. The application of ATS7vac would be a complementary therapeutic avenue to the current lipid-lowering strategy for atherosclerotic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel viral vaccine platform based on engineered transfer RNA</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36482724/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, an increasing number of emerging and remerging virus outbreaks have occurred and the rapid development of vaccines against these viruses has been crucial. Controlling the replication of premature termination codon (PTC)-containing viruses is a promising approach to generate live but replication-defective viruses that can be used for potent vaccines. Here, we used anticodon-engineered transfer RNAs (ACE-tRNAs) as powerful precision switches to control the replication of PTC-containing viruses. We showed that ACE-tRNAs display higher potency of reading through PTCs than genetic code expansion (GCE) technology. Interestingly, ACE-tRNA has a site preference that may influence its read-through efficacy. We further attempted to use ACE-tRNAs as a novel viral vaccine platform. Using a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pseudotyped virus as an RNA virus model, we found that ACE-tRNAs display high potency for read-through viral PTCs and precisely control their production. Pseudorabies virus (PRV), a herpesvirus, was used as a DNA virus model. We found that ACE-tRNAs display high potency for reading through viral PTCs and precisely controlling PTC-containing virus replication. In addition, PTC-engineered PRV completely attenuated and lost virulence in mice in vivo, and immunization with PRV containing a PTC elicited a robust immune response and provided complete protection against wild-type PRV challenge. Overall, replication-controllable PTC-containing viruses based on ACE-tRNAs provide a new strategy to rapidly attenuate virus infection and prime robust immune responses. This technology can be used as a platform for rapidly developing viral vaccines in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Splenic-targeting biomimetic nanovaccine for elevating protective immunity against virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463277/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The prevalence of viral infectious diseases has become a serious threat to public safety, economic and social development. Vaccines have been served as the most effective platform to prevent virus transmission via the activation of host immune responses, while the low immunogenicity or safety, the high cost of production, storage, transport limit their effective clinical application. Therefore, there is a need to develop a promising strategy to improve the immunogenicity and safety of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We developed a splenic-targeting biomimetic nanovaccine (NV) that can boost protective humoral and cellular immunity against african swine fever virus (ASFV) infection. The universal PLGA nanoparticles (CMR-PLGA/p54 NPs) coated with mannose and CpG (TLR9 agonist) co-modified red blood cell (RBC) membrane were prepared, which comprised a viral antigen (p54) and can be served as a versatile nanovaccine for elevating protective immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CMR-PLGA/p54 NVs could be effectively uptaken by BMDC and promoted BMDC maturation in vitro. After subcutaneous immunization, antigen could be effectively delivered to the splenic dendritic cells (DCs) due to the splenic homing ability of RBC and DC targeting capacity of mannose, which promoted antigen presentation and DCs maturation, and further elicited higher levels of cytokines secretion and specific IgG titers, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells activation and B maturation. Moreover, NVs demonstrated notable safety during the immunization period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study demonstrates the high potential of CMR-PLGA NPs as vaccine delivery carriers to promote humoral and cellular immune responses, and it provides a promising strategy to develop safe and effective vaccines against viral infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A multivalent nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine against all known influenza virus subtypes</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36423275/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seasonal influenza vaccines offer little protection against pandemic influenza virus strains. It is difficult to create effective prepandemic vaccines because it is uncertain which influenza virus subtype will cause the next pandemic. In this work, we developed a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA)-lipid nanoparticle vaccine encoding hemagglutinin antigens from all 20 known influenza A virus subtypes and influenza B virus lineages. This multivalent vaccine elicited high levels of cross-reactive and subtype-specific antibodies in mice and ferrets that reacted to all 20 encoded antigens. Vaccination protected mice and ferrets challenged with matched and mismatched viral strains, and this protection was at least partially dependent on antibodies. Our studies indicate that mRNA vaccines can provide protection against antigenically variable viruses by simultaneously inducing antibodies against multiple antigens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNA cancer vaccines drive immunity in hard-to-treat malignancies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36168634/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36168634/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine outperforms other kinds of cancer immunotherapy due to its high response rates, easy preparation, and wide applicability, which is considered as one of the most promising forms of next-generation cancer therapies. However, the inherent instability and insufficient protein expression duration of mRNA limit the efficacy and widespread application of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we first tested the possibility of a novel circular RNA (circRNA) platform for protein expression and compare its duration with linear RNA. Then, we developed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) system for circRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo. Next, the innate and adaptive immune response of circRNA-LNP complex was evaluated in vivo. The anti-tumor efficacy of circRNA-LNP was further confirmed in three tumor models. Finally, the possibility of combination therapy with circRNA-LNP and adoptive cell transfer therapy was further investigated in a late-stage tumor model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We successfully increased the stability of the RNA vaccine by circularizing the linear RNA molecules to form highly stable circRNA molecules which exhibited durable protein expression ability. By encapsulating the antigen-coding circRNA in LNP enabling in vivo expression, we established a novel circRNA vaccine platform, which was capable of triggering robust innate and adaptive immune activation and showed superior anti-tumor efficacy in multiple mouse tumor models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, our circRNA vaccine platform provides a novel prospect for the development of cancer RNA vaccines in a wide range of hard-to-treat malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35460644/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/35460644/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly stable circRNA vaccines induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircRNA vaccines elicit a high proportion of neutralizing antibodies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircRNA vaccines enable effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and monkeys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircRNARBD-Delta vaccine provides broad-spectrum protection against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to drive the worldwide pandemic, there is a constant demand for vaccines that offer more effective and broad-spectrum protection. Here, we report a circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine that elicited potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses by expressing the trimeric RBD of the spike protein, providing robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 in both mice and rhesus macaques. Notably, the circRNA vaccine enabled higher and more durable antigen production than the 1mΨ-modified mRNA vaccine and elicited a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies and distinct Th1-skewed immune responses. Importantly, we found that the circRNARBD-Omicron vaccine induced effective neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron but not the Delta variant. In contrast, the circRNARBD-Delta vaccine protected against both Delta and Omicron or functioned as a booster after two doses of either native- or Delta-specific vaccination, making it a favorable choice against the current variants of concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enantiomer-dependent immunological response to chiral nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35046606/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality is a unifying structural metric of biological and abiological forms of matter. Over the past decade, considerable clarity has been achieved in understanding the chemistry and physics of chiral inorganic nanoparticles; however, little is known about their effects on complex biochemical networks. Intermolecular interactions of biological molecules and inorganic nanoparticles show some commonalities, but these structures differ in scale, in geometry and in the dynamics of chiral shapes, which can both impede and strengthen their mirror-asymmetric complexes. Here we show that achiral and left- and right-handed gold biomimetic nanoparticles show different &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; immune responses. We use irradiation with circularly polarized light (CPL) to synthesize nanoparticles with controllable nanometre-scale chirality and optical anisotropy factors (g-factors) of up to 0.4. We find that binding of nanoparticles to two proteins from the family of adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (AGPCRs)-namely cluster-of-differentiation 97 (CD97) and epidermal-growth-factor-like-module receptor 1 (EMR1)-results in the opening of mechanosensitive potassium-efflux channels, the production of immune signalling complexes known as inflammasomes, and the maturation of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells. Both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; immune responses depend monotonically on the g-factors of the nanoparticles, indicating that nanoscale chirality can be used to regulate the maturation of immune cells. Finally, left-handed nanoparticles show substantially higher (1,258-fold) efficiency compared with their right-handed counterparts as adjuvants for vaccination against the H9N2 influenza virus, opening a path to the use of nanoscale chirality in immunology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective Zika vaccines engineered to eliminate enhancement of dengue infection via immunodominance switch</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/34267374/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is an important safety concern for vaccine development against dengue virus (DENV) and its antigenically related Zika virus (ZIKV) because vaccine may prime deleterious antibodies to enhance natural infections. Cross-reactive antibodies targeting the conserved fusion loop epitope (FLE) are known as the main sources of ADE. We design ZIKV immunogens engineered to change the FLE conformation but preserve neutralizing epitopes. Single vaccination conferred sterilizing immunity against ZIKV without ADE of DENV-serotype 1-4 infections and abrogated maternal-neonatal transmission in mice. Unlike the wild-type-based vaccine inducing predominately cross-reactive ADE-prone antibodies, B cell profiling revealed that the engineered vaccines switched immunodominance to dispersed patterns without DENV enhancement. The crystal structure of the engineered immunogen showed the dimeric conformation of the envelope protein with FLE disruption. We provide vaccine candidates that will prevent both ZIKV infection and infection-/vaccination-induced DENV ADE.&lt;/p&gt;
