      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced mRNA vaccines play vital roles against SARS-CoV-2. However, most current mRNA delivery platforms need to be stored at -20 °C or -70 °C due to their poor stability, which severely restricts their availability. Herein, we develop a lyophilization technique to prepare SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccines with long-term thermostability. The physiochemical properties and bioactivities of lyophilized vaccines showed no change at 25 °C over 6 months, and the lyophilized SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines could elicit potent humoral and cellular immunity whether in mice, rabbits, or rhesus macaques. Furthermore, in the human trial, administration of lyophilized Omicron mRNA vaccine as a booster shot also engendered strong immunity without severe adverse events, where the titers of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron BA.1/BA.2/BA.4 were increased by at least 253-fold after a booster shot following two doses of the commercial inactivated vaccine, CoronaVac. This lyophilization platform overcomes the instability of mRNA vaccines without affecting their bioactivity and significantly improves their accessibility, particularly in remote regions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vaccination with Span, an antigen guided by SARS-CoV-2 S protein evolution, protects against challenge with viral variants in mice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 continues to accumulate mutations to evade immunity, leading to breakthrough infections after vaccination. How researchers can anticipate the evolutionary trajectory of the virus in advance in the design of next-generation vaccines requires investigation. Here, we performed a comprehensive study of 11,650,487 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein evolved not randomly but into directional paths of either high infectivity plus low immune resistance or low infectivity plus high immune resistance. The viral infectivity and immune resistance of variants are generally incompatible, except for limited variants such as Beta and Kappa. The Omicron variant has the highest immune resistance but showed high infectivity in only one of the tested cell lines. To provide cross-clade immunity against variants that undergo diverse evolutionary pathways, we designed a new pan-vaccine antigen (S&lt;sub&gt;pan&lt;/sub&gt;). S&lt;sub&gt;pan&lt;/sub&gt; was designed by analyzing the homology of 2675 SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequences from the NCBI database before the Delta variant emerged. The refined S&lt;sub&gt;pan&lt;/sub&gt; protein harbors high-frequency residues at given positions that reflect cross-clade generality in sequence evolution. Compared with a prototype wild-type (S&lt;sub&gt;wt&lt;/sub&gt;) vaccine, which, when administered to mice, induced serum with decreased neutralization activity against emerging variants, S&lt;sub&gt;pan&lt;/sub&gt; vaccination of mice elicited broad immunity to a wide range of variants, including those that emerged after our design. Moreover, vaccinating mice with a heterologous S&lt;sub&gt;pan&lt;/sub&gt; booster conferred complete protection against lethal infection with the Omicron variant. Our results highlight the importance and feasibility of a universal vaccine to fight against SARS-CoV-2 antigenic drift.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Peptide Vaccine Against ADAMTS-7 Ameliorates Atherosclerosis and Postinjury Neointima Hyperplasia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36562301/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36562301/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The metalloprotease ADAMTS-7 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 7) is a novel locus associated with human coronary atherosclerosis. ADAMTS-7 deletion protects against atherosclerosis and vascular restenosis in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We designed 3 potential vaccines consisting of distinct B cell epitopic peptides derived from ADAMTS-7 and conjugated with the carrier protein KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) as well as aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. Arterial ligation or wire injury was used to induce neointima in mice, whereas &lt;em&gt;ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LDLR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (low-density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR) mice fed a high-fat diet were applied to assess atherosclerosis. In addition, coronary stent implantation was performed on vaccine-immunized Bama miniature pigs, followed by optical coherence tomography to evaluate coronary intimal hyperplasia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; A vaccine, ATS7vac, was screened out from 3 candidates to effectively inhibit intimal thickening in murine carotid artery ligation models after vaccination. As well, immunization with ATS7vac alleviated neointima formation in murine wire injury models and mitigated atherosclerotic lesions in both hyperlipidemic &lt;em&gt;ApoE&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LDLR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice without lowering lipid levels. Preclinically, ATS7vac markedly impeded intimal hyperplasia in swine stented coronary arteries, but without significant immune-related organ injuries. Mechanistically, ATS7vac vaccination produced specific antibodies against ADAMTS-7, which markedly repressed ADAMTS-7-mediated COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein) and TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) degradation and subsequently inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell migration but promoted re-endothelialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; ATS7vac is a novel atherosclerosis vaccine that also alleviates in-stent restenosis. The application of ATS7vac would be a complementary therapeutic avenue to the current lipid-lowering strategy for atherosclerotic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A novel viral vaccine platform based on engineered transfer RNA</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36482724/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, an increasing number of emerging and remerging virus outbreaks have occurred and the rapid development of vaccines against these viruses has been crucial. Controlling the replication of premature termination codon (PTC)-containing viruses is a promising approach to generate live but replication-defective viruses that can be used for potent vaccines. Here, we used anticodon-engineered transfer RNAs (ACE-tRNAs) as powerful precision switches to control the replication of PTC-containing viruses. We showed that ACE-tRNAs display higher potency of reading through PTCs than genetic code expansion (GCE) technology. Interestingly, ACE-tRNA has a site preference that may influence its read-through efficacy. We further attempted to use ACE-tRNAs as a novel viral vaccine platform. Using a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pseudotyped virus as an RNA virus model, we found that ACE-tRNAs display high potency for read-through viral PTCs and precisely control their production. Pseudorabies virus (PRV), a herpesvirus, was used as a DNA virus model. We found that ACE-tRNAs display high potency for reading through viral PTCs and precisely controlling PTC-containing virus replication. In addition, PTC-engineered PRV completely attenuated and lost virulence in mice in vivo, and immunization with PRV containing a PTC elicited a robust immune response and provided complete protection against wild-type PRV challenge. Overall, replication-controllable PTC-containing viruses based on ACE-tRNAs provide a new strategy to rapidly attenuate virus infection and prime robust immune responses. This technology can be used as a platform for rapidly developing viral vaccines in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Splenic-targeting biomimetic nanovaccine for elevating protective immunity against virus infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36463277/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; The prevalence of viral infectious diseases has become a serious threat to public safety, economic and social development. Vaccines have been served as the most effective platform to prevent virus transmission via the activation of host immune responses, while the low immunogenicity or safety, the high cost of production, storage, transport limit their effective clinical application. Therefore, there is a need to develop a promising strategy to improve the immunogenicity and safety of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; We developed a splenic-targeting biomimetic nanovaccine (NV) that can boost protective humoral and cellular immunity against african swine fever virus (ASFV) infection. The universal PLGA nanoparticles (CMR-PLGA/p54 NPs) coated with mannose and CpG (TLR9 agonist) co-modified red blood cell (RBC) membrane were prepared, which comprised a viral antigen (p54) and can be served as a versatile nanovaccine for elevating protective immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; CMR-PLGA/p54 NVs could be effectively uptaken by BMDC and promoted BMDC maturation in vitro. After subcutaneous immunization, antigen could be effectively delivered to the splenic dendritic cells (DCs) due to the splenic homing ability of RBC and DC targeting capacity of mannose, which promoted antigen presentation and DCs maturation, and further elicited higher levels of cytokines secretion and specific IgG titers, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells activation and B maturation. Moreover, NVs demonstrated notable safety during the immunization period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study demonstrates the high potential of CMR-PLGA NPs as vaccine delivery carriers to promote humoral and cellular immune responses, and it provides a promising strategy to develop safe and effective vaccines against viral infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A multivalent nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine against all known influenza virus subtypes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seasonal influenza vaccines offer little protection against pandemic influenza virus strains. It is difficult to create effective prepandemic vaccines because it is uncertain which influenza virus subtype will cause the next pandemic. In this work, we developed a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA)-lipid nanoparticle vaccine encoding hemagglutinin antigens from all 20 known influenza A virus subtypes and influenza B virus lineages. This multivalent vaccine elicited high levels of cross-reactive and subtype-specific antibodies in mice and ferrets that reacted to all 20 encoded antigens. Vaccination protected mice and ferrets challenged with matched and mismatched viral strains, and this protection was at least partially dependent on antibodies. Our studies indicate that mRNA vaccines can provide protection against antigenically variable viruses by simultaneously inducing antibodies against multiple antigens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNA cancer vaccines drive immunity in hard-to-treat malignancies</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36168634/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/article/36168634/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale:&lt;/em&gt; Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine outperforms other kinds of cancer immunotherapy due to its high response rates, easy preparation, and wide applicability, which is considered as one of the most promising forms of next-generation cancer therapies. However, the inherent instability and insufficient protein expression duration of mRNA limit the efficacy and widespread application of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we first tested the possibility of a novel circular RNA (circRNA) platform for protein expression and compare its duration with linear RNA. Then, we developed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) system for circRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo. Next, the innate and adaptive immune response of circRNA-LNP complex was evaluated in vivo. The anti-tumor efficacy of circRNA-LNP was further confirmed in three tumor models. Finally, the possibility of combination therapy with circRNA-LNP and adoptive cell transfer therapy was further investigated in a late-stage tumor model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We successfully increased the stability of the RNA vaccine by circularizing the linear RNA molecules to form highly stable circRNA molecules which exhibited durable protein expression ability. By encapsulating the antigen-coding circRNA in LNP enabling in vivo expression, we established a novel circRNA vaccine platform, which was capable of triggering robust innate and adaptive immune activation and showed superior anti-tumor efficacy in multiple mouse tumor models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, our circRNA vaccine platform provides a novel prospect for the development of cancer RNA vaccines in a wide range of hard-to-treat malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The generation of stem cell-like memory cells early after BNT162b2 vaccination is associated with durability of memory CD8&#43; T cell responses</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35839774/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spike-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells quantitatively decrease 6 months after BNT162b2 vaccination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; cells are successfully generated by BNT162b2 vaccination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; cell generation significantly correlates with the durability of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; cell generation inversely correlates with the age of vaccinated individuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines elicit humoral and cellular immune responses. Durable maintenance of vaccine-induced immunity is required for long-term protection of the host. Here, we examine activation and differentiation of vaccine-induced CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells using MHC class I (MHC-I) multimers and correlations between early differentiation and the durability of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses among healthcare workers immunized with two doses of BNT162b2. The frequency of MHC-I multimer&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells is robustly increased by BNT162b2 but decreases 6 months post-second vaccination to 2.4%-65.6% (23.0% on average) of the peak. MHC-I multimer&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells dominantly exhibit phenotypes of activated effector cells 1-2 weeks post-second vaccination and gradually acquire phenotypes of long-term memory cells, including stem cell-like memory T (T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt;) cells. Importantly, the frequency of T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; cells 1-2 weeks post-second vaccination significantly correlates with the 6-month durability of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, indicating that early generation of T&lt;sub&gt;SCM&lt;/sub&gt; cells determines the longevity of vaccine-induced memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNA: An emerging frontier in RNA therapeutic targets, RNA therapeutics, and mRNA vaccines</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35649485/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNA) is a class of natural (biogenic) or synthetic closed RNA without 5&amp;rsquo; or 3&amp;rsquo; ends. Meanwhile, their unique covalently-closed structures of circRNA prevent RNA degradation by exonucleases, thereby empowering them with high pharmaceutical stability and biostability relative to current standard-of-care linear mRNA. Natural circRNA can be non-coding RNAs as well as protein-coding RNA, the latter of which was recently discovered. The physiological functions of biogenic circRNAs, which largely remain elusive, include protein and gene sponges, cell activity modulators, and protein translation. The discovery that the circRNA levels can be correlated with some human diseases empowers circRNA with the potential as a novel type of disease biomarkers and a noncanonical class of therapeutic targets. Recently, synthetic circRNA have been engineered to explore their applications as a novel class of mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of the biogenesis and physiological functions of natural circRNAs, the approaches to circRNA synthesis, and current research in the exploration of endogenous circRNAs as novel therapeutic targets and testing circRNAs as an emerging class of RNA therapeutics and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Personalized immunotherapy utilizing cancer vaccines tailored to the tumors of individual patients holds promise for tumors with high genetic heterogeneity, potentially enabling eradication of the tumor in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; Here, we demonstrate a general strategy for biological nanovaccines that trigger tailored tumor-specific immune responses for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Dendritic cell (DC)-derived exosomes (DEX) are painted with a HCC-targeting peptide (P47-P), an α-fetoprotein epitope (AFP212-A2) and a functional domain of high mobility group nucleosome-binding protein 1 (N1ND-N), an immunoadjuvant for DC recruitment and activation, via an exosomal anchor peptide to form a &amp;ldquo;trigger&amp;rdquo; DEX vaccine (DEX&lt;sub&gt;P&amp;amp;A2&amp;amp;N&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; DEX&lt;sub&gt;P&amp;amp;A2&amp;amp;N&lt;/sub&gt; specifically promoted recruitment, accumulation and activation of DCs in mice with orthotopic HCC tumor, resulting in enhanced cross-presentation of tumor neoantigens and de novo T cell response. DEX&lt;sub&gt;P&amp;amp;A2&amp;amp;N&lt;/sub&gt; elicited significant tumor retardation and tumor-specific immune responses in HCC mice with large tumor burdens. Importantly, tumor eradication was achieved in orthotopic HCC mice when antigenic AFP peptide was replaced with the full-length AFP (A) to form DEX&lt;sub&gt;P&amp;amp;A&amp;amp;N&lt;/sub&gt;. Supplementation of Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand greatly augmented the antitumor immunity of DEX&lt;sub&gt;P&amp;amp;A&amp;amp;N&lt;/sub&gt; by increasing immunological memory against tumor re-challenge in orthotopic HCC mice. Depletion of T cells, cross-presenting DCs and other innate immune cells abrogated the functionality of DEX&lt;sub&gt;P&amp;amp;A&amp;amp;N&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; These findings demonstrate the capacity of universal DEX vaccines to induce tumor-specific immune responses by triggering an immune response tailored to the tumors of each individual, thus presenting a generalizable approach for personalized immunotherapy of HCC, by extension of other tumors, without the need to identify tumor antigens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Differential Dual-Release Bilayer Microneedles Loaded with Aluminum Adjuvants as a Safe and Effective Vaccine Platform</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/adfm.202201952/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum adjuvants are currently the most widely used adjuvants for human vaccines. However, concerns about their safety, such as local irritation at the vaccination site and potential neurotoxicity, have been raised over recent years. Herein, the bilayer microneedles are fabricated using commercially available materials and a simple micromolding preparation method in a differential dual-release manner for sustained antigen release in the outer layer, and fast release of aluminum in the inner layer. The outer layer here replaces aluminum adjuvants to form an antigen depot, and the rapidly released adjuvants of the inner layer can activate dendritic cells, which effectively reduces the amount of aluminum while retaining their effect. The use of ovalbumin in vivo as the model antigen demonstrates that compared with subcutaneous and intramuscular injections, the bilayer microneedles achieve effective humoral immunity and relatively balanced immune response with less aluminum (1/25 of the dose), which may be related to the mechanical adjuvant effect of the microneedles. Mice treated with the bilayer microneedles show little to no aluminum accumulation in different organs, and no local irritation such as granuloma is observed. The superior vaccination safety and strong immunity using bilayer microneedles make it a promising vaccine platform.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Potent Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Efficacy of COVID-19 Hyperimmune Globulin from Vaccine-Immunized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35403837/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains a global public health threat. Hence, more effective and specific antivirals are urgently needed. Here, COVID-19 hyperimmune globulin (COVID-HIG), a passive immunotherapy, is prepared from the plasma of healthy donors vaccinated with BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine). COVID-HIG shows high-affinity binding to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein, the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the N-terminal domain of the S protein, and the nucleocapsid protein; and blocks RBD binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Pseudotyped and authentic virus-based assays show that COVID-HIG displays broad-spectrum neutralization effects on a wide variety of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including D614G, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Kappa (B.1.617.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) in vitro. However, a significant reduction in the neutralization titer is detected against Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants. Additionally, assessments of the prophylactic and treatment efficacy of COVID-HIG in an Adv5-hACE2-transduced IFNAR-/- mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection show significantly reduced weight loss, lung viral loads, and lung pathological injury. Moreover, COVID-HIG exhibits neutralization potency similar to that of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin from pooled convalescent plasma. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of COVID-HIG against SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide reference for subsequent clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35460644/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly stable circRNA vaccines induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircRNA vaccines elicit a high proportion of neutralizing antibodies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircRNA vaccines enable effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and monkeys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircRNARBD-Delta vaccine provides broad-spectrum protection against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to drive the worldwide pandemic, there is a constant demand for vaccines that offer more effective and broad-spectrum protection. Here, we report a circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine that elicited potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses by expressing the trimeric RBD of the spike protein, providing robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 in both mice and rhesus macaques. Notably, the circRNA vaccine enabled higher and more durable antigen production than the 1mΨ-modified mRNA vaccine and elicited a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies and distinct Th1-skewed immune responses. Importantly, we found that the circRNARBD-Omicron vaccine induced effective neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron but not the Delta variant. In contrast, the circRNARBD-Delta vaccine protected against both Delta and Omicron or functioned as a booster after two doses of either native- or Delta-specific vaccination, making it a favorable choice against the current variants of concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mannan-decorated pathogen-like polymeric nanoparticles as nanovaccine carriers for eliciting superior anticancer immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35364489/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using nanotechnology for cancer vaccine design holds great promise because of the intrinsic feature of nanoparticles in being captured by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). However, there are still obstacles in current nanovaccine systems in achieving efficient tumor therapeutic effects, which could partially be attributed to the unsatisfactory vaccine carrier design. Herein, we report a mannan-decorated pathogen-like polymeric nanoparticle as a protein vaccine carrier for eliciting robust anticancer immunity. This nanovaccine was constructed as a core-shell structure with mannan as the shell, polylactic acid-polyethylenimine (PLA-PEI) assembled nanoparticle as the core, and protein antigens and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG absorbed onto the PLA-PEI core via electrostatic interactions. Compared to other hydrophilic materials, mannan decoration could greatly enhance the lymph node draining ability of the nanovaccine and promote the capturing by the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dendritic cells (DCs) in the lymph node, while PLA-PEI as the inner core could enhance antigen endosome escape thus promoting the antigen cross-presentation. In addition, mannan itself as a TLR4 agonist could synergize with CpG for maximally activating the DCs. Excitingly, we observed in several murine tumor models that using this nanovaccine alone could elicit robust immune response in vivo and result in superior anti-tumor effects with 50% of mice completely cured. This study strongly evidenced that mannan decoration and a rationally designed nanovaccine system could be quite robust in tumor vaccine therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BCG vaccination provides protection against IAV but not SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35235831/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BCG vaccination provides significant protection against IAV in mice and hamsters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BCG provides no protection against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and hamsters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 induces pulmonary hemorrhage and disseminates to the bone marrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monocytes from BCG-vaccinated humans induce more cytokines to IAV than SARS-CoV-2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the vast majority of species solely rely on innate immunity for host defense, it stands to reason that a critical evolutionary trait like immunological memory evolved in this primitive branch of our immune system. There is ample evidence that vaccines such as bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induce protective innate immune memory responses (trained immunity) against heterologous pathogens. Here we show that while BCG vaccination significantly reduces morbidity and mortality against influenza A virus (IAV), it fails to provide protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In contrast to IAV, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to unique pulmonary vasculature damage facilitating viral dissemination to other organs, including the bone marrow (BM), a central site for BCG-mediated trained immunity. Finally, monocytes from BCG-vaccinated individuals mount an efficient cytokine response to IAV infection, while this response is minimal following SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our data suggest that the protective capacity of BCG vaccination is contingent on viral pathogenesis and tissue tropism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A chitosan-mediated inhalable nanovaccine against SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35126879/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with several antigenic variants, has grown into a global challenge, and the rapid establishment of an immune barrier is crucial to achieving long-term control of the virus. This has led to a great demand for easy preparation and scalable vaccines, especially in low-income countries. Here, we present an inhalable nanovaccine comprising chitosan and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The chitosan-mediated nanovaccine enabled a strong spike-specific antibody immune response and augmented local mucosal immunity in bronchoalveolar lavage and lungs, which might be capable of protecting the host from infection without systemic toxicity. In addition, the enhanced adaptive immunity stimulated by chitosan showed potential protection against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, inhalation of the nanovaccine induced a comparable antibody response compared to intramuscular injection. This inhalable nanovaccine against SARS-CoV-2 offers a convenient and compliant strategy to reduce the use of needles and the need for medical staff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enantiomer-dependent immunological response to chiral nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/35046606/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality is a unifying structural metric of biological and abiological forms of matter. Over the past decade, considerable clarity has been achieved in understanding the chemistry and physics of chiral inorganic nanoparticles; however, little is known about their effects on complex biochemical networks. Intermolecular interactions of biological molecules and inorganic nanoparticles show some commonalities, but these structures differ in scale, in geometry and in the dynamics of chiral shapes, which can both impede and strengthen their mirror-asymmetric complexes. Here we show that achiral and left- and right-handed gold biomimetic nanoparticles show different &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; immune responses. We use irradiation with circularly polarized light (CPL) to synthesize nanoparticles with controllable nanometre-scale chirality and optical anisotropy factors (g-factors) of up to 0.4. We find that binding of nanoparticles to two proteins from the family of adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (AGPCRs)-namely cluster-of-differentiation 97 (CD97) and epidermal-growth-factor-like-module receptor 1 (EMR1)-results in the opening of mechanosensitive potassium-efflux channels, the production of immune signalling complexes known as inflammasomes, and the maturation of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells. Both &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; immune responses depend monotonically on the g-factors of the nanoparticles, indicating that nanoscale chirality can be used to regulate the maturation of immune cells. Finally, left-handed nanoparticles show substantially higher (1,258-fold) efficiency compared with their right-handed counterparts as adjuvants for vaccination against the H9N2 influenza virus, opening a path to the use of nanoscale chirality in immunology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global pandemics caused by influenza or coronaviruses cause severe disruptions to public health and lead to high morbidity and mortality. There remains a medical need for vaccines against these pathogens. CMV (cytomegalovirus) is a β-herpesvirus that induces uniquely robust immune responses in which remarkably large populations of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are maintained for a lifetime. Hence, CMV has been proposed and investigated as a novel vaccine vector for expressing antigenic peptides or proteins to elicit protective cellular immune responses against numerous pathogens. We generated two recombinant murine CMV (MCMV) vaccine vectors expressing hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus (MCMVHA) or the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (MCMVS). A single injection of MCMVs expressing either viral protein induced potent neutralizing antibody responses, which strengthened over time. Importantly, MCMVHA-vaccinated mice were protected from illness following challenge with the influenza virus, and we excluded that this protection was due to the effects of memory T cells. Conclusively, we show here that MCMV vectors induce not only long-term cellular immunity but also humoral responses that provide long-term immune protection against clinically relevant respiratory pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trained immunity induction by the inactivated mucosal vaccine MV130 protects against experimental viral respiratory infections</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MV130 is an inactivated polybacterial mucosal vaccine that confers protection to patients against recurrent respiratory infections, including those of viral etiology. However, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we find that intranasal prophylaxis with MV130 modulates the lung immune landscape and provides long-term heterologous protection against viral respiratory infections in mice. Intranasal administration of MV130 provides protection against systemic candidiasis in wild-type and Rag1-deficient mice lacking functional lymphocytes, indicative of innate immune-mediated protection. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of trained immunity with metformin abrogates the protection conferred by MV130 against influenza A virus respiratory infection. MV130 induces reprogramming of both mouse bone marrow progenitor cells and in vitro human monocytes, promoting an enhanced cytokine production that relies on a metabolic shift. Our results unveil that the mucosal administration of a fully inactivated bacterial vaccine provides protection against viral infections by a mechanism associated with the induction of trained immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique antibody profiles are induced by six distinct vaccine platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correlates of protection against RSV differ by compartment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IgA levels, neutralization, and complement are key in the upper respiratory tract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fc-effector functions correlate with RSV restriction in the lower respiratory tract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of respiratory illness in infants and the elderly. Although several vaccines have been developed, none have succeeded in part due to our incomplete understanding of the correlates of immune protection. While both T cells and antibodies play a role, emerging data suggest that antibody-mediated mechanisms alone may be sufficient to provide protection. Therefore, to map the humoral correlates of immunity against RSV, antibody responses across six different vaccines were profiled in a highly controlled nonhuman primate-challenge model. Viral loads were monitored in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and machine learning was used to determine the vaccine platform-agnostic antibody features associated with protection. Upper respiratory control was associated with virus-specific IgA levels, neutralization, and complement activity, whereas lower respiratory control was associated with Fc-mediated effector mechanisms. These findings provide critical compartment-specific insights toward the rational development of future vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protective Zika vaccines engineered to eliminate enhancement of dengue infection via immunodominance switch</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is an important safety concern for vaccine development against dengue virus (DENV) and its antigenically related Zika virus (ZIKV) because vaccine may prime deleterious antibodies to enhance natural infections. Cross-reactive antibodies targeting the conserved fusion loop epitope (FLE) are known as the main sources of ADE. We design ZIKV immunogens engineered to change the FLE conformation but preserve neutralizing epitopes. Single vaccination conferred sterilizing immunity against ZIKV without ADE of DENV-serotype 1-4 infections and abrogated maternal-neonatal transmission in mice. Unlike the wild-type-based vaccine inducing predominately cross-reactive ADE-prone antibodies, B cell profiling revealed that the engineered vaccines switched immunodominance to dispersed patterns without DENV enhancement. The crystal structure of the engineered immunogen showed the dimeric conformation of the envelope protein with FLE disruption. We provide vaccine candidates that will prevent both ZIKV infection and infection-/vaccination-induced DENV ADE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung-Targeted Transgene Expression of Nanocomplexed Ad5 Enhances Immune Response in the Presence of Preexisting Immunity</title>
      <link>https://example.com/article/36714358/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vector has been widely applied in vaccine development targeting infectious diseases, such as Ebola virus disease and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the high prevalence of preexisting anti-vector immunity compromises the immunogenicity of Ad5-based vaccines. Thus, there is a substantial unmet need to minimize preexisting immunity while improving the insert-induced immunity of Ad5 vectors. Herein, we address this need by utilizing biocompatible nanoparticles to modulate Ad5-host interactions. We show that positively charged human serum albumin nanoparticles ((+)HSAnp), which are capable of forming a complex with Ad5, significantly increase the transgene expression of Ad5 in both coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor-positive and -negative cells. Furthermore, in charge- and dose-dependent manners, Ad5/(+)HSAnp complexes achieve robust (up to 227-fold higher) and long-term (up to 60 days) transgene expression in the lungs of mice following intranasal instillation. Importantly, in the presence of preexisting anti-Ad5 immunity, complexed Ad5-based Ebola and COVID-19 vaccines significantly enhance antigen-specific humoral response and mucosal immunity. These findings suggest that viral aggregation and charge modification could be leveraged to engineer enhanced viral vectors for vaccines and gene therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
