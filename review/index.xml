      <title>The Circadian Biology of Heart Failure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driven by autonomous molecular clocks that are synchronized by a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, cardiac physiology fluctuates in diurnal rhythms that can be partly or entirely circadian. Cardiac contractility, metabolism, and electrophysiology, all have diurnal rhythms, as does the neurohumoral control of cardiac and kidney function. In this review, we discuss the evidence that circadian biology regulates cardiac function, how molecular clocks may relate to the pathogenesis of heart failure, and how chronotherapeutics might be applied in heart failure. Disrupting molecular clocks can lead to heart failure in animal models, and the myocardial response to injury seems to be conditioned by the time of day. Human studies are consistent with these findings, and they implicate the clock and circadian rhythms in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Certain circadian rhythms are maintained in patients with heart failure, a factor that can guide optimal timing of therapy. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic manipulation of circadian rhythms and molecular clocks show promise in the prevention and treatment of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNAs at the intersection of cancer and heart disease: potential therapeutic targets in cardio-oncology</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36651915/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerable progress has been made for managing cancer, however, with these advancements, comes the discovery of previously unknown adverse events. In particular, the prolonged lifespan of patients has uncovered severe cardiotoxic side effects of widely used anticancer therapies, which restrict their administration and thus compromise the success of the seemingly most suitable treatments in large cancer patient cohorts. Vice versa, cardiovascular diseases can also promote both the onset and progression of different cancers, highlighting that both conditions are deeply interlinked. Recognizing these close interactions, the novel interdisciplinary field of cardio-oncology has emerged to closely study these uniquely correlating diseases. In this regard, non-coding RNAs are gaining increasing attention since they constitute crucial regulators in many physiological but also pathological signaling pathways, including those of cancer and cardiac dysfunction. In this review, we focus on the new subtype of non-coding RNA, circular RNAs, in their distinct exchange within cardio-oncology and discuss their suitability as potent targets for the simultaneous treatment of cardiac dysfunction and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antiviral Approaches against Influenza Virus</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36645300/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preventing and controlling influenza virus infection remains a global public health challenge, as it causes seasonal epidemics to unexpected pandemics. These infections are responsible for high morbidity, mortality, and substantial economic impact. Vaccines are the prophylaxis mainstay in the fight against influenza. However, vaccination fails to confer complete protection due to inadequate vaccination coverages, vaccine shortages, and mismatches with circulating strains. Antivirals represent an important prophylactic and therapeutic measure to reduce influenza-associated morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-risk populations. Here, we review current FDA-approved influenza antivirals with their mechanisms of action, and different viral- and host-directed influenza antiviral approaches, including immunomodulatory interventions in clinical development. Furthermore, we also illustrate the potential utility of machine learning in developing next-generation antivirals against influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulatory T cell and macrophage crosstalk in acute lung injury: future perspectives</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36646692/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) describes the injury to endothelial cells in the lungs and associated vessels due to various factors. Furthermore, ALI accompanied by inflammation and thrombosis has been reported as a common complication of SARS-COV-2 infection. It is widely accepted that inflammation and the cytokine storm are main causes of ALI. Two classical anti-inflammatory cell types, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2 macrophages, are theoretically capable of resisting uncontrolled inflammation. Recent studies have indicated possible crosstalk between Tregs and macrophages involving their mutual activation. In this review, we discuss the current findings related to ALI pathogenesis and the role of Tregs and macrophages. In particular, we review the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between Tregs and macrophages in ALI pathogenesis. Understanding the role of Tregs and macrophages will provide the potential targets for treating ALI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and macrophages are responsible for acute lung injury (ALI) progression through pro-/anti-inflammatory cell balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tregs and macrophages influence each other to potentiate their roles in ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the mutual interaction, new application of conventional drugs and novel insights of ALI treatment are generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The specific Tregâ€“macrophage crosslink in different stage of ALI needs more investigations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The curative effects of application of conventional drugs and new immunological therapy should be performed in precise clinical verifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proper control of Treg or M2 macrophage expansion in ALI treatment expects further studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial stress and mitokines in aging</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36642986/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/36642986/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitokines are signaling molecules that enable communication of local mitochondrial stress to other mitochondria in distant cells and tissues. Among those molecules are FGF21, GDF15 (both expressed in the nucleus) and several mitochondrial-derived peptides, including humanin. Their responsiveness to mitochondrial stress induces mitokine-signaling in response for example to exercise, following mitochondrial challenges in skeletal muscle. Such signaling is emerging as an important mediator of exercise-derived and dietary strategy-related molecular and systemic health benefits, including healthy aging. A compensatory increase in mitokine synthesis and secretion could preserve mitochondrial function and overall cellular vitality. Conversely, resistance against mitokine actions may also develop. Alterations of mitokine-levels, and therefore of mitokine-related inter-tissue cross talk, are associated with general aging processes and could influence the development of age-related chronic metabolic, cardiovascular and neurological diseases; whether these changes contribute to aging or represent &amp;ldquo;rescue factors&amp;rdquo; remains to be conclusively shown. The aim of the present review is to summarize the expanding knowledge on mitokines, the potential to modulate them by lifestyle and their involvement in aging and age-related diseases. We highlight the importance of well-balanced mitokine-levels, the preventive and therapeutic properties of maintaining mitokine homeostasis and sensitivity of mitokine signaling but also the risks arising from the dysregulation of mitokines. While reduced mitokine levels may impair inter-organ crosstalk, also excessive mitokine concentrations can have deleterious consequences and are associated with conditions such as cancer and heart failure. Preservation of healthy mitokine signaling levels can be achieved by regular exercise and is associated with an increased lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Humanized mouse models for immuno-oncology research</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36635480/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment paradigm for many malignancies and is transforming the drug development landscape. Although immunotherapeutic agents have demonstrated clinical efficacy, they are associated with variable clinical responses, and substantial gaps remain in our understanding of their mechanisms of action and specific biomarkers of response. Currently, the number of preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate interactions between the human immune system and tumours and enable evaluation of human-specific immunotherapies in vivo is limited. Humanized mice, a term that refers to immunodeficient mice co-engrafted with human tumours and immune components, provide several advantages for immuno-oncology research. In this Review, we discuss the benefits and challenges of the currently available humanized mice, including specific interactions between engrafted human tumours and immune components, the development and survival of human innate immune populations in these mice, and approaches to study mice engrafted with matched patient tumours and immune cells. We highlight the latest advances in the generation of humanized mouse models, with the aim of providing a guide for their application to immuno-oncology studies with potential for clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humanized mouse models of cancer are immunodeficient mice co-engrafted with human tumours and immune cells, and are used in immuno-oncology research with potential for clinical translation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The limitations of humanized mouse models include restricted development of mature innate immune cells, a lack of HLA molecules, limited ability to generate antigen-specific antibody responses, and a dearth of lymph node structures and germinal centres.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the complexity of generating humanized mice for experimental studies, the advantages and limitations of each specific model need to be carefully considered and assessed to ensure the highest probability of an effective study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next-generation humanized mouse models are being generated to better recapitulate the development of human innate and adaptive immunity. The development and use of novel humanized mouse platforms will accelerate the discovery and testing of new immunotherapies for patients with cancer.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Single Molecule Localization Microscopy for Studying Small Extracellular Vesicles</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36635058/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are 30-200 nm nanovesicles enriched with unique cargoes of nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins. sEVs are released by all cell types and have emerged as a critical mediator of cell-to-cell communication. Although many studies have dealt with the role of sEVs in health and disease, the exact mechanism of sEVs biogenesis and uptake remain unexplored due to the lack of suitable imaging technologies. For sEVs functional studies, imaging has long relied on conventional fluorescence microscopy that has only 200-300 nm resolution, thereby generating blurred images. To break this resolution limit, recent developments in super-resolution microscopy techniques, specifically single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), expanded the understanding of subcellular details at the few nanometer level. SMLM success relies on the use of appropriate fluorophores with excellent blinking properties. In this review, the basic principle of SMLM is highlighted and the state of the art of SMLM use in sEV biology is summarized. Next, how SMLM techniques implemented for cell imaging can be translated to sEV imaging is discussed by applying different labeling strategies to study sEV biogenesis and their biomolecular interaction with the distant recipient cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil, neutrophil extracellular traps and endothelial cell dysfunction in sepsis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36629024/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a persistent systemic inflammatory condition involving multiple organ failures resulting from a dysregulated immune response to infection, and one of the hallmarks of sepsis is endothelial dysfunction. During its progression, neutrophils are the first line of innate immune defence against infection. Aside from traditional mechanisms, such as phagocytosis or the release of inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species and other antibacterial substances, activated neutrophils also release web-like structures composed of tangled decondensed DNA, histone, myeloperoxidase and other granules called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which can efficiently ensnare bacteria in the circulation. In contrast, excessive neutrophil activation and NET release may induce endothelial cells to shift toward a pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant phenotype. Furthermore, neutrophils and NETs can degrade glycocalyx on the endothelial cell surface and increase endothelium permeability. Consequently, the endothelial barrier collapses, contributing to impaired microcirculatory blood flow, tissue hypoperfusion and life-threatening organ failure in the late phase of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updated epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36631716/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/36631716/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, gastrointestinal cancers represent more than one-fourth of all cancer incidence and one-third of cancer-related mortality. Although there has been much progress in screening colorectal cancer, the prognosis of other gastrointestinal cancers tends to be poor. The highest burden of gastrointestinal cancers, including stomach, liver, oesophageal and gallbladder cancers, was observed in regions in East Asia. The increasing burden of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asian regions is related to population growth, ageing and the westernization of lifestyle habits in this region. Furthermore, the rising incidence of young-onset colorectal cancer is an emerging trend in East Asia. This Review provides a comprehensive and updated summary of the epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia, with emphasis on comparing their epidemiology in East Asia with that in Western regions, and highlights the major risk factors and implications for prevention. Overall, to optimally reduce the disease burden incurred by gastrointestinal cancers in East Asian regions, a concerted effort will be needed to modify unhealthy lifestyles, promote vaccination against the hepatitis virus, control Helicobacter pylori, liver fluke and hepatitis virus infections, increase the uptake rate of colorectal cancer screening, enhance detection of early cancers and their precursors, and improve cancer survivorship through an organized rehabilitation programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a substantial burden of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia, with the highest incidence observed in colorectal and stomach cancer and the highest mortality in liver and stomach cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared with Western regions, East Asia has a higher burden of stomach, liver, oesophageal and gallbladder cancer, but the burden of colorectal and pancreatic cancer is increasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an increasing trend in young-onset colorectal, pancreatic and gallbladder cancer in East Asia attributed to the bigger increase in risk factors among the younger population.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common modifiable risk factors for gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia include smoking, alcohol intake, diet, sedentary lifestyle, obesity and metabolic diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;East Asian regions have a higher prevalence of &lt;em&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt;, liver fluke, and hepatitis B and C virus infections, hot beverage consumption and biliary cyst development, which might have increased the risk of gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key preventive strategies for gastrointestinal cancers in the East Asian population include lifestyle modifications, hepatitis vaccination, &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; infection control, cancer screening, early diagnosis and improving cancer survivorship.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Severe respiratory viral infections: T-cell functions diverging from immunity to inflammation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36635162/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/36635162/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon respiratory viral infection, a robust innate immune response can efficiently drive adaptive immunity whereby virus-specific T cells are activated. Meanwhile, memory T cells nonspecific to the virus can also be primed by proinflammatory cytokines and complement proteins, a process termed â€˜bystander activationâ€™.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exaggerated production of proinflammatory cytokines from prolonged infection can skew the balance from virus-specific T-cell activation to nonspecific bystander T-cell activation which can significantly contribute to unresolved inflammation and cause tissue damage and severe disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preventive and therapeutic strategies that suppress viral replication or inhibit proinflammatory signals can reinstate the balance of virus-specific activation and bystander activation of T cells. Prevention of T-cell-mediated pathology and tissue damage will support efficient immunity and recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A virus (IAV) trigger distinct clinical outcomes defined by immunity-based viral clearance or disease associated with exaggerated and prolonged inflammation. The important role of T cells in shaping both antiviral immunity and inflammation has revived interest in understanding the host-pathogen interactions that lead to the diverse functions of T cells in respiratory viral infections. Inborn deficiencies and acquired insufficiency in immunity can prolong infection and shift the immune response towards exacerbated inflammation, which results from persistent innate immune activation and bystander T-cell activation that is nonspecific to the pathogen but is often driven by cytokines. This review discusses how virus variants, exposure doses, routes of infection, host genetics, and immune history can modulate the activation and function of T cells, thus influencing clinical outcomes. Knowledge of virus-host interaction can inform strategies to prevent immune dysfunction in respiratory viral infection and help in the treatment of associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The oral microbiome in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of many cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and expansion of available therapies, the global burden of CVD-associated morbidity and mortality remains unacceptably high. Important gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanisms of CVD and determinants of disease progression. In the past decade, much research has been conducted on the human microbiome and its potential role in modulating CVD. With the advent of high-throughput technologies and multiomics analyses, the complex and dynamic relationship between the microbiota, their â€˜theatre of activityâ€™ and the host is gradually being elucidated. The relationship between the gut microbiome and CVD is well established. Much less is known about the role of disruption (dysbiosis) of the oral microbiome; however, interest in the field is growing, as is the body of literature from basic science and animal and human investigations. In this Review, we examine the link between the oral microbiome and CVD, specifically coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, infective endocarditis and rheumatic heart disease. We discuss the various mechanisms by which oral dysbiosis contributes to CVD pathogenesis and potential strategies for prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are increasing despite advances in our understanding of their pathophysiology and an expanded arsenal of treatment options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An association between the oral microbiome (or oralome) and cardiovascular inflammation and CVD is supported by a growing body of epidemiological studies, systematic reviews and basic science investigations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validated links exist between oral dysbiosis and CVDs, including atherosclerotic diseases, heart failure, infective endocarditis and rheumatic heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mechanisms by which oral dysbiosis contributes to CVD include immunomodulation; endothelial dysfunction; molecular mimicry and antibody cross-reactivity; protein citrullination; platelet activation, aggregation and thrombogenesis; arterial invasion; and systemic inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting oral dysbiosis in a clinical setting could be an important component of CVD management.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Inter-tissue communication of mitochondrial stress and metabolic health</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria function as a hub of the cellular metabolic network. Mitochondrial stress is closely associated with aging and a variety of diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. Cells autonomously elicit specific stress responses to cope with mitochondrial stress to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. Interestingly, mitochondrial stress responses may also be induced in a non-autonomous manner in cells or tissues that are not directly experiencing such stress. Such non-autonomous mitochondrial stress responses are mediated by secreted molecules called mitokines. Due to their significant translational potential in improving human metabolic health, there has been a surge in mitokine-focused research. In this review, we summarize the findings regarding inter-tissue communication of mitochondrial stress in animal models. In addition, we discuss the possibility of mitokine-mediated intercellular mitochondrial communication originating from bacterial quorum sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immune dysregulation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The understanding of immune dysregulation in many different diseases continues to grow. There is increasing evidence that altered microbiome and gut barrier dysfunction contribute to systemic inflammation in patients with primary immunodeficiency and in patients with rheumatic disease. Recent research provides insight into the process of induction and maturation of pathogenic age-associated B cells and highlights the role of age-associated B cells in creating tissue inflammation. T follicular regulatory cells are shown to help maintain B-cell tolerance, and therapeutic approaches to increase or promote T follicular regulatory cells may help prevent or decrease immune dysregulation. Meanwhile, novel studies of systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis reveal a strong HLA association with interstitial lung disease and identify key aspects of the pathogenesis of macrophage activation syndrome. Studies of hyperinflammatory syndromes, including the recently described multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children, characterize similarities and differences in cytokine profiles and T-cell activation. This review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of immune dysregulation and describes potential key factors that may function as biomarkers for disease or targets for therapeutic interventions. Future trials are necessary to address the many remaining questions with regards to pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of autoimmune, inflammatory, and immunodeficiency syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knowing when to stop: Transcription termination on protein-coding genes by eukaryotic RNAPII</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36634677/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene expression is controlled in a dynamic and regulated manner to allow for the consistent and steady expression of some proteins as well as the rapidly changing production of other proteins. Transcription initiation has been a major focus of study because it is highly regulated. However, termination of transcription also plays an important role in controlling gene expression. Transcription termination on protein-coding genes is intimately linked with 3&amp;rsquo; end cleavage and polyadenylation of transcripts, and it generally results in the production of a mature mRNA that is exported from the nucleus. Termination on many non-coding genes can also result in the production of a mature transcript. Termination is dynamically regulated-premature termination and transcription readthrough occur in response to a number of cellular signals, and these can have varied consequences on gene expression. Here, we review eukaryotic transcription termination by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), focusing on protein-coding genes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic fungi have emerged as significant causes of infectious morbidity and death in patients with acquired immunodeficiency conditions such as HIV/AIDS and following receipt of chemotherapy, immunosuppressive agents or targeted biologics for neoplastic or autoimmune diseases, or transplants for end organ failure. Furthermore, in recent years, the spread of multidrug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt; has caused life-threatening outbreaks in health-care facilities worldwide and raised serious concerns for global public health. Rapid progress in the discovery and functional characterization of inborn errors of immunity that predispose to fungal disease and the development of clinically relevant animal models have enhanced our understanding of fungal recognition and effector pathways and adaptive immune responses. In this Review, we synthesize our current understanding of the cellular and molecular determinants of mammalian antifungal immunity, focusing on observations that show promise for informing risk stratification, prognosis, prophylaxis and therapies to combat life-threatening fungal infections in vulnerable patient populations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gasdermins and pyroptosis in the kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36596918/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that is mediated by the membrane-targeting, pore-forming gasdermin family of proteins. Pyroptosis was initially described as a caspase 1- and inflammasome-dependent cell death pathway typified by the loss of membrane integrity and the secretion of cytokines such as IL-1Î². However, gasdermins are now recognized as the principal effectors of this form of regulated cell death; activated gasdermins insert into cell membranes, where they form pores that result in the secretion of cytokines, alarmins and damage-associated molecular patterns and cause cell membrane rupture. It is now evident that gasdermins can be activated by inflammasome- and caspase-independent mechanisms in multiple cell types and that crosstalk occurs between pyroptosis and other cell death pathways. Although they are important for host antimicrobial defence, a growing body of evidence supports the notion that pyroptosis and gasdermins have pathological roles in cancer and several non-microbial diseases involving the gut, liver and skin. The well-documented roles of inflammasome activity and apoptosis pathways in kidney diseases suggests that gasdermins and pyroptosis may also be involved to some extent. However, despite some evidence for involvement of pyroptosis in the context of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, our understanding of gasdermin biology and pyroptosis in the kidney remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hallmarks of aging: An expanding universe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging is driven by hallmarks fulfilling the following three premises: (1) their age-associated manifestation, (2) the acceleration of aging by experimentally accentuating them, and (3) the opportunity to decelerate, stop, or reverse aging by therapeutic interventions on them. We propose the following twelve hallmarks of aging: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, disabled macroautophagy, deregulated nutrient-sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, altered intercellular communication, chronic inflammation, and dysbiosis. These hallmarks are interconnected among each other, as well as to the recently proposed hallmarks of health, which include organizational features of spatial compartmentalization, maintenance of homeostasis, and adequate responses to stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long non-coding RNAs: definitions, functions, challenges and recommendations</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36596869/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/review/36596869/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genes specifying long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) occupy a large fraction of the genomes of complex organisms. The term &amp;rsquo;lncRNAs&amp;rsquo; encompasses RNA polymerase I (Pol I), Pol II and Pol III transcribed RNAs, and RNAs from processed introns. The various functions of lncRNAs and their many isoforms and interleaved relationships with other genes make lncRNA classification and annotation difficult. Most lncRNAs evolve more rapidly than protein-coding sequences, are cell type specific and regulate many aspects of cell differentiation and development and other physiological processes. Many lncRNAs associate with chromatin-modifying complexes, are transcribed from enhancers and nucleate phase separation of nuclear condensates and domains, indicating an intimate link between lncRNA expression and the spatial control of gene expression during development. lncRNAs also have important roles in the cytoplasm and beyond, including in the regulation of translation, metabolism and signalling. lncRNAs often have a modular structure and are rich in repeats, which are increasingly being shown to be relevant to their function. In this Consensus Statement, we address the definition and nomenclature of lncRNAs and their conservation, expression, phenotypic visibility, structure and functions. We also discuss research challenges and provide recommendations to advance the understanding of the roles of lncRNAs in development, cell biology and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meta-hallmarks of aging and cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both aging and cancer are characterized by a series of partially overlapping &amp;ldquo;hallmarks&amp;rdquo; that we subject here to a meta-analysis. Several hallmarks of aging (i.e., genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, chronic inflammation, and dysbiosis) are very similar to specific cancer hallmarks and hence constitute common &amp;ldquo;meta-hallmarks,&amp;rdquo; while other features of aging (i.e., telomere attrition and stem cell exhaustion) act likely to suppress oncogenesis and hence can be viewed as preponderantly &amp;ldquo;antagonistic hallmarks.&amp;rdquo; Disabled macroautophagy and cellular senescence are two hallmarks of aging that exert context-dependent oncosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic effects. Similarly, the equivalence or antagonism between aging-associated deregulated nutrient-sensing and cancer-relevant alterations of cellular metabolism is complex. The agonistic and antagonistic relationship between the processes that drive aging and cancer has bearings for the age-related increase and oldest age-related decrease of cancer morbidity and mortality, as well as for the therapeutic management of malignant disease in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of necroptosis in kidney health and disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36596919/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/36596919/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Necroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that leads to cell lysis and an inflammatory response in neighbouring tissues; dysregulation of the pathway is widely implicated in kidney diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core regulators of the necroptosis pathway are the kinases, RIPK1 and RIPK3, and the executioner pseudokinase, MLKL; each of these proteins is regulated by diverse interactions and modifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most experimental studies of necroptosis in kidney diseases have been performed in rodent models of disease; further studies are therefore essential to define the contribution of this cell death mode to human kidney diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RIPK1 inhibitors are currently being explored in clinical trials to treat neuronal and inflammatory diseases, but so far, the results have not been convincing; future trials are required to establish the viability of targeting necroptosis in kidney diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell death, particularly that of tubule epithelial cells, contributes critically to the pathophysiology of kidney disease. A body of evidence accumulated over the past 15 years has ascribed a central pathophysiological role to a particular form of regulated necrosis, termed necroptosis, to acute tubular necrosis, nephron loss and maladaptive renal fibrogenesis. Unlike apoptosis, which is a non-immunogenic process, necroptosis results in the release of cellular contents and cytokines, which triggers an inflammatory response in neighbouring tissue. This necroinflammatory environment can lead to severe organ dysfunction and cause lasting tissue injury in the kidney. Despite evidence of a link between necroptosis and various kidney diseases, there are no available therapeutic options to target this process. Greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms, triggers and regulators of necroptosis in acute and chronic kidney diseases may identify shortcomings in current approaches to therapeutically target necroptosis regulators and lead to the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolic reprogramming is involved in the pathogenesis of not only cancers but also neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. With the progress of metabonomics and proteomics, metabolites have been found to affect protein acylations through providing acyl groups or changing the activities of acyltransferases or deacylases. Reciprocally, protein acylation is involved in key cellular processes relevant to physiology and diseases, such as protein stability, protein subcellular localization, enzyme activity, transcriptional activity, protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA interactions. Herein, we summarize the functional diversity and mechanisms of eight kinds of nonhistone protein acylations in the physiological processes and progression of several diseases. We also highlight the recent progress in the development of inhibitors for acyltransferase, deacylase, and acylation reader proteins for their potential applications in drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirtuins (SIRTs) are nicotine adenine dinucleotide(+)-dependent histone deacetylases regulating critical signaling pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and are involved in numerous biological processes. Currently, seven mammalian homologs of yeast Sir2 named SIRT1 to SIRT7 have been identified. Increasing evidence has suggested the vital roles of seven members of the SIRT family in health and disease conditions. Notably, this protein family plays a variety of important roles in cellular biology such as inflammation, metabolism, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, etc., thus, it is considered a potential therapeutic target for different kinds of pathologies including cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and other conditions. Moreover, identification of SIRT modulators and exploring the functions of these different modulators have prompted increased efforts to discover new small molecules, which can modify SIRT activity. Furthermore, several randomized controlled trials have indicated that different interventions might affect the expression of SIRT protein in human samples, and supplementation of SIRT modulators might have diverse impact on physiological function in different participants. In this review, we introduce the history and structure of the SIRT protein family, discuss the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of seven members of the SIRT protein family, elaborate on the regulatory roles of SIRTs in human disease, summarize SIRT inhibitors and activators, and review related clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes are endosome-derived nanovesicles involved in cellular communication. They are natural nanocarriers secreted by various cells, making them suitable candidates for diverse drug delivery and therapeutic applications from a material standpoint. They have a phospholipid bilayer decorated with functional molecules and an enclosed parental matrix, which has attracted interest in developing designer/hybrid engineered exosome nanocarriers. The structural versatility of exosomes allows the modification of their original configuration using various methods, including genetic engineering, chemical procedures, physical techniques, and microfluidic technology, to load exosomes with additional cargo for expanded biomedical applications. Exosomes show enormous potential for overcoming the limitations of conventional nanoparticle-based techniques in targeted therapy. This review highlights the exosome sources, characteristics, state of the art in the field of hybrid exosomes, exosome-like nanovesicles and engineered exosomes as potential cargo delivery vehicles for therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multifaceted functions of STING in human health and disease: from molecular mechanism to targeted strategy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36550103/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) as an important pivot for cytosolic DNA sensation and interferon (IFN) induction, intensive efforts have been endeavored to clarify the molecular mechanism of its activation, its physiological function as a ubiquitously expressed protein, and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target in a wide range of immune-related diseases. With its orthodox ligand 2&#39;3&amp;rsquo;-cyclic GMP-AMP (2&#39;3&amp;rsquo;-cGAMP) and the upstream sensor 2&#39;3&amp;rsquo;-cGAMP synthase (cGAS) to be found, STING acquires its central functionality in the best-studied signaling cascade, namely the cGAS-STING-IFN pathway. However, recently updated research through structural research, genetic screening, and biochemical assay greatly extends the current knowledge of STING biology. A second ligand pocket was recently discovered in the transmembrane domain for a synthetic agonist. On its downstream outputs, accumulating studies sketch primordial and multifaceted roles of STING beyond its cytokine-inducing function, such as autophagy, cell death, metabolic modulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and RNA virus restriction. Furthermore, with the expansion of the STING interactome, the details of STING trafficking also get clearer. After retrospecting the brief history of viral interference and the milestone events since the discovery of STING, we present a vivid panorama of STING biology taking into account the details of the biochemical assay and structural information, especially its versatile outputs and functions beyond IFN induction. We also summarize the roles of STING in the pathogenesis of various diseases and highlight the development of small-molecular compounds targeting STING for disease treatment in combination with the latest research. Finally, we discuss the open questions imperative to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes are spherical lipid bilayer vesicles composed of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids that deliver signaling molecules through a vesicular transport system to regulate the function and morphology of target cells, thereby involving in a variety of biological processes, such as cell apoptosis or proliferation, and cytokine production. In the past decades, there are emerging evidence that exosomes play pivotal roles in the pathological mechanisms of several autoimmune diseases (ADs), including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), Sjogren&amp;rsquo;s syndrome (SS), multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). systemic sclerosis (SSc), etc. Several publications have shown that exosomes are involved in the pathogenesis of ADs mainly through intercellular communication and by influencing the response of immune cells. The level of exosomes and the expression of nucleic acids can reflect the degree of disease progression and are excellent biomarkers for ADs. In addition, exosomes have the potential to be used as drug carriers thanks to their biocompatibility and stability. In this review, we briefly summarized the current researches regarding the biological functions of exosomes in ADs, and provided an insight into the potential of exosomes as biomarkers and therapeutic delivery for these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A researcher&#39;s guide to preclinical mouse NASH models</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36539621/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its inflammatory form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), have quickly risen to become the most prevalent chronic liver disease in the Western world and are risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is not only one of the most common cancers but is also highly lethal. Nevertheless, there are currently no clinically approved drugs for NAFLD, and NASH-induced HCC poses a unique metabolic microenvironment that may influence responsiveness to certain treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the pathogenesis of this rampant disease to devise new therapies. In this line, preclinical mouse models are crucial tools to investigate mechanisms as well as novel treatment modalities during the pathogenesis of NASH and subsequent HCC in preparation for human clinical trials. Although, there are numerous genetically induced, diet-induced and toxin-induced models of NASH, not all of these models faithfully phenocopy and mirror the human pathology very well. In this Perspective, we shed some light onto the most widely used mouse models of NASH and highlight some of the key advantages and disadvantages of the various models with an emphasis on &amp;lsquo;Western diets&amp;rsquo;, which are increasingly recognized as some of the best models in recapitulating the human NASH pathology and comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging roles of mechanosensitive ion channels in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36539808/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a devastating respiratory disorder with high rates of mortality and morbidity, but the detailed underlying mechanisms of ALI/ARDS remain largely unknown. Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), including epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Piezo channels, transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), and two-pore domain potassium ion (K2P) channels, are highly expressed in lung tissues, and the activity of these MSCs can be modulated by mechanical forces (e.g., mechanical ventilation) and other stimuli (e.g., LPS, hyperoxia). Dysfunction of MSCs has been found in various types of ALI/ARDS, and MSCs play a key role in regulating alveolar fluid clearance, alveolar epithelial/endothelial barrier function, the inflammatory response and surfactant secretion in ALI/ARDS lungs. Targeting MSCs exerts therapeutic effects in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. In this review, we summarize the structure and functions of several well-recognized MSCs, the role of MSCs in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and recent advances in the pharmacological and molecular modulation of MSCs in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. According to the current literature, targeting MSCs might be a very promising therapeutic approach against ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NMNAT2 is an evolutionarily conserved NAD+ synthase located in the cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NMNAT2 plays an axonal protective role in neurodegenerative diseases by the NMNAT2-NAD+-SARM1 signal axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NMNAT2 promotes the occurrence and development of solid tumors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NMNAT2 is an important molecular target affecting disease treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) is an evolutionarily conserved nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) synthase located in the cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus. NMNAT2 has an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, malignant tumors, and other diseases that seriously endanger human health. NMNAT2 exerts a neuroprotective function through its NAD synthase activity and chaperone function. Among them, the NMNAT2-NAD+-Sterile alpha and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor motif-containing 1 (SARM1) axis is closely related to Wallerian degeneration. Physical injury or pathological stimulation will cause a decrease in NMNAT2, which activates SARM1, leading to axonal degeneration and the occurrence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease, peripheral neuropathy, and other neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, NMNAT2 exerts a cancer-promoting role in solid tumors, including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and glioma, and is closely related to tumor occurrence and development. This paper reviews the chromosomal and subcellular localization of NMNAT2 and its basic biological functions. We also summarize the NMNAT2-related signal transduction pathway and the role of NMNAT2 in diseases. We aimed to provide a new perspective to comprehensively understand the relationship between NMNAT2 and its associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Small extracellular vesicles in metabolic remodeling of tumor cells: Cargos and translational application</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36588730/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warburg effect is characterized by excessive consumption of glucose by the tumor cells under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions. This metabolic reprogramming allows the tumor cells to adapt to the unique microenvironment and proliferate rapidly, and also promotes tumor metastasis and therapy resistance. Metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells is driven by the aberrant expression and activity of metabolic enzymes, which results in the accumulation of oncometabolites, and the hyperactivation of intracellular growth signals. Recent studies suggest that tumor-associated metabolic remodeling also depends on intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), also known as exosomes, are smaller than 200 nm in diameter and are formed by the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. The sEVs are instrumental in transporting cargoes such as proteins, nucleic acids or metabolites between the tumor, stromal and immune cells of the TME, and are thus involved in reprogramming the glucose metabolism of recipient cells. In this review, we have summarized the biogenesis and functions of sEVs and metabolic cargos, and the mechanisms through they drive the Warburg effect. Furthermore, the potential applications of targeting sEV-mediated metabolic pathways in tumor liquid biopsy, imaging diagnosis and drug development have also been discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that bile acids play important roles in lipid metabolism. In recent decades, bile acids have also been shown to function as signaling molecules via interacting with various receptors. Bile acids circulate continuously through the enterohepatic circulation and go through microbial transformation by gut microbes, and thus bile acids metabolism has profound effects on the liver and intestinal tissues as well as the gut microbiota. Farnesoid X receptor and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 are two pivotal bile acid receptors that highly expressed in the intestinal tissues, and they have emerged as pivotal regulators in bile acids metabolism, innate immunity and inflammatory responses. There is considerable interest in manipulating the metabolism of bile acids and the expression of bile acid receptors as this may be a promising strategy to regulate intestinal health and disease. This review aims to summarize the roles of bile acids and their receptors in regulation of gut health and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, elucidation of the genetic defects that underlie cancer has resulted in a plethora of novel targeted cancer drugs. Although these agents can initially be highly effective, resistance to single-agent therapies remains a major challenge. Combining drugs can help avoid resistance, but the number of possible drug combinations vastly exceeds what can be tested clinically, both financially and in terms of patient availability. Rational drug combinations based on a deep understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with therapy resistance are potentially powerful in the treatment of cancer. Here, we discuss the mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies and how effective drug combinations can be identified to combat resistance. The challenges in clinically developing these combinations and future perspectives are considered.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has emerged as a critical innate immune pathway that, following engagement by DNA, promotes distinct immune effector responses that can impact virtually all aspects of tumorigenesis, from malignant cell transformation to metastasis. Here we address how natural tumor-associated processes and traditional cancer therapies are shaped by cGAS-STING signaling, and how this contributes to beneficial or detrimental outcomes of cancer. We consider current efforts to target the cGAS-STING axis in tumors and highlight new frontiers in cGAS-STING biology to inspire thinking about their connection to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung epithelial organoids for the hazard assessment of inhaled nanomaterials offer a promising improvement to in vitro culture systems used so far. Organoids grow in three-dimensional (3D) spheres and can be derived from either induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or primary lung tissue stem cells from either human or mouse. In this perspective we will highlight advantages and disadvantages of traditional culture systems frequently used for testing nanomaterials and compare them to lung epithelial organoids. We also discuss the differences between tissue and iPSC-derived organoids and give an outlook in which direction the whole field could possibly go with these versatile tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reprogramming transcription after DNA damage: recognition, response, repair, and restart</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36513571/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent advances in elucidating the role of transcription in DNA damage repair reveal that it has both beneficial and adverse effects on genome stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNA lesion-stalled RNA polymerase (Pol) II triggers the transcription-coupled DNA repair pathway, which involves multiple regulatory factors acting in a concerted and sequential manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transcription is rapidly shut down by DNA damage response (DDR) master regulators, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), using mechanisms that include the direct inhibition of Pol II elongation and the establishment of repressive chromatin environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the damaged DNA is repaired, multiple mechanisms exist to ensure proper and timely restoration of transcription. The inhibition of this process undermines genomic integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome integrity is constantly challenged by endogenous and exogenous insults that cause DNA damage. To cope with these threats, cells have a surveillance mechanism, known as the DNA damage response (DDR), to repair any lesions. Although transcription has long been implicated in DNA repair, how transcriptional reprogramming is coordinated with the DDR is just beginning to be understood. In this review, we highlight recent advances in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying major transcriptional events, including RNA polymerase (Pol) II stalling and transcriptional silencing and recovery, which occur in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, we discuss how such transcriptional adaptation contributes to sensing and eliminating damaged DNA and how it can jeopardize genome integrity when it goes awry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosomal noncoding RNAs in central nervous system diseases: biological functions and potential clinical applications</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36438184/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central nervous system (CNS) disease is a general term for a series of complex and diverse diseases, including Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), CNS tumors, stroke, epilepsy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Interneuron and neuron-glia cells communicate with each other through their homeostatic microenvironment. Exosomes in the microenvironment have crucial impacts on interneuron and neuron-glia cells by transferring their contents, such as proteins, lipids, and ncRNAs, constituting a novel form of cell-to-cell interaction and communication. Exosomal noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), regulate physiological functions and maintain CNS homeostasis. Exosomes are regarded as extracellular messengers that transfer ncRNAs between neurons and body fluids due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of exosomal ncRNAs in CNS diseases, including prospective diagnostic biomarkers, pathological regulators, therapeutic strategies and clinical applications. We also provide an all-sided discussion of the comparison with some similar CNS diseases and the main limitations and challenges for exosomal ncRNAs in clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR-based technologies represent a major breakthrough in biomedical science as they offer a powerful platform for unbiased screening and functional genomics in various fields, including immunology. Pooled and arrayed CRISPR screens have uncovered previously unknown intracellular drivers in innate and adaptive immune cells for immune regulation as well as intercellular regulators mediating cell-cell interactions. Recent single-cell CRISPR screening platforms expand the readouts to the transcriptome and enable the inference of gene regulatory networks for better mechanistic insights. CRISPR screens also allow for mapping of genetic interactions to identify genes that synergize or alleviate complex immune phenotypes. Here, we review the progress in and emerging adaptation of CRISPR technologies to advance our fundamental immunological knowledge and identify novel disease targets for immunotherapy of infection, inflammation and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-cell atlases promise to provide a &amp;lsquo;missing link&amp;rsquo; between genes, diseases and therapies. By identifying the specific cell types, states, programs and contexts where disease-implicated genes act, we will understand the mechanisms of disease at the cellular and tissue levels and can use this understanding to develop powerful disease diagnostics; identify promising new drug targets; predict their efficacy, toxicity and resistance mechanisms; and empower new kinds of therapies, from cancer therapies to regenerative medicine. Here, we lay out a vision for the potential of cell atlases to impact the future of medicine, and describe how advances over the past decade have begun to realize this potential in common complex diseases, infectious diseases (including COVID-19), rare diseases and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Common mechanisms in pediatric acute liver failure</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36496278/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/36496278/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;n 2022 an epidemic of acute hepatitis causing ALF, which affected children aged &amp;lt;5 years, has drawn attention to the lack of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of ALF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most children with ALF during this epidemic were positive for human adenovirus and adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), neither of which is typically linked to ALF in immunocompetent children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children with mutations in genes that form part of the ISR (e.g., PERK) can develop ALF in response to non-hepatotropic viruses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activity in the innate immune system is potentiated by factors derived from the intestinal microbiome and is dependent on Myc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulation of p53 activity is important for determining the balance of hepatocyte senescence and therefore the ability to regenerate during ALF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but potentially fatal disease in children. The etiology is multifactorial, including infection, autoimmune, and genetic disorders, as well as indeterminate hepatitis, which has a higher requirement for liver transplantation. Activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems leads to hepatocyte-specific injury which is mitigated by T regulatory cell activation. Recovery of the native liver depends on activation of apoptotic and regenerative pathways, including the integrated stress response (ISR; e.g., PERK), p53, and HNF4Î±. Loss-of-function mutations in these pathways cause recurrent ALF in response to non-hepatotropic viruses. Deeper understanding of these mechanisms will lead to improved diagnosis, management, and outcomes for pediatric ALF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When ferroptosis meets pathogenic infections</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36496309/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/36496309/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pathogens regulate ferroptosis to promote their replication, dissemination, pathogenesis, or evade host immune responses, which benefits the survival of pathogens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pathogens interact with the classic antioxidant system, the GPX4-dependent pathway, to disturb intracellular lipid ROS elimination, to manipulate ferroptosis execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pathogens commandeer lipid ROS by adjusting iron, lipid, and mitochondria metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulation of pathogen-associated ferroptosis is a promising therapeutic strategy against infectious diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy are diverse types of regulated cell death (RCD), recognized as the strategies that host cells use to defend against pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Pathogens can induce or block different types of host cell RCD, promoting propagation or evading host immune surveillance. Ferroptosis is a newly identified RCD. Evidence has demonstrated how pathogens regulate ferroptosis to promote their replication, dissemination, and pathogenesis. However, the interaction between ferroptosis and pathogenic infections still needs to be completely elucidated. This review summarizes the advances in the interaction between pathogenic infections and host ferroptotic processes, focusing on the underlying mechanisms of how pathogens exploit ferroptosis, and discussing possible therapeutic measures against pathogen-associated diseases in a ferroptosis-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarcoma is a group of rare and heterogeneous mesenchymal tumors, prone to late diagnosis and poor prognosis. Exosomes are cell-derived small extracellular vesicles found in most body fluids and contain nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and other molecules. Qualitative and quantitative changes of exosomes and the contents are associated with sarcoma progression, exhibiting their potential as biomarkers. Exosomes possess the capacity of evading immune responses, bioactivity for trafficking, tumor tropism, and lesion residence. Thus, exosomes could be engineered as tumor-specific vehicles in drugs and RNA delivery systems. Exosomes might also serve as therapeutic targets in targeted therapy and immunotherapy and be involved in chemotherapy resistance. Here, we provide a comprehensive summary of exosome applications in liquid biopsy-based diagnosis and explore their implications in the delivery system, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy resistance of sarcoma. Moreover, challenges in exosome clinical applications are raised and some future research directions are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis has emerged as a promising target for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. Although disrupting glutathione metabolism is the primary strategy for ferroptosis induction, additional key pathways link ferroptosis to CRC pathogenesis. Here, we discuss arachidonic acid (AA), energy metabolism, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and Hippo signaling, summarize key findings, and propose new conceptual avenues for CRC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical translation of messenger mRNA (mRNA)-based therapeutics requires safe and effective delivery systems. Although considerable progress has been made on the development of mRNA delivery systems, many challenges, such as the dose-limiting toxicity and specific delivery to extrahepatic tissues, still remain. Cell-derived vesicles, a type of endogenous membranous particle secreted from living cells, can be leveraged to load mRNA during or after their biogenesis. Currently, they have received increasing interest for mRNA delivery due to their natural origin, good biocompatibility, cell-specific tropism, and unique ability to cross physiological barriers. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in the naturally occurring mRNA delivery platforms and their biomedical applications. Furthermore, the future perspectives on clinical translation of cell-derived vesicles have been discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted immunotherapy has improved patient survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but less than 20% of patients produce a durable response to these treatments. Thus, new immunotherapies that consider all key players of the complex HNSCC tumour microenvironment (TME) are necessary to further enhance tumour-specific T cell responses in patients. HNSCC is an ideal tumour type in which to evaluate immune and non-immune cell differences because of two distinct TME aetiologies (human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative disease), multiple anatomic sites for tumour growth, and clear distinctions between patients with locally advanced disease and those with recurrent and/or metastatic disease. Recent technological and scientific advancements have provided a more complete picture of all cellular constituents within this complex TME and have evaluated the interplay of both immune and non-immune cells within HNSCC. Here, we include a comprehensive analysis of the complete ecosystem of the HNSCC TME, performed utilizing data-rich resources such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, and cutting-edge techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, high-dimensional flow cytometry and spatial multispectral imaging, to generate improved treatment strategies for this diverse disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common severe complications among hospitalized patients. In the absence of specific drugs to treat AKI, hemodialysis remains the primary clinical treatment for AKI patients. AKI treatment has received significant attention recently due to the excellent drug delivery capabilities of low-dimensional nanomaterials (LDNs) and their unique therapeutic effects. Diverse LDNs have been proposed to treat AKI, with promising results and the potential for future clinical application. This article aims to provide an overview of the pathogenesis of AKI and the recent advances in the treatment of AKI using different types of LDNs. In addition, it is intended to provide theoretical support for the design of LDNs and implications for AKI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has wrought havoc on the world economy and people&amp;rsquo;s daily lives. The inability to comprehensively control COVID-19 is due to the difficulty of early and timely diagnosis, the lack of effective therapeutic drugs, and the limited effectiveness of vaccines. The body contains billions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have shown remarkable potential in disease diagnosis, drug development, and vaccine carriers. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that EVs may participate or assist the body in defence, antagonism, recovery and acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2. On the one hand, intercepting and decrypting the general intelligence carried in circulating EVs from COVID-19 patients will provide an important hint for diagnosis and treatment; on the other hand, engineered EVs modified by gene editing in the laboratory will amplify the effectiveness of inhibiting infection, replication and destruction of ever-mutating SARS-CoV-2, facilitating tissue repair and making a better vaccine. To comprehensively understand the interaction between EVs and SARS-CoV-2, providing new insights to overcome some difficulties in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19, we conducted a rounded review in this area. We also explain numerous critical challenges that these tactics face before they enter the clinic, and this work will provide previous &amp;lsquo;meet change with constancy&amp;rsquo; lessons for responding to future similar public health disasters. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide a &amp;lsquo;meet changes with constancy&amp;rsquo; strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2 that spans defence, antagonism, recovery, and acquired immunity. Targets for COVID-19 diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of progression may be found by capture of the message decoding in circulating EVs. Engineered and biomimetic EVs can boost effects of the natural EVs, especially anti-SARS-CoV-2, targeted repair of damaged tissue, and improvement of vaccine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular signals regulate the biogenesis of extracellular vesicles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are naturally released membrane vesicles that act as carriers of proteins and RNAs for intercellular communication. With various biomolecules and specific ligands, EV has represented a novel form of information transfer, which possesses extremely outstanding efficiency and specificity compared to the classical signal transduction. In addition, EV has extended the concept of signal transduction to intercellular aspect by working as the collection of extracellular information. Therefore, the functions of EVs have been extensively characterized and EVs exhibit an exciting prospect for clinical applications. However, the biogenesis of EVs and, in particular, the regulation of this process by extracellular signals, which are essential to conduct further studies and support optimal utility, remain unclear. Here, we review the current understanding of the biogenesis of EVs, focus on the regulation of this process by extracellular signals and discuss their therapeutic value.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cellular functions of cGAS-STING signaling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36437149/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) senses misplaced genomic, mitochondrial, and microbial double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to synthesize 2&#39;3&amp;rsquo;-cGAMP that mobilizes stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to unleash innate immune responses, constituting a ubiquitous and effective surveillance system against tissue damage and pathogen invasion. However, imbalanced cGAS-STING signaling tethers considerably in infectious, autoimmune, malignant, fibrotic, and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, multifaceted roles for cGAS-STING signaling at the cellular scale have emerged; these include autophagy, translation, metabolism homeostasis, cellular condensation, DNA damage repair, senescence, and cell death. These dominances adaptively shape cellular physiologies and impact disease pathogenesis. However, understanding how DNA sensing-initiated responses trigger these diverse cellular processes remains an outstanding challenge. In this review we discuss recent developments of cellular physiological states controlled by cGAS-STING machinery, as well as their disease relevance and underlying mechanisms, canonical or noncanonical. Ultimately, exploiting these cellular functions and mechanisms may represent promising targets for disease therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Endothelial progenitor cells in the host defense response</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36436689/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive injury of endothelial cells in blood vasculature, especially in the microcirculatory system, frequently occurs in hosts suffering from sepsis and the accompanied systemic inflammation. Pathological factors, including toxic components derived from invading microbes, oxidative stress associated with tissue ischemia/reperfusion, and vessel active mediators generated during the inflammatory response, are known to play important roles in mediating endothelial injury. Collapse of microcirculation and tissue edema developed from the failure of endothelial barrier function in vital organ systems, including the lung, brain, and kidney, are detrimental, which often predict fatal outcomes. The host body possesses a substantial capacity for maintaining vascular homeostasis and repairing endothelial damage. Bone marrow and vascular wall niches house endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). In response to septic challenges, EPCs in their niche environment are rapidly activated for proliferation and angiogenic differentiation. In the meantime, release of EPCs from their niches into the blood stream and homing of these vascular precursors to tissue sites of injury are markedly increased. The recruited EPCs actively participate in host defense against endothelial injury and repair of damage in blood vasculature via direct differentiation into endothelial cells for re-endothelialization as well as production of vessel active mediators to exert paracrine and autocrine effects on angiogenesis/vasculogenesis. In recent years, investigations on significance of EPCs in host defense and molecular signaling mechanisms underlying regulation of the EPC response have achieved substantial progress, which promotes exploration of vascular precursor cell-based approaches for effective prevention and treatment of sepsis-induced vascular injury as well as vital organ system failure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The emerging era of cell engineering: Harnessing the modularity of cells to program complex biological function</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36423287/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new era of biological engineering is emerging in which living cells are used as building blocks to address therapeutic challenges. These efforts are distinct from traditional molecular engineering-their focus is not on optimizing individual genes and proteins as therapeutics, but rather on using molecular components as modules to reprogram how cells make decisions and communicate to achieve higher-order physiological functions in vivo. This cell-centric approach is enabled by a growing tool kit of components that can synthetically control core cell-level functional outputs, such as where in the body a cell should go, what other cells it should interact with, and what messages it should transmit or receive. The power of cell engineering has been clinically validated by the development of immune cells designed to kill cancer. This same tool kit for rewiring cell connectivity is beginning to be used to engineer cell therapies for a host of other diseases and to program the self-organization of tissues and organs. By forcing the conceptual distillation of complex biological functions into a finite set of instructions that operate at the cell level, these efforts also shed light on the fundamental hierarchical logic that links molecular components to higher-order physiological function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Copper homeostasis and cuproptosis in health and disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36414625/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an essential micronutrient, copper is required for a wide range of physiological processes in virtually all cell types. Because the accumulation of intracellular copper can induce oxidative stress and perturbing cellular function, copper homeostasis is tightly regulated. Recent studies identified a novel copper-dependent form of cell death called cuproptosis, which is distinct from all other known pathways underlying cell death. Cuproptosis occurs via copper binding to lipoylated enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which leads to subsequent protein aggregation, proteotoxic stress, and ultimately cell death. Here, we summarize our current knowledge regarding copper metabolism, copper-related disease, the characteristics of cuproptosis, and the mechanisms that regulate cuproptosis. In addition, we discuss the implications of cuproptosis in the pathogenesis of various disease conditions, including Wilson&amp;rsquo;s disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, and we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting cuproptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Non-Coding RNAs of Extracellular Vesicles: Key Players in Organ-Specific Metastasis and Clinical Implications</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36428785/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous membrane-encapsulated vesicles released by most cells. They act as multifunctional regulators of intercellular communication by delivering bioactive molecules, including non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Metastasis is a major cause of cancer-related death. Most cancer cells disseminate and colonize a specific target organ via EVs, a process known as &amp;ldquo;organ-specific metastasis&amp;rdquo;. Mounting evidence has shown that EVs are enriched with ncRNAs, and various EV-ncRNAs derived from tumor cells influence organ-specific metastasis via different mechanisms. Due to the tissue-specific expression of EV-ncRNAs, they could be used as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of tumor metastasis in various types of cancer. In this review, we have discussed the underlying mechanisms of EV-delivered ncRNAs in the most common organ-specific metastases of liver, bone, lung, brain, and lymph nodes. Moreover, we summarize the potential clinical applications of EV-ncRNAs in organ-specific metastasis to fill the gap between benches and bedsides.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A brief guideline for studies of phase-separated biomolecular condensates</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36400991/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells are exquisitely compartmentalized to achieve precise spatiotemporal regulation of myriad processes and pathways. Phase separation offers one way to achieve territorial organization in the cellular context, via the creation of membrane-less organelles (MLOs). MLOs formed through phase separation are associated with numerous critical biological functions. Although hundreds of publications on related topics are produced each year, robust criteria for the determination of biologically meaningful phase separation are yet to be well established. Here we present some principles and propose a few guidelines for phase-separation studies in biology. Specifically, we provide an in-depth experiment pipeline for phase-separation studies, including mechanisms of the molecular driving forces, ways to correlate in vivo and in vitro observations, and strategies to relate the phase-separation phenomenon to biological functions. We also intend to contribute to streamlining the aforementioned diagnostic criteria by further stressing a few common caveats in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Do Extracellular Vesicles Play a Key Role in the Maintenance of Bone Homeostasis and Regeneration? A Comprehensive Review of Literature</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36419718/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maintenance of bone homeostasis includes both bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. These two processes are in dynamic balance to maintain a constant amount of bone for accomplishing its critical functions in daily life. Multiple cell type communications are involved in these two complex and continuous processes. In recent decades, an increasing number of studies have shown that osteogenic and osteoclastic extracellular vesicles play crucial roles in regulating bone homeostasis through paracrine, autosecretory and endocrine signaling. Elucidating the functional roles of extracellular vesicles in the maintenance of bone homeostasis may contribute to the design of new strategies for bone regeneration. Hence, we review the recent understandings of the classification, production process, extraction methods, structure, contents, functions and applications of extracellular vesicles in bone homeostasis. We highlight the contents of various bone-derived extracellular vesicles and their interactions with different cells in the bone microenvironment during bone homeostasis. We also summarize the recent advances in EV-loaded biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The emerging field of oncolytic virus-based cancer immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36402738/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/36402738/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural or genetically modified oncolytic viruses (OVs) are promising antitumor agents for specifically targeting tumor cells without harming normal cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OV-based oncolysis and OV-induced antiviral immune responses play an important role in remodeling the tumor microenvironment (TME) from immunologically &amp;lsquo;cold&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;hot&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As single agents or combined with other strategies, OVs can enhance cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OV persistence, replication, spread, systemic delivery, lack of therapeutic biomarkers, and moderate efficacy as single agents are among the main challenges in the field. If these problems can be solved, OV will most likely substantially enhance clinical outcomes for cancer patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oncolytic viruses (OVs) provide novel and promising therapeutic options for patients with cancers resistant to traditional therapies. Natural or genetically modified OVs are multifaceted tumor killers. They directly lyse tumor cells while sparing normal cells, and indirectly potentiate antitumor immunity by releasing antigens and activating inflammatory responses in the tumor microenvironment. However, some limitations, such as limited penetration of OVs into tumors, short persistence, and the host antiviral immune response, are impeding the broad translation of oncolytic virotherapy into the clinic. If these challenges can be overcome, combination therapies, such as OVs plus immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, or CAR natural killer (NK) cells, may provide powerful therapeutic platforms in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a central cytokine in inflammatory reactions, and biologics that neutralize TNF are among the most successful drugs for the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies. In recent years, it became clear that TNF drives inflammatory responses not only directly by inducing inflammatory gene expression but also indirectly by inducing cell death, instigating inflammatory immune reactions and disease development. Hence, inhibitors of cell death are being considered as a new therapy for TNF-dependent inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TGFÎ² control of immune responses in cancer: a holistic immuno-oncology perspective</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36380023/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immune system responds to cancer in two main ways. First, there are prewired responses involving myeloid cells, innate lymphocytes and innate-like adaptive lymphocytes that either reside in premalignant tissues or migrate directly to tumours, and second, there are antigen priming-dependent responses, in which adaptive lymphocytes are primed in secondary lymphoid organs before homing to tumours. Transforming growth factor-Î² (TGFÎ²) - one of the most potent and pleiotropic regulatory cytokines - controls almost every stage of the tumour-elicited immune response, from leukocyte development in primary lymphoid organs to their priming in secondary lymphoid organs and their effector functions in the tumour itself. The complexity of TGFÎ²-regulated immune cell circuitries, as well as the contextual roles of TGFÎ² signalling in cancer cells and tumour stromal cells, necessitates the use of rigorous experimental systems that closely recapitulate human cancer, such as autochthonous tumour models, to uncover the underlying immunobiology. The diverse functions of TGFÎ² in healthy tissues further complicate the search for effective and safe cancer therapeutics targeting the TGFÎ² pathway. Here we discuss the contextual complexity of TGFÎ² signalling in tumour-elicited immune responses and explain how understanding this may guide the development of mechanism-based cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have increasingly been recognized as important cell surrogates influencing many pathophysiological processes, including cellular homeostasis, cancer progression, neurologic disease, and infectious disease. These behaviors enable EVs broad application prospects for clinical application in disease diagnosis and treatment. Many studies suggest that EVs are superior to conventional synthetic carriers in terms of drug delivery and circulating biomarkers for early disease diagnosis, opening up new frontiers for modern theranostics. Despite these clinical potential, EVs containing diverse cellular components, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites are highly heterogeneous and small size. The limitation of preparatory, engineering and analytical technologies for EVs poses technical barriers to clinical translation. This article aims at present a critical overview of emerging technologies in EVs field for biomedical applications and challenges involved in their clinic translations. The current methods for isolation and identification of EVs are discussed. Additionally, engineering strategies developed to enhance scalable production and improved cargo loading as well as tumor targeting are presented. The superior clinical potential of EVs, particularly in terms of different cell origins and their application in the next generation of diagnostic and treatment platforms, are clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes are a subgroup of nanosized extracellular vesicles enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane and secreted by most eukaryotic cells. They represent a route of intercellular communication and participate in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes. The biological roles of exosomes rely on their bioactive cargos, including proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which are delivered to target cells. Their distinctive propertiesâ”€innate stability, low immunogenicity, biocompatibility, and good biomembrane penetration capacityâ”€allow them to function as superior natural nanocarriers for efficient drug delivery. Another notably favorable clinical application of exosomes is in diagnostics. They hold various biomolecules from host cells, which are indicative of pathophysiological conditions; therefore, they are considered vital for biomarker discovery in clinical diagnostics. Here, we use data from the CAS Content Collection and provide a landscape overview of the current state and delineate trends in research advancement on exosome applications in therapeutics and diagnostics across time, geography, composition, cargo loading, and development pipelines. We discuss exosome composition and pathway, from their biogenesis and secretion from host cells to recipient cell uptake. We assess methods for exosome isolation and purification, their clinical applications in therapy and diagnostics, their development pipelines, the exploration goals of the companies, the assortment of diseases they aim to treat, development stages of their research, and publication trends. We hope this review will be useful for understanding the current knowledge in the field of medical applications of exosomes, in an effort to further solve the remaining challenges in fulfilling their potential.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNAs as emerging regulators in COVID-19 pathogenesis and progression</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36439162/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious acute respiratory disease caused by a newly emerging RNA virus, is a still-growing pandemic that has caused more than 6 million deaths globally and has seriously threatened the lives and health of people across the world. Currently, several drugs have been used in the clinical treatment of COVID-19, such as small molecules, neutralizing antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies. In addition, several vaccines have been used to prevent the spread of the pandemic, such as adenovirus vector vaccines, inactivated vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. However, the efficacy of vaccines and the onset of adverse reactions vary among individuals. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are crucial regulators of viral infections and antiviral immune responses and are heavily involved in COVID-19 pathologies. During novel coronavirus infection, circRNAs not only directly affect the transcription process and interfere with viral replication but also indirectly regulate biological processes, including virus-host receptor binding and the immune response. Consequently, understanding the expression and function of circRNAs during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will provide novel insights into the development of circRNA-based methods. In this review, we summarize recent progress on the roles and underlying mechanisms of circRNAs that regulate the inflammatory response, viral replication, immune evasion, and cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thus highlighting the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in the treatment of COVID-19 and future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human lung cellular portfolio, traditionally characterized by cellular morphology and individual markers, is highly diverse, with over 40 cell types and a complex branching structure highly adapted for agile airflow and gas exchange. While constant during adulthood, lung cellular content changes in response to exposure, injury, and infection. Some changes are temporary, but others are persistent, leading to structural changes and progressive lung disease. The recent advance of single-cell profiling technologies allows an unprecedented level of detail and scale to cellular measurements, leading to the rise of comprehensive cell atlas styles of reporting. In this review, we chronical the rise of cell atlases and explore their contributions to human lung biology in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organ Crosstalk in Acute Kidney Injury: Evidence and Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36431113/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is becoming a public health problem worldwide. AKI is usually considered a complication of lung, heart, liver, gut, and brain disease, but recent findings have supported that injured kidney can also cause dysfunction of other organs, suggesting organ crosstalk existence in AKI. However, the organ crosstalk in AKI and the underlying mechanisms have not been broadly reviewed or fully investigated. In this review, we summarize recent clinical and laboratory findings of organ crosstalk in AKI and highlight the related molecular mechanisms. Moreover, their crosstalk involves inflammatory and immune responses, hemodynamic change, fluid homeostasis, hormone secretion, nerve reflex regulation, uremic toxin, and oxidative stress. Our review provides important clues for the intervention for AKI and investigates important therapeutic potential from a new perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The microbiota and the gut-liver axis in primary sclerosing cholangitis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36352157/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) offers unique opportunities to explore the gut-liver axis owing to the close association between liver disease and colonic inflammation. It is well established that the gut microbiota in people with PSC differs from that of healthy individuals, but details of the microbial factors that demarcate PSC from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) without PSC are poorly understood. In this Review, we aim to provide an overview of the latest literature on the gut microbiome in PSC and PSC with IBD, critically examining hypotheses on how microorganisms could contribute to the pathogenesis of PSC. A particular emphasis will be put on pathogenic features of the gut microbiota that might explain the occurrence of bile duct inflammation and liver disease in the context of IBD, and we postulate the potential existence of a specific yet unknown factor related to the gut-liver axis as causative in PSC. Available data are scrutinized in the perspective of therapeutic approaches related to the gut-liver axis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The NLRP3 inflammasome: regulation by metabolic signalss</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36371361/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/review/36371361/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glycolytic enzymes differentially regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Itaconate post-translationally modifies kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), NLRP3, and gasdermin D (GSDMD) proteins to dampen both the NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Succination of GSDMD and GSDME blocks pyroptosis and apoptosis, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation regulate the priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several metabolic pathways are instrumental in modulating myeloid cell responses to inflammation and new findings are revealing further molecular details regarding inflammasome regulation. By targeting various proteins, itaconate â€“ a metabolite derived from the TCA cycle â€“ is gaining significant attention because it can dampen the NLRP3 inflammasome and lower pyroptotic cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophages undergo profound metabolic reprogramming upon sensing infectious and sterile stimuli. This metabolic shift supports and regulates essential innate immune functions, including activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Within distinct metabolic networks, key enzymes play pivotal roles to control flux restraining detrimental inflammasome signaling. However, depending on the metabolic cues, specific enzymes and metabolites result in inflammasome activation outcomes which contrast other metabolic steps in the pathway. We posit that understanding which metabolic steps commit to discrete inflammasome fates will broaden our understanding of metabolic checkpoints to maintain homeostasis and offer better therapeutic options in human disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The intestinal barrier in disorders of the central nervous system</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36334596/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intestinal barrier, which primarily consists of a mucus layer, an epithelial barrier, and a gut vascular barrier, has a crucial role in health and disease by facilitating nutrient absorption and preventing the entry of pathogens. The intestinal barrier is in close contact with gut microbiota on its luminal side and with enteric neurons and glial cells on its tissue side. Mounting evidence now suggests that the intestinal barrier is compromised not only in digestive disorders, but also in disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), such as Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease, autism spectrum disorder, depression, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease. After providing an overview of the structure and functions of the intestinal barrier, we review existing preclinical and clinical studies supporting the notion that intestinal barrier dysfunction is present in neurological, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. On the basis of this evidence, we discuss the mechanisms that possibly link gut barrier dysfunction and CNS disorders and the potential impact that evaluating enteric barriers in brain disorders could have on clinical practice, in terms of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exosome biogenesis: machinery, regulation, and therapeutic implications in cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36320056/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes are well-known key mediators of intercellular communication and contribute to various physiological and pathological processes. Their biogenesis involves four key steps, including cargo sorting, MVB formation and maturation, transport of MVBs, and MVB fusion with the plasma membrane. Each process is modulated through the competition or coordination of multiple mechanisms, whereby diverse repertoires of molecular cargos are sorted into distinct subpopulations of exosomes, resulting in the high heterogeneity of exosomes. Intriguingly, cancer cells exploit various strategies, such as aberrant gene expression, posttranslational modifications, and altered signaling pathways, to regulate the biogenesis, composition, and eventually functions of exosomes to promote cancer progression. Therefore, exosome biogenesis-targeted therapy is being actively explored. In this review, we systematically summarize recent progress in understanding the machinery of exosome biogenesis and how it is regulated in the context of cancer. In particular, we highlight pharmacological targeting of exosome biogenesis as a promising cancer therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracellular vesicles in the pathogenesis and treatment of acute lung injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are common life-threatening lung diseases associated with acute and severe inflammation. Both have high mortality rates, and despite decades of research on clinical ALI/ARDS, there are no effective therapeutic strategies. Disruption of alveolar-capillary barrier integrity or activation of inflammatory responses leads to lung inflammation and injury. Recently, studies on the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in regulating normal and pathophysiologic cell activities, including inflammation and injury responses, have attracted attention. Injured and dysfunctional cells often secrete EVs into serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with altered cargoes, which can be used to diagnose and predict the development of ALI/ARDS. EVs secreted by mesenchymal stem cells can also attenuate inflammatory reactions associated with cell dysfunction and injury to preserve or restore cell function, and thereby promote cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. This review focuses on the roles of EVs in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation, particularly ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PANoptosis: A Unique Innate Immune Inflammatory Cell Death Modality</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36253067/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate immunity is the first response to protect against pathogens and cellular insults. Pattern recognition receptors sense pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns and induce an innate immune response characterized by inflammation and programmed cell death (PCD). In-depth characterization of innate immune PCD pathways has highlighted significant cross-talk. Recent advances led to the identification of a unique inflammatory PCD modality called PANoptosis, which is regulated by multifaceted PANoptosome complexes that are assembled by integrating components from other PCD pathways. The totality of biological effects observed in PANoptosis cannot be accounted for by any other PCD pathway alone. In this review, we briefly describe mechanisms of innate immune cell death, including molecular mechanisms of PANoptosis activation and regulation. We also highlight the PANoptosomes identified to date and provide an overview of the implications of PANoptosis in disease and therapeutic targeting. Improved understanding of innate immune-mediated cell death, PANoptosis, is critical to inform the next generation of treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ROS-triggered endothelial cell death mechanisms: Focus on pyroptosis, parthanatos, and ferroptosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endothelium is a single layer of epithelium covering the surface of the vascular system, and it represents a physical barrier between the blood and vessel wall that plays an important role in maintaining intravascular homeostasis. However, endothelial dysfunction or endothelial cell death can cause vascular barrier disruption, vasoconstriction and diastolic dysfunction, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, inflammatory responses, and thrombosis, which are closely associated with the progression of several diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, ischemic stroke, acute lung injury, acute kidney injury, diabetic retinopathy, and Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease. Oxidative stress caused by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important mechanism underlying endothelial cell death. Growing evidence suggests that ROS can trigger endothelial cell death in various ways, including pyroptosis, parthanatos, and ferroptosis. Therefore, this review will systematically illustrate the source of ROS in endothelial cells (ECs); reveal the molecular mechanism by which ROS trigger pyroptosis, parthanatos, and ferroptosis in ECs; and provide new ideas for the research and treatment of endothelial dysfunction-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circadian clock-based therapeutics in chronic pulmonary diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circadian clock is the biochemical oscillator that orchestrates the observable circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior. Disruption of the circadian clock in the lungs during chronic pulmonary diseases is considered one of the key etiological risk factors that drive pathobiology. Preclinical studies support that pharmacological manipulation of the circadian clock is a conceivable approach for the development of novel clock-based therapeutics. Despite recent advances, no effort has been undertaken to integrate novel findings for the treatment and management of chronic lung diseases. We, therefore, recognize the need to discuss the candidate clock genes that can be potentially targeted for therapeutic intervention. Here, we aim to create the first roadmap that will advance the development of circadian- clock-based therapeutics that may provide better outcomes in treating chronic pulmonary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberrant glucose metabolism is one of the most striking characteristics of metabolic reprogramming in cancer. Thus, clarifying the regulatory mechanism of glucose metabolism is crucial to understanding tumor progression and developing novel therapeutic strategies for cancer patients. Recent developments in circular RNAs have explained the regulatory mechanism of glucose metabolism from a new dimension. In this review, we briefly summarize the recent advances in circRNA research on cancer glucose metabolism and emphasize the different regulatory mechanisms, including acting as miRNA sponges, interacting with proteins and being translated into proteins. Additionally, we discuss the future research directions of circular RNAs in the field of glucose metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>After the Storm: Regeneration, Repair, and Reestablishment of Homeostasis Between the Alveolar Epithelium and Innate Immune System Following Viral Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36270292/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian lung has an enormous environmental-epithelial interface that is optimized to accomplish the principal function of the respiratory system, gas exchange. One consequence of evolving such a large surface area is that the lung epithelium is continuously exposed to toxins, irritants, and pathogens. Maintaining homeostasis in this environment requires a delicate balance of cellular signaling between the epithelium and innate immune system. Following injury, the epithelium can be either fully regenerated in form and function or repaired by forming dysplastic scar tissue. In this review, we describe the major mechanisms of damage, regeneration, and repair within the alveolar niche where gas exchange occurs. With a focus on viral infection, we summarize recent work that has established how epithelial proliferation is arrested during infection and how the innate immune system guides its reconstitution during recovery. The consequence of these processes going awry are also considered, with an emphasis on how this will impact postpandemic pulmonary biology and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a heterogeneous group of diseases that result in a common pathology, thrombotic microangiopathy, which is classically characterised by the triad of non-immune microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. In this Seminar, different causes of HUS are discussed, the most common being Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli HUS. Identifying the underlying thrombotic microangiopathy trigger can be challenging but is imperative if patients are to receive personalised disease-specific treatment. The quintessential example is complement-mediated HUS, which once carried an extremely high mortality but is now treated with anti-complement therapies with excellent long-term outcomes. Unfortunately, the high cost of anti-complement therapies all but precludes their use in low-income countries. For many other forms of HUS, targeted therapies are yet to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the global population becomes older, understanding the impact of aging on health and disease becomes paramount. Recent advancements in multiomic technology have allowed for the high-throughput molecular characterization of aging at the population level. Metabolomics studies that analyze the small molecules in the body can provide biological information across a diversity of aging processes. Here, we review the growing body of population-scale metabolomics research on aging in humans, identifying the major trends in the field, implicated biological pathways, and how these pathways relate to health and aging. We conclude by assessing the main challenges in the research to date, opportunities for advancing the field, and the outlook for precision health applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single-cell technologies: From research to application</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, more and more single-cell technologies have been developed. A vast amount of single-cell omics data has been generated by large projects, such as the Human Cell Atlas, the Mouse Cell Atlas, the Mouse RNA Atlas, the Mouse ATAC Atlas, and the Plant Cell Atlas. Based on these single-cell big data, thousands of bioinformatics algorithms for quality control, clustering, cell-type annotation, developmental inference, cell-cell transition, cell-cell interaction, and spatial analysis are developed. With powerful experimental single-cell technology and state-of-the-art big data analysis methods based on artificial intelligence, the molecular landscape at the single-cell level can be revealed. With spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multi-omics, even the spatial dynamic multi-level regulatory mechanisms can be deciphered. Such single-cell technologies have many successful applications in oncology, assisted reproduction, embryonic development, and plant breeding. We not only review the experimental and bioinformatics methods for single-cell research, but also discuss their applications in various fields and forecast the future directions for single-cell technologies. We believe that spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multi-omics will become the next booming business for mechanism research and commercial industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facts and Hopes in the Relationship of EBV with Cancer Immunity and Immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35686929/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the first identified human tumor virus, infects and takes up residency in almost every human. However, EBV genome-positive tumors arise in only a tiny minority of infected people, presumably when the virus-carrying tumor cells are able to evade immune surveillance. Traditional views regard viral antigens as the principal targets of host immune surveillance against virus-infected cells. However, recent findings indicate that EBV-infected/-transformed B cells elicit both cytotoxic CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell responses against a wide range of overexpressed cellular antigens known to function as tumor-associated antigens (TAA), in addition to various EBV-encoded antigens. This not only broadens the ways by which the immune system controls EBV infection and prevents it from causing cancers, but also potentially extends immune protection toward EBV-unrelated cancers by targeting shared TAAs. The goal of this review is to incorporate these new findings with literature data and discuss future directions for improved understanding of EBV-induced antitumor immunity, as well as the hopes for rational immune strategies for cancer prevention and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung Organoids in Smoking Research: Current Advances and Future Promises</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tobacco smoking has been established to contribute to the pathogenesis of various respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and asthma. However, major hurdles in mechanistic studies on the role of smoking in human lungs remain in part due to the lack of ex vivo experimental models and ambiguous data from animal models that can best recapitulate the architecture and pathophysiology of the human lung. Recent development of the lung organoid culture system has opened new avenues for respiratory disease research as organoids are proving to be a sophisticated ex vivo model that functionally and structurally mimics the human lungs better than other traditionally used models. This review will discuss how recent advances in lung organoid systems may help us better determine the injurious and immunological effect of smoking on human lungs and will provide some suggestions for future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lung epithelium development and airway regeneration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lung is composed of a highly branched airway structure, which humidifies and warms the inhaled air before entering the alveolar compartment. In the alveoli, a thin layer of epithelium is in close proximity with the capillary endothelium, allowing for an efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. During development proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells generates the lung architecture, and in the adult lung a proper function of progenitor cells is needed to regenerate after injury. Malfunctioning of progenitors during development results in various congenital lung disorders, such as Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) and Congenital Pulmonary Adenomatoid Malformation (CPAM). In addition, many premature neonates experience continuous insults on the lung caused by artificial ventilation and supplemental oxygen, which requires a highly controlled mechanism of airway repair. Malfunctioning of airway progenitors during regeneration can result in reduction of respiratory function or (chronic) airway diseases. Pathways that are active during development are frequently re-activated upon damage. Understanding the basic mechanisms of lung development and the behavior of progenitor cell in the ontogeny and regeneration of the lung may help to better understand the underlying cause of lung diseases, especially those occurring in prenatal development or in the immediate postnatal period of life. This review provides an overview of lung development and the cell types involved in repair of lung damage with a focus on the airway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defective genes account for âˆ¼80% of the total of more than 7,000 diseases known to date. Gene therapy brings the promise of a one-time treatment option that will fix the errors in patient genetic coding. Recombinant viruses are highly efficient vehicles for in vivo gene delivery. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors offer unique advantages, such as tissue tropism, specificity in transduction, eliciting of a relatively low immune responses, no incorporation into the host chromosome, and long-lasting delivered gene expression, making them the most popular viral gene delivery system in clinical trials, with three AAV-based gene therapy drugs already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA). Despite the success of AAV vectors, their usage in particular scenarios is still limited due to remaining challenges, such as poor transduction efficiency in certain tissues, low organ specificity, pre-existing humoral immunity to AAV capsids, and vector dose-dependent toxicity in patients. In the present review, we address the different approaches to improve AAV vectors for gene therapy with a focus on AAV capsid selection and engineering, strategies to overcome anti-AAV immune response, and vector genome design, ending with a glimpse at vector production methods and the current state of recombinant AAV (rAAV) at the clinical level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic modifications have received increasing attention and have been shown to be extensively involved in kidney development and disease progression. Among them, the most common RNA modification, N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A), has been shown to dynamically and reversibly exert its functions in multiple ways, including splicing, export, decay and translation initiation efficiency to regulate mRNA fate. Moreover, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A has also been reported to exert biological effects by destabilizing base pairing to modulate various functions of RNAs. Most importantly, an increasing number of kidney diseases, such as renal cell carcinoma, acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, have been found to be associated with aberrant m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A patterns. In this review, we comprehensively review the critical roles of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A in kidney diseases and discuss the possibilities and relevance of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-targeted epigenetic therapy, with an integrated comprehensive description of the detailed alterations in specific loci that contribute to cellular processes that are associated with kidney diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hedgehog pathway and its inhibitors in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36191777/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COPD affects millions of people and is now ranked as the third leading cause of death worldwide. This largely untreatable chronic airway disease results in irreversible destruction of lung architecture. The small lung hypothesis is now supported by epidemiological, physiological and clinical studies. Accordingly, the early and severe COPD phenotype carries the most dreadful prognosis and finds its roots during lung growth. Pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood and implicate individual susceptibility (genetics), a large part of environmental factors (viral infections, tobacco consumption, air pollution) and the combined effects of those triggers on gene expression. Genetic susceptibility is most likely involved as the disease is severe and starts early in life. The latter observation led to the identification of Mendelian inheritance via disease-causing variants of SERPINA1 - known as the basis for alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and TERT. In the last two decades multiple genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with COPD. High significance SNPs are located in 4q31 near HHIP which encodes an evolutionarily highly conserved physiological inhibitor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (HH). HHIP is critical to several in utero developmental lung processes. It is also implicated in homeostasis, injury response, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor resistance to apoptosis. A few studies have reported decreased HHIP RNA and protein levels in human adult COPD lungs. HHIP+/- murine models led to emphysema. HH pathway inhibitors, such as vismodegib and sonidegib, are already validated in oncology, whereas other drugs have evidenced in vitro effects. Targeting the Hedgehog pathway could lead to a new therapeutic avenue in COPD. In this review, we focused on the early and severe COPD phenotype and the small lung hypothesis by exploring genetic susceptibility traits that are potentially treatable, thus summarizing promising therapeutics for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important step in tumor progression, which enables tumor cells to acquire migration and invasion characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of biological biochanin A (BCA) in ameliorating fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) lung injury. The results showed that PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; could induce spindle-like changes in cell morphology, causing the ability of migration and invasion. However, they were significantly inhibited by BCA treatment (10/20/30 Î¼m). After BCA treatment, the release and transcription of chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor gene CXCR4 were inhibited, and the release of growth inducer TGF-Î²1 was significantly reduced. In addition, BCA promoted the transcription of E-cadherin and Î²-catenin, inhibiting the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin, and down-regulated the expression of MMP-2/9. We found that BCA effectively interfered with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activated by PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;. In conclusion, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; can induce EMT in lung cancer cells, and BCA may reverse this process by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor metastasis occurs in lung cancer, resulting in tumor progression and therapy failure. Anoikis is a mechanism of apoptosis that combats tumor metastasis; it inhibits the escape of tumor cells from the native extracellular matrix to other organs. Deciphering the regulators and mechanisms of anoikis in cancer metastasis is urgently needed to treat lung cancer. Several natural and synthetic products exhibit the pro-anoikis potential in lung cancer cells and in vivo models. These products include artonin E, imperatorin, oroxylin A, lupalbigenin, sulforaphane, renieramycin M, avicequinone B, and carbenoxolone. This review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anoikis regulation and relevant regulators involved in lung cancer metastasis and discusses the therapeutic potential of targeting anoikis in the treatment of lung cancer metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung diseases occupy a leading position in human morbidity and are the third leading cause of death. Often the chronic forms of these diseases do not respond to therapy, so that lung transplantation is the only treatment option. The development of cellular and biotechnologies offers a new solution-the use of lung organoids for transplantation in such patients. Here, we review types of lung organoids, methods of their production and characterization, and experimental works on transplantation in vivo. These results show the promise of work in this direction. Despite the current problems associated with a low degree of cell engraftment, immune response, and insufficient differentiation, we are confident that organoid transplantation will find it is clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanodrugs alleviate acute kidney injury: Manipulate RONS at kidney</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36203963/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AKI is a common clinical acute syndrome with high morbidity and mortality but without effective clinical drug available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hypoxia and accumulation of toxic substances are key pathological features of various heterogeneous AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive RONS is the core of the pathological mechanism of AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The development of nanodrugs is expected to achieve successful treatment in AKI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no clinical drugs available to treat acute kidney injury (AKI). Given the high prevalence and high mortality rate of AKI, the development of drugs to effectively treat AKI is a huge unmet medical need and a research hotspot. Although existing evidence fully demonstrates that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) burst at the AKI site is a major contributor to AKI progression, the heterogeneity, complexity, and unique physiological structure of the kidney make most antioxidant and anti-inflammatory small molecule drugs ineffective because of the lack of kidney targeting and side effects. Recently, nanodrugs with intrinsic kidney targeting through the control of size, shape, and surface properties have opened exciting prospects for the treatment of AKI. Many antioxidant nanodrugs have emerged to address the limitations of current AKI treatments. In this review, we systematically summarized for the first time about the emerging nanodrugs that exploit the pathological and physiological features of the kidney to overcome the limitations of traditional small-molecule drugs to achieve high AKI efficacy. First, we analyzed the pathological structural characteristics of AKI and the main pathological mechanism of AKI: hypoxia, harmful substance accumulation-induced RONS burst at the renal site despite the multifactorial initiation and heterogeneity of AKI. Subsequently, we introduced the strategies used to improve renal targeting and reviewed advances of nanodrugs for AKI: nano-RONS-sacrificial agents, antioxidant nanozymes, and nanocarriers for antioxidants and anti-inflammatory drugs. These nanodrugs have demonstrated excellent therapeutic effects, such as greatly reducing oxidative stress damage, restoring renal function, and low side effects. Finally, we discussed the challenges and future directions for translating nanodrugs into clinical AKI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emerged pathogenic human coronavirus that belongs to the sarbecovirus lineage of the genus Betacoronavirus. The ancestor strain has evolved into a number of variants of concern, with the Omicron variant of concern now having many distinct sublineages. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused serious damage to public health and the global economy, and one strategy to combat COVID-19 has been the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies for prophylactic and therapeutic use. Many are in preclinical and clinical development, and a few have been approved for emergency use. Here we summarize neutralizing antibodies that target four key regions within the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, namely the N-terminal domain and the receptor-binding domain in the S1 subunit, and the stem helix region and the fusion peptide region in the S2 subunit. Understanding the characteristics of these broadly neutralizing antibodies will accelerate the development of new antibody therapeutics and provide guidance for the rational design of next-generation vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gut microbiota-stem cell niche crosstalk: A new territory for maintaining intestinal homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/imt2.54/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are protected by their niche and are regulated by Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, and Notch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISCs and their relationship with intestinal microbiota provide a feasible pathway to alleviate intestinal diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diverse bacteria-related postbiotics regulate ISCs and maintain their homeostasis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intestinal epithelium undergoes rapid cellular turnover, relying on the local niche, to support intestinal stem cells (ISCs) function and self-renewal. Research into the association between ISCs and disease continues to expand at a rapid rate. However, the detailed interaction of ISCs and gut microbes remains to be elucidated. Thus, this review witnessed major advances in the crosstalk between ISCs and gut microbes, delivering key insights into (1) construction of ISC niche and molecular mechanism of how to jointly govern epithelial homeostasis and protect against intestinal diseases with the participation of Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, and Notch; (2) differentiation fate of ISCs affect the gut microbiota. Meanwhile, the presence of intestinal microbes also regulates ISC function; (3) microbiota regulation on ISCs by Wnt and Notch signals through pattern recognition receptors; (4) how do specific microbiota-related postbiotics influence ISCs to maintain intestinal epithelial regeneration and homeostasis that provide insights into a promising alternative therapeutic method for intestinal diseases. Considering the detailed interaction is still unclear, it is necessary to further explore the regulatory role of gut microbiota on ISCs to utilize microbes to alleviate gut disorders. Furthermore, these major advances collectively drive us ever closer to breakthroughs in regenerative medicine and cancer treatment by microbial transplantation in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With rapid and non-invasive characteristics, the respiratory route of administration has drawn significant attention compared with the limitations of conventional routes. Respiratory delivery can bypass the physiological barrier to achieve local and systemic disease treatment. A scientometric analysis and review were used to analyze how respiratory delivery can contribute to local and systemic therapy. The literature data obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection database showed an increasing worldwide tendency toward respiratory delivery from 1998 to 2020. Keywords analysis suggested that nasal and pulmonary drug delivery are the leading research topics in respiratory delivery. Based on the results of scientometric analysis, the research hotspots mainly included therapy for central nervous systems (CNS) disorders (Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease, depression, glioblastoma, and epilepsy), tracheal and bronchial or lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, acute lung injury or respiratory distress syndrome, lung cancer, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), and systemic diseases (diabetes and COVID-19). The study of advanced preparations contained nano drug delivery systems of the respiratory route, drug delivery barriers investigation (blood-brain barrier, BBB), and chitosan-based biomaterials for respiratory delivery. These results provided researchers with future research directions related to respiratory delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Hippo pathway and its correlation with acute kidney injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant clinical complication with a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality, for which therapeutic options remain limited. The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway implicated in cell proliferation, dedifferentiation, and apoptosis via phosphorylation and inactivation of its downstream effectors Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Recent studies have revealed that the Hippo pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and repair of AKI. The Hippo pathway can mediate renal dysfunction through modulation of mitochondrial apoptosis under AKI conditions. Transient activation of YAP/TAZ in the acute phase of AKI may benefit renal recovery and regeneration, whereas persistent activation of YAP/TAZ in severe AKI may lead to maladaptive repair and transition to chronic kidney disease. This review aims to summarize recent findings on the associations between the Hippo pathway and AKI and to identify new therapeutic targets and strategies for AKI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A potential new pathway for heparin treatment of sepsis-induced lung injury: inhibition of pulmonary endothelial cell pyroptosis by blocking hMGB1-LPS-induced caspase-11 activation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36189354/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a significant cause of mortality in critically ill patients. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a leading cause of death in these patients. Endothelial cells exposed to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can progress into pyroptosis, a programmed lysis of cell death triggered by inflammatory caspases. It is characterized by lytic cell death induced by the binding of intracellular LPS to caspases 4/5 in human cells and caspase-11 in mouse cells. In mice,caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis plays an important role in endotoxemia. HMGB1 released into the plasma binds to LPS and is internalized into lysosomes in endothelial cells via the advanced glycation end product receptor. In the acidic lysosomal environment, HMGB1 permeates the phospholipid bilayer, which is followed by the leakage of LPS into the cytoplasm and the activation of caspase-11. Heparin is an anticoagulant widely applied in the treatment of thrombotic disease. Previous studies have found that heparin could block caspase-11-dependent inflammatory reactions, decrease sepsis-related mortality, and reduce ALI, independent of its anticoagulant activity. Heparin or modified heparin with no anticoagulant property could inhibit the alarmin HMGB1-LPS interactions, minimize LPS entry into the cytoplasm, and thus blocking caspase-11 activation. Heparin has been studied in septic ALI, but the regulatory mechanism of pulmonary endothelial cell pyroptosis is still unclear. In this paper, we discuss the potential novel role of heparin in the treatment of septic ALI from the unique mechanism of pulmonary endothelial cell pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM2.5-induced lung injury was associated with the ferroptosis and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV pre-treatment attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury by inhibiting ferroptosis via Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astragaloside IV is a potential drug for prevention of PM2.5-induced respiratory disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt; Exposure to PM2.5 will increase the risk of respiratory disease and increase the burden of social health care. Astragaloside â…£ (Ast-IV) is one of the main biologically active substances form Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus, which owns various pharmacological effects. Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by accumulation of iron-dependent lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is not clear whether there are typical features of ferroptosis in PM2.5-induced lung injury. This study investigates whether PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice has a special form of ferroptosis and the specific protective mechanism of Ast-IV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjects and methods:&lt;/em&gt; Forty-two male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 7 per group): NS group (normal saline), Ast group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg), PM2.5 group, Ast-L group (Ast-IV 50 mg/kg + PM2.5), Ast-H group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + PM2.5) and Era group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + erastin 20 mg/kg + PM2.5). Mice were pre-treated with Ast-IV intraperitoneally for three days. Then, PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) was given by non-invasive tracheal instillation to induce lung injury. The ferroptosis&amp;rsquo; agonist erastin was used to verify the mechanism of Ast-IV anti-ferroptosis. 12 h after PM2.5 stimulation, the mice were euthanized. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum were collected for oxidative stress and cytokine determination. Lung tissues were collected for glutathione (GSH), tissue iron content, histology, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Ast-IV reduced the lung wet-dry ratio and the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and interleukin 1Î² (IL-1Î²) in serum. Ast-IV could also improve the oxidative stress level in BALF, restore the GSH level in the lung tissue, and reduce the iron content in the lung tissue. Western blot outcomes revealed that Ast-IV regulated the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to protect PM2.5-mediated lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; The protective effect of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice might be related to the inhibition of ferroptosis in lung tissue. Anti-ferroptosis might be a new mechanism of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The emerging mechanisms and functions of microautophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36097284/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Autophagy&amp;rsquo; refers to an evolutionarily conserved process through which cellular contents, such as damaged organelles and protein aggregates, are delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Different forms of autophagy have been described on the basis of the nature of the cargoes and the means used to deliver them to lysosomes. At present, the prevailing categories of autophagy in mammalian cells are macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy. The molecular mechanisms and biological functions of macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy have been extensively studied, but microautophagy has received much less attention. In recent years, there has been a growth in research on microautophagy, first in yeast and then in mammalian cells. Here we review this form of autophagy, focusing on selective forms of microautophagy. We also discuss the upstream regulatory mechanisms, the crosstalk between macroautophagy and microautophagy, and the functional implications of microautophagy in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders in humans. Future research into microautophagy will provide opportunities to develop novel interventional strategies for autophagy- and lysosome-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as Ross River virus, chikungunya virus and Oâ€™nyong-nyong virus, cause endemic disease globally and are a major public health concern. The hallmarks of arthritogenic alphavirus disease are debilitating pain, and potentially chronic inflammation of the muscles, thus influencing quality of life. The type I IFN response is a major component of the innate immune response against arthritogenic alphaviruses, and is essential in inhibiting viral replication and dissemination. Type I IFNs are induced during early stages of infection and are essential for the activation of the antiviral innate immune response. They also link the innate immune response and the activation of adaptive immunity. This review focuses on the host immune response, particularly that involving type I IFN, in arthritogenic alphavirus disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections can compromise the physical and biological functionalities of humans and pose a huge economical and psychological burden on infected patients. Nitric oxide (NO) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, whose mechanism of action is not affected by bacterial resistance. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an endogenous donor and carrier of NO, has gained increasing attention because of its potent antibacterial activity and efficient biocompatibility. Significant breakthroughs have been made in the application of GSNO in biomaterials. This review is based on the existing evidence that comprehensively summarizes the progress of antimicrobial GSNO applications focusing on their anti-infective performance, underlying antibacterial mechanisms, and application in anti-infective biomaterials. We provide an accurate overview of the roles and applications of GSNO in antibacterial biomaterials and shed new light on the avenues for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation and oxidative stress lead to various acute or chronic diseases, including pneumonia, liver and kidney injury, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer. Ginseng is a well-known and widely used ethnic medicine in Asian countries, and ginsenoside Rg3 is a saponin isolated from &lt;em&gt;Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Panax notoginseng&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Panax quinquefolius L&lt;/em&gt;. This compound has a wide range of pharmacological properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, which have been evaluated in disease models of inflammation and oxidative stress. Rg3 can attenuate lung inflammation, prevent liver and kidney function damage, mitigate neuroinflammation, prevent cerebral and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, and improve hypertension and diabetes symptoms. The multitarget, multipathway mechanisms of action of Rg3 have been gradually deciphered. This review summarizes the existing knowledge on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of ginsenoside Rg3, suggesting that ginsenoside Rg3 may be a promising candidate drug for the treatment of diseases with inflammatory and oxidative stress conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic and has severely affected socio-economic conditions and people&amp;rsquo;s life. The lung is the major target organ infected and (seriously) damaged by SARS-CoV-2, so a comprehensive understanding of the virus and the mechanism of infection are the first choices to overcome COVID-19. Recent studies have demonstrated the enormous value of human organoids as platforms for virological research, making them an ideal tool for researching host-pathogen interactions. In this study, the various existing lung organoids and their identification biomarkers and applications are summarized. At the same time, the seven coronaviruses currently capable of infecting humans are outlined. Finally, a detailed summary of existing studies on SARS-CoV-2 using lung organoids is provided and includes pathogenesis, drug development, and precision treatment. This review highlights the value of lung organoids in studying SARS-CoV-2 infection, bringing hope that research will alleviate COVID-19-associated lung infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular Mechanisms of Ferroptosis and Relevance to Cardiovascular Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36078133/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis has recently been demonstrated to be a novel regulated non-apoptotic cell death characterized by iron-dependence and the accumulation of lipid peroxidation that results in membrane damage. Excessive iron induces ferroptosis by promoting the generation of both soluble and lipid ROS via an iron-dependent Fenton reaction and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzyme activity. Cytosolic glutathione peroxidase 4 (cGPX4) pairing with ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) and mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase 4 (mGPX4) pairing with dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) serve as two separate defense systems to detoxify lipid peroxidation in the cytoplasmic as well as the mitochondrial membrane, thereby defending against ferroptosis in cells under normal conditions. However, disruption of these defense systems may cause ferroptosis. Emerging evidence has revealed that ferroptosis plays an essential role in the development of diverse cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as hemochromatosis-associated cardiomyopathy, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, heart failure (HF), atherosclerosis, and COVID-19-related arrhythmias. Iron chelators, antioxidants, ferroptosis inhibitors, and genetic manipulations may alleviate the aforementioned CVDs by blocking ferroptosis pathways. In conclusion, ferroptosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of various CVDs and suppression of cardiac ferroptosis is expected to become a potential therapeutic option. Here, we provide a comprehensive review on the molecular mechanisms involved in ferroptosis and its implications in cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of immune response in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: far beyond the Th1/Th2 imbalance</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35983984/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction:&lt;/em&gt; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease of unknown origin characterized by progressive scarring of the lung leading to irreversible loss of function. Despite the availability of two drugs that are able to slow down disease progression, IPF remains a deadly disease. The pathogenesis of IPF is poorly understood, but a dysregulated wound healing response following recurrent alveolar epithelial injury is thought to be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Areas covered:&lt;/em&gt; In the last few years, the role of the immune system in IPF pathobiology has been reconsidered; indeed, recent data suggest that a dysfunctional immune system may promote and unfavorable interplay with pro-fibrotic pathways thus acting as a cofactor in disease development and progression. In this article, we review and critically discuss the role of T cells in the pathogenesis and progression of IPF in the attempt to highlight ways in which further research in this area may enable the development of targeted immunomodulatory therapies for this dreadful disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expert opinion:&lt;/em&gt; A better understanding of T cell interactions has the potential to facilitate the development of immune modulators targeting multiple T cell-mediated pathways, thus halting disease initiation and progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is a pathological process that occurs in numerous organs throughout the human body and is frequently associated with severe cellular damage and death. Puerarin is an isoflavone compound extracted from the root of Pueraria lobata and has pharmacological effects such as dilating cerebral vessels and anti-free radical generation in cerebral ischemic tissues. With the deepening of experimental research and clinical research on puerarin, it has been found that puerarin has a protective effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of the heart, brain, spinal cord, lung, intestine and other organs. In summary, puerarin has a vast range of pharmacological effects and significant protective effects, and it also has obvious advantages in the clinical protection of patients with organ IRI. With the deepening of experimental pharmacological research and clinical research, it is expected to be an effective drug for IRI treatment. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the protective effect of puerarin on I/R organ injury and its possible underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanoparticles: Attractive tools to treat colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36028154/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite the notable advances achieved over the last few decades, CRC remains a hard-to-treat deadly disease in many patients. This is attributed mainly to chemo- and immuno-resistance, which frequently emerge soon after treatment with conventional therapeutics. Systemic treatments are also constrained by their many undesired and serious side effects. More recently, nanomedicine has emerged as an attractive modality that can overcome issues of therapeutic resistance, improper delivery, or suboptimal targeting of tumor cells. Many nanomaterials, having already been examined in pre-clinical and clinical studies, are now considered biocompatible and relatively safe. Indeed, around 50 nano-formulations have so far been approved as diagnostic and therapeutic agents in humans. Here, in this review, we describe a set of imperative nanoparticles (NPs) involved in diagnosing and treating CRC. In particular, we discuss the theragnostic roles of quantum dots, iron oxide NPs, Polylactide-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) NPs, dendrimer NPs, carbon nanotubes, liposomes, and gold NPs. We dissect the molecular and clinical evidence supporting the use of these NPs in CRC. We also highlight their implications in targeted drug delivery as well as their anti-tumorigenic properties and effects on the cardinal hallmarks of CRC. We conclude by highlighting the notion that nanomedicine is emerging as an attractive approach to address the unmet needs in managing several diseases, including CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effect of invasive mechanical ventilation on the diversity of the pulmonary microbiota</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35996150/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary microbial diversity may be influenced by biotic or abiotic conditions (e.g., disease, smoking, invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), etc.). Specially, invasive MV may trigger structural and physiological changes in both tissue and microbiota of lung, due to gastric and oral microaspiration, altered body posture, high O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation-induced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; toxicity in hypoxemic patients, impaired airway clearance and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which in turn reduce the diversity of the pulmonary microbiota and may ultimately lead to poor prognosis. Furthermore, changes in (local) O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration can reduce the diversity of the pulmonary microbiota by affecting the local immune microenvironment of lung. In conclusion, systematic literature studies have found that invasive MV reduces pulmonary microbiota diversity, and future rational regulation of pulmonary microbiota diversity by existing or novel clinical tools (e.g., lung probiotics, drugs) may improve the prognosis of invasive MV treatment and lead to more effective treatment of lung diseases with precision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fructose 1-phosphate, an evolutionary signaling molecule of abundancy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35995682/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence is accumulating that specifically fructose exerts adverse cardiometabolic effects in humans. Recent experimental studies have shown that fructose not only serves as a substrate for, among others, intrahepatic lipid formation, but also has a signaling function. It is postulated that fructose 1-phosphate (F1-P) has evolved as a signaling molecule of abundancy that stimulates nutrient absorption, lipid storage, and reproduction. Such a role would provide an explanation for why fructose contributes to the pathogenesis of evolutionary mismatch diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and colorectal cancer, in the current era of nutritional abundance. It is anticipated that reducing F1-P, by either pharmacological inhibition of ketohexokinase (KHK) or societal measures, will mitigate the risk of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that poses a major challenge in critical care medicine. The development of ALI/ARDS involves excessive inflammatory response, and macrophage autophagy plays an important role in regulating the inflammatory response in ALI/ARDS. In this paper, we review the effects of autophagy in regulating macrophage function, discuss the roles of macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS, and highlight drugs and other interventions that can modulate macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS to improve the understanding of the mechanism of macrophage autophagy in ALI/ARDS and provide new ideas and further research directions for the treatment of ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macrophages as tools and targets in cancer therapy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35974096/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumour-associated macrophages are an essential component of the tumour microenvironment and have a role in the orchestration of angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodelling, cancer cell proliferation, metastasis and immunosuppression, as well as in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Conversely, when appropriately activated, macrophages can mediate phagocytosis of cancer cells and cytotoxic tumour killing, and engage in effective bidirectional interactions with components of the innate and adaptive immune system. Therefore, they have emerged as therapeutic targets in cancer therapy. Macrophage-targeting strategies include inhibitors of cytokines and chemokines involved in the recruitment and polarization of tumour-promoting myeloid cells as well as activators of their antitumorigenic and immunostimulating functions. Early clinical trials suggest that targeting negative regulators (checkpoints) of myeloid cell function indeed has antitumor potential. Finally, given the continuous recruitment of myelomonocytic cells into tumour tissues, macrophages are candidates for cell therapy with the development of chimeric antigen receptor effector cells. Macrophage-centred therapeutic strategies have the potential to complement, and synergize with, currently available tools in the oncology armamentarium.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MicroRNAs in kidney injury and disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35974169/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by degrading or repressing the translation of their target messenger RNAs. As miRNAs are critical regulators of cellular homeostasis, their dysregulation is a crucial component of cell and organ injury. A substantial body of evidence indicates that miRNAs are involved in the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease and allograft damage. Different subsets of miRNAs are dysregulated during AKI, chronic kidney disease and allograft rejection, which could reflect differences in the physiopathology of these conditions. miRNAs that have been investigated in AKI include &lt;em&gt;miR-21&lt;/em&gt;, which has an anti-apoptotic role, and &lt;em&gt;miR-214&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;miR-668&lt;/em&gt;, which regulate mitochondrial dynamics. Various miRNAs are downregulated in diabetic kidney disease, including the &lt;em&gt;miR-30&lt;/em&gt; family and &lt;em&gt;miR-146a&lt;/em&gt;, which protect against inflammation and fibrosis. Other miRNAs such as miR-193 and miR-92a induce podocyte dedifferentiation in glomerulonephritis. In transplantation, miRNAs have been implicated in allograft rejection and injury. Further work is needed to identify and validate miRNAs as biomarkers of graft function and of kidney disease development and progression. Use of combinations of miRNAs together with other molecular markers could potentially improve diagnostic or predictive power and facilitate clinical translation. In addition, targeting specific miRNAs at different stages of disease could be a promising therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role, mechanism, and application of RNA methyltransferase METTL14 in gastrointestinal cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35974338/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gastrointestinal cancer is the most common human malignancy characterized by high lethality and poor prognosis. Emerging evidences indicate that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant post-transcriptional modification in eukaryotes, exerts important roles in regulating mRNA metabolism including stability, decay, splicing, transport, and translation. As the key component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) catalyzes m6A methylation on mRNA or non-coding RNA to regulate gene expression and cell phenotypes. Dysregulation of METTL14 was deemed to be involved in various aspects of gastrointestinal cancer, such as tumorigenesis, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis. Plenty of findings have opened up new avenues for exploring the therapeutic potential of gastrointestinal cancer targeting METTL14. In this review, we systematically summarize the recent advances regarding the biological functions of METTL14 in gastrointestinal cancer, discuss its potential clinical applications and propose the research forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigenetics, DNA damage, and aging</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a human lifespan, genome integrity erodes, leading to an increased abundance of several types of chromatin changes. The abundance of DNA lesions (chemical perturbations to nucleotides) increases with age, as does the number of genomic mutations and transcriptional disruptions caused by replication or transcription of those lesions, respectively. At the epigenetic level, precise DNA methylation patterns degrade, likely causing increasingly stochastic variations in gene expression. Similarly, the tight regulation of histone modifications begins to unravel. The genomic instability caused by these mechanisms allows transposon element reactivation and remobilization, further mutations, gene dysregulation, and cytoplasmic chromatin fragments. This cumulative genomic instability promotes cell signaling events that drive cell fate decisions and extracellular communications known to disrupt tissue homeostasis and regeneration. In this Review, we focus on age-related epigenetic changes and their interactions with age-related genomic changes that instigate these events.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial quality control in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury: new insights into mechanisms and implications</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35951200/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current effective method for the treatment of myocardial infarction is timely restoration of the blood supply to the ischemic area of the heart. Although reperfusion is essential for reestablishing oxygen and nutrient supplies, it often leads to additional myocardial damage, creating an important clinical dilemma. Reports from long-term studies have confirmed that mitochondrial damage is the critical mechanism in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Mitochondria are dynamic and possess a quality control system that targets mitochondrial quantity and quality by modifying mitochondrial fusion, fission, mitophagy, and biogenesis and protein homeostasis to maintain a healthy mitochondrial network. The system of mitochondrial quality control involves complex molecular machinery that is highly interconnected and associated with pathological changes such as oxidative stress, calcium overload, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Because of the critical role of the mitochondrial quality control systems, many reports have suggested that defects in this system are among the molecular mechanisms underlying myocardial reperfusion injury. In this review, we briefly summarize the important role of the mitochondrial quality control in cardiomyocyte function and focus on the current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and molecular pathways involved in mitochondrial quality control in cardiac I/R damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality. Currently, the primary treatment for ALI/ARDS is mainly symptomatic therapy such as mechanical ventilation and fluid management. Due to the lack of effective treatment strategies, most ALI/ARDS patients face a poor prognosis. The discovery of exosomes has created a promising prospect for the treatment of ALI/ARDS. Exosomes can exert anti-inflammatory effects, inhibit apoptosis, and promote cell regeneration. The microRNA contained in exosomes can participate in intercellular communication and play an immunomodulatory role in ALI/ARDS disease models. This review discusses the possible mechanisms of exosomes in ALI/ARDS to facilitate the development of innovative treatments for ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for acute respiratory failure: a review of potential indications, clinical practice and open research questions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) is a form of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) largely aimed at removing carbon dioxide in patients with acute hypoxemic or acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, so as to minimize respiratory acidosis, allowing more lung protective ventilatory settings which should decrease ventilator-induced lung injury. ECCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R is increasingly being used despite the lack of high-quality evidence, while complications associated with the technique remain an issue of concern. This review explains the physiological basis underlying the use of ECCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R, reviews the evidence regarding indications and contraindications, patient management and complications, and addresses organizational and ethical considerations. The indications and the risk-to-benefit ratio of this technique should now be carefully evaluated using structured national or international registries and large randomized trials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What has been learned by cytokine targeting of asthma?</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35934678/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airway inflammation in asthma involves complex, interactive, and redundant cascades mediated by an array of proinflammatory cytokines, including a type 2 (T2) pattern of injury. T2 inflammation is characterized by elevations in absolute peripheral or sputum eosinophil counts and levels of IgE (total and allergen-specific) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide, which serve as biomarkers for the presence of this type of inflammation. T2 inflammation is mediated by key &amp;ldquo;downstream&amp;rdquo; cytokines, particularly IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which act at the effector cell level, as well as upstream cytokines, or &amp;ldquo;alarmins,&amp;rdquo; such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-25, and IL-33 generated by epithelial cells. The relevance of these pathways has led to the development of biologic therapies targeting these T2 cytokines, which have not only resulted in modifying these biomarker signatures for inflammation but have also reduced the disease burden associated with asthma exacerbations, systemic corticosteroid use, and lung function compromises. This review will summarize experiences with anticytokine biologics to highlight which specific asthma outcomes they affect and how these effects reflect inflammatory pathways modified by biologics and may relate to pathophysiologic features of asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cellular senescence: the good, the bad and the unknown</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35922662/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellular senescence is a ubiquitous process with roles in tissue remodelling, including wound repair and embryogenesis. However, prolonged senescence can be maladaptive, leading to cancer development and age-related diseases. Cellular senescence involves cell-cycle arrest and the release of inflammatory cytokines with autocrine, paracrine and endocrine activities. Senescent cells also exhibit morphological alterations, including flattened cell bodies, vacuolization and granularity in the cytoplasm and abnormal organelles. Several biomarkers of cellular senescence have been identified, including SA-Î²gal, p16 and p21; however, few markers have high sensitivity and specificity. In addition to driving ageing, senescence of immune and parenchymal cells contributes to the development of a variety of diseases and metabolic disorders. In the kidney, senescence might have beneficial roles during development and recovery from injury, but can also contribute to the progression of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Therapies that target senescence, including senolytic and senomorphic drugs, stem cell therapies and other interventions, have been shown to extend lifespan and reduce tissue injury in various animal models. Early clinical trials confirm that senotherapeutic approaches could be beneficial in human disease. However, larger clinical trials are needed to translate these approaches to patient care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ellular senescence regulates physiological and homeostatic processes, particularly during embryonic development and wound healing, but can also be a pathological process that contributes to ageing, various diseases and metabolic disorders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senescent cells are characterized by morphological alterations including large, flat bodies and organelle abnormalities, as well as loss of physiological functions, an inability to proliferate and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SABG, p21 and p16 are the most commonly used senescence markers but have limitations; novel non-invasive approaches are needed to detect cellular senescence with high sensitivity and specificity in vitro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cellular senescence is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury, but also seems to have a protective role in the early stages of acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senescence-targeting interventions, including senolytic drugs conjugated to antibodies against Î²2-microglobulin, chimeric antigen receptor T cells and anti-ageing vaccines, show promise for clinical application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clinical trials are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of senotherapeutic approaches, optimize treatment regimens and develop more individualized and standardized treatment strategies.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosgene (COCl2) gas is a chemical intermediate of high-volume production with numerous industrial applications worldwide. Due to its high toxicity, accidental exposure to phosgene leads to various chemical injuries, primarily resulting in chemical-induced lung injury due to inhalation. Initially, the illness is mild and presents as coughing, chest tightness, and wheezing; however, within a few hours, symptoms progress to chronic respiratory depression, refractory pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, which may contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even death in severe cases. Despite rapid advances in medicine, effective treatments for phosgene-inhaled poisoning are lacking. Elucidating the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of acute inhalation toxicity caused by phosgene is necessary for the development of appropriate therapeutics. In this review, we discuss extant literature on relevant mechanisms and therapeutic strategies to highlight novel ideas for the treatment of phosgene-induced acute lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Platelets in the NETworks interweaving inflammation and thrombosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35979369/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platelets are well characterized for their indispensable role in primary hemostasis to control hemorrhage. Research over the past years has provided a substantial body of evidence demonstrating that platelets also participate in host innate immunity. The surface expression of pattern recognition receptors, such as TLR2 and TLR4, provides platelets with the ability to sense bacterial products in their environment. Platelet Î±-granules contain microbicidal proteins, chemokines and growth factors, which upon release may directly engage pathogens and/or contribute to inflammatory signaling. Additionally, platelet interactions with neutrophils enhance neutrophil activation and are often crucial to induce a sufficient immune response. In particular, platelets can activate neutrophils to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This specific neutrophil effector function is characterized by neutrophils expelling chromatin fibres decorated with histones and antimicrobial proteins into the extracellular space where they serve to trap and kill pathogens. Until now, the mechanisms and signaling pathways between platelets and neutrophils inducing NET formation are still not fully characterized. NETs were also detected in thrombotic lesions in several disease backgrounds, pointing towards a role as an interface between neutrophils, platelets and thrombosis, also known as immunothrombosis. The negatively charged DNA within NETs provides a procoagulant surface, and in particular NET-derived proteins may directly activate platelets. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the topic of immunothrombosis has become more relevant than ever, as a majority of COVID-19 patients display thrombi in the lung capillaries and other vascular beds. Furthermore, NETs can be found in the lung and other tissues and are associated with an increased mortality. Here, virus infiltration may lead to a cytokine storm that potently activates neutrophils and leads to massive neutrophil infiltration into the lung and NET formation. The resulting NETs presumably activate platelets and coagulation factors, further contributing to the subsequent emergence of microthrombi in pulmonary capillaries. In this review, we will discuss the interplay between platelets and NETs and the potential of this alliance to influence the course of inflammatory diseases. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and the identification of treatment targets is of utmost importance to increase patients&amp;rsquo; survival and improve the clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associations between age and the human microbiota are robust and reproducible. The microbial composition at several body sites can predict human chronological age relatively accurately. Although it is largely unknown why specific microorganisms are more abundant at certain ages, human microbiota research has elucidated a series of microbial community transformations that occur between birth and death. In this Review, we explore microbial succession in the healthy human microbiota from the cradle to the grave. We discuss the stages from primary succession at birth, to disruptions by disease or antibiotic use, to microbial expansion at death. We address how these successions differ by body site and by domain (bacteria, fungi or viruses). We also review experimental tools that microbiota researchers use to conduct this work. Finally, we discuss future directions for studying the microbiota&amp;rsquo;s relationship with age, including designing consistent, well-powered, longitudinal studies, performing robust statistical analyses and improving characterization of non-bacterial microorganisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of neutrophil extracellular traps in acute lung injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35967320/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a heterogeneous inflammatory condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. Neutrophils play a key role in the development of different forms of ALI, and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is emerging as a common pathogenic mechanism. NETs are essential in controlling pathogens, and their defective release or increased degradation leads to a higher risk of infection. However, NETs also contain several pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic molecules than can exacerbate thromboinflammation and lung tissue injury. To reduce NET-mediated lung damage and inflammation, DNase is frequently used in preclinical models of ALI due to its capability of digesting NET DNA scaffold. Moreover, recent advances in neutrophil biology led to the development of selective NET inhibitors, which also appear to reduce ALI in experimental models. Here we provide an overview of the role of NETs in different forms of ALI discussing existing gaps in our knowledge and novel therapeutic approaches to modulate their impact on lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Platelet extracellular vesicles and the secretory interactome join forces in health and disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35899405/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membrane-bound vesicles released by cells under various conditions. They are found in the extracellular milieu in all biological fluids. As the concentrations, contents, and origin of EVs can change during inflammation, the assessment of EVs can be used as a proxy of cellular activation. Here, we review the literature regarding EVs, more particularly those released by platelets and their mother cells, the megakaryocytes. Their cargo includes cytokines, growth factors, organelles (mitochondria and proteasomes), nucleic acids (messenger and non-coding RNA), transcription factors, and autoantigens. EVs may thus contribute to intercellular communication by facilitating exchange of material between cells. EVs also interact with other molecules secreted by cells. In autoimmune diseases, EVs are associated with antibodies secreted by B cells. By definition, EVs necessarily comprise a phospholipid moiety, which is thus the target of secreted phospholipases also abundantly expressed in the extracellular milieu. We discuss how platelet-derived EVs, which represent the majority of the circulating EVs, may contribute to immunity through the activity of their cargo or in combination with the secretory interactome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing is becoming widely employed to study biological processes at a novel resolution depth. The ability to analyse transcriptomes of multiple heterogeneous cell types in parallel is especially valuable for cell-focused lung research where a variety of resident and recruited cells are essential for maintaining organ functionality. We compared the single-cell transcriptomes from publicly available and unpublished datasets of the lungs in six different species: human (&lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;), African green monkey (&lt;em&gt;Chlorocebus sabaeus&lt;/em&gt;), pig (&lt;em&gt;Sus domesticus&lt;/em&gt;), hamster (&lt;em&gt;Mesocricetus auratus&lt;/em&gt;), rat (&lt;em&gt;Rattus norvegicus&lt;/em&gt;) and mouse (&lt;em&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/em&gt;) by employing RNA velocity and intercellular communication based on ligand-receptor co-expression, among other techniques. Specifically, we demonstrated a workflow for interspecies data integration, applied a single unified gene nomenclature, performed cell-specific clustering and identified marker genes for each species. Overall, integrative approaches combining newly sequenced as well as publicly available datasets could help identify species-specific transcriptomic signatures in both healthy and diseased lung tissue and select appropriate models for future respiratory research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer is one of the primary causes of death worldwide, and its morbidity and mortality rates are increasing rapidly. However, standard treatment modalities (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy) often fail to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic effect. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural nano-sized lipid bilayer vesicles secreted from cells. Owing to their advantages of low toxicity, high biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and inherent targeting, EVs can be exploited as drug delivery vectors for cancer treatment. In this review, we summarize the research progress of EV-based drug delivery systems in cancer treatment by focusing on four aspects: sources, cargo types, cargo loading methods and modification strategies. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anoikis is a programmed cell death occurring upon cell detachment from the correct extracellular matrix, thus disrupting integrin ligation. It is a critical mechanism in preventing dysplastic cell growth or attachment to an inappropriate matrix. Anoikis prevents detached epithelial cells from colonizing elsewhere and is thus essential for tissue homeostasis and development. As anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, two features associated with anoikis resistance, are crucial steps during tumour progression and metastatic spreading of cancer cells, anoikis deregulation has now evoked particular attention from the scientific community. The aim of this review is to analyse the molecular mechanisms governing both anoikis and anoikis resistance, focusing on their regulation in physiological processes, as well as in several diseases, including metastatic cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel role of COX6c in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35879322/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COX6c is one of the most important subunits of the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain in mitochondria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COX6c is closely related to a variety of diseases and can be used as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COX6c plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the OXPHOS pathway. Mitochondrial biogenesis can be stimulated in response to low temperature and is reflected in increases in the expression and activity of COX6c.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What extent are the activity and expression of COX6c altered in various diseases?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the change in COX6c a secondary event associated with other pathways that might be the primary drivers of the functional outcomes or is it specific to the disease?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the specific mechanisms and processes that COX6c participates in during the development of disease?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIc (COX6c) is one of the most important subunits of the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain in mitochondria. Numerous studies have demonstrated that COX6c plays a critical role in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and energy production. The release of COX6c from the mitochondria may be a hallmark of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Moreover, The changes in COX6c expression are widespread in a variety of diseases and can be chosen as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and treatment. In light of its exclusive effects, we present the elaborate roles that COX6c plays in various diseases. In this review, we first introduced basic knowledge regarding COX6c and its functions in the OXPHOS and apoptosis pathways. Subsequently, we described the regulation of COX6c expression and activity in both positive and negative ways. Furthermore, we summarized the elaborate roles that COX6c plays in various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, brain injury, skeletal muscle injury, and tumors. This review highlights recent advances and provides a comprehensive summary of COX6c in the regulation of OXPHOS in multiple diseases and may be helpful for drug design and the prediction, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and its severe form Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are the major cause of ICU death worldwide. ALI/ARDS is characterized by severe hypoxemia and inflammation that leads to poor lung compliance. Despite many advances in understanding and management, ALI/ARDS is still causing significant morbidity and mortality. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a fast-growing topic in lung inflammation and injury. lncRNA is a class of non-coding RNA having a length of more than 200 nucleotides. It has been a center of research for understanding the pathophysiology of various diseases in the past few years. Multiple studies have shown that lncRNAs are abundant in acute lung injury/injuries in mouse models and cell lines. By targeting these long non-coding RNAs, many investigators have demonstrated the alleviation of ALI in various mouse models. Therefore, lncRNAs show great promise as a therapeutic target in ALI. This review provides the current state of knowledge about the relationship between lncRNAs in various biological processes in acute lung injury and its use as a potential therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A roadmap for serum biomarkers for hepatitis B virus: current status and future outlook</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35859026/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, 296 million people are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and approximately one million people die annually from HBV-related causes, including liver cancer. Although there is a preventative vaccine and antiviral therapies suppressing HBV replication, there is no cure. Intensive efforts are under way to develop curative HBV therapies. Currently, only a few biomarkers are available for monitoring or predicting HBV disease progression and treatment response. As new therapies become available, new biomarkers to monitor viral and host responses are urgently needed. In October 2020, the International Coalition to Eliminate Hepatitis B Virus (ICE-HBV) held a virtual and interactive workshop on HBV biomarkers endorsed by the International HBV Meeting. Various stakeholders from academia, clinical practice and the pharmaceutical industry, with complementary expertise, presented and participated in panel discussions. The clinical utility of both classic and emerging viral and immunological serum biomarkers with respect to the course of infection, disease progression, and response to current and emerging treatments was appraised. The latest advances were discussed, and knowledge gaps in understanding and interpretation of HBV biomarkers were identified. This Roadmap summarizes the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges of HBV biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As new therapies for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection become available, new biomarkers to monitor viral and host responses are urgently needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Roadmap summarizes current knowledge on existing and emerging serum biomarkers in the context of chronic HBV infection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Roadmap discusses the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges of serum HBV biomarkers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Roadmap provides suggestions of the way forward to advance the biomarkers required to fast-track an HBV cure for all, irrespective of resources, HBV genotype or disease stage.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia is a central pathophysiological component in cancer, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, which represent the most common medical conditions resulting in long-term disability and death. Recent evidence suggests common signaling pathways in these diverse settings mediated by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are packaged in extracellular vesicles (EVs) protecting ncRNAs from degradation. EVs are a heterogeneous group of lipid bilayer-covered vesicles released from virtually all cells, which have important roles in intercellular communication. Recent studies pointed out that ncRNAs including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are selectively sorted into EVs, modulating specific aspects of cancer development, namely cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, immune tolerance or drug resistance, under conditions of hypoxia in recipient cells. In myocardial infarction and stroke, ncRNAs shuttled via EVs have been shown to control tissue survival and remodeling post-hypoxia by regulating cell injury, inflammatory responses, angiogenesis, neurogenesis or neuronal plasticity. This review discusses recent evidence on EV-associated ncRNAs in hypoxic cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke, discussing their cellular origin, biological function and disease significance. The emerging concept of lncRNA-circular RNA/ miRNA/ mRNA networks is outlined, upon which ncRNAs synergistically respond to hypoxia in order to modify disease responses. Particular notion is given to ncRNAs participating in at least two of the three conditions, which revealed a large degree of overlaps across pathophysiological conditions. Possible roles of EV-ncRNAs as therapeutic products or theranostic markers are defined.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acute effects of various respiratory viral infections have been well studied, with extensive characterization of the clinical presentation as well as viral pathogenesis and host responses. However, over the course of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence and prevalence of chronic sequelae after acute viral infections have become increasingly appreciated as a serious health concern. Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, alternatively described as &amp;ldquo;long COVID-19,&amp;rdquo; are characterized by symptoms that persist for longer than 28 days after recovery from acute illness. Although there exists substantial heterogeneity in the nature of the observed sequelae, this phenomenon has also been observed in the context of other respiratory viral infections including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In this Review, we discuss the various sequelae observed following important human respiratory viral pathogens and our current understanding of the immunological mechanisms underlying the failure of restoration of homeostasis in the lung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of Immuno-Inflammatory Signals in Liver Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35883665/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major obstacle in liver resection and liver transplantation. The initial step of IRI is mediated through ischemia which promotes the production of reactive oxygen species in Kupffer cells. This furthermore promotes the activation of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, interferon, inducible nitric oxide synthase, TLR9/nuclear-factor kappa B pathway, and the production of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as ATP, histone, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), urate, mitochondrial formyl peptides and S100 proteins. With ongoing cell death of hepatocytes during the ischemic phase, DAMPs are built up and released into the circulation upon reperfusion. This promotes a cytokines/chemokine storm that attracts neutrophils and other immune cells to the site of tissue injury. The effect of IRI is further aggravated by the release of cytokines and chemokines, such as epithelial neutrophil activating protein (CXCL5), KC (CXCL1) and MIP-2 (CXCL2), the complement proteins C3a and C5a, mitochondrial-derived formyl peptides, leukotriene B4 and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) from migrating neutrophils. These NETs can also activate platelets and form Neutrophil-platelet microthrombi to further worsen ischemia in the liver. In this review we aim to summarize the current knowledge of mediators that promote liver IRI, and we will discuss the role of neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps in mediating IRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Complement C3 activation in the ICU: Disease and therapy as Bonnie and Clyde</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) often straddle the divide between life and death. Understanding the complex underlying pathomechanisms relevant to such situations may help intensivists select broadly acting treatment options that can improve the outcome for these patients. As one of the most important defense mechanisms of the innate immune system, the complement system plays a crucial role in a diverse spectrum of diseases that can necessitate ICU admission. Among others, myocardial infarction, acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), organ failure, and sepsis are characterized by an inadequate complement response, which can potentially be addressed via promising intervention options. Often, ICU monitoring and existing treatment options rely on massive intervention strategies to maintain the function of vital organs, and these approaches can further contribute to an unbalanced complement response. Artificial surfaces of extracorporeal organ support devices, transfusion of blood products, and the application of anticoagulants can all trigger or amplify undesired complement activation. It is, therefore, worth pursuing the evaluation of complement inhibition strategies in the setting of ICU treatment. Recently, clinical studies in COVID-19-related ARDS have shown promising effects of central inhibition at the level of C3 and paved the way for prospective investigation of this approach. In this review, we highlight the fundamental and often neglected role of complement in the ICU, with a special focus on targeted complement inhibition. We will also consider complement substitution therapies to temporarily counteract a disease/treatment-related complement consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human respiratory viruses induce a wide breadth of disease phenotypes and outcomes of varying severity. Innovative models that recapitulate the human respiratory tract are needed to study such viruses, understand the virus-host interactions underlying replication and pathogenesis, and to develop effective countermeasures for prevention and treatment. Human organoid models provide a platform to study virus-host interactions in the proximal to distal lung in the absence of a human in vivo model. These cultures fill the niche of a suitable ex vivo model that represents the in vivo lung environment and encapsulates the structure and function of the native human lung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Circulating Tumor DNA in Colorectal Cancer: Current and Evolving Practices</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35839443/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exists a tremendous opportunity in identifying and determining the appropriate predictive and prognostic biomarker(s) for risk stratification of patients with colorectal cancers (CRCs). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising prognostic and possibly predictive biomarker in the personalized management of patients with CRCs. The disease is particularly suited to a liquid biopsy-based approach since there is a great deal of shedding of circulating tumor fragments (cells, DNA, methylation markers, etc). ctDNA has been shown to have several potential applications, including detecting minimal residual disease (MRD), monitoring for early recurrence, molecular profiling, and therapeutic response prediction. The utility of ctDNA has broadened from its initial use in the advanced/metastatic setting for molecular profiling and detection of acquired resistance mechanisms, toward identifying MRD, as well as early detection. Prospective studies such as CIRCULATE, COBRA, Dynamic II/III, and ACT3 are underway in the MRD setting to further understand how ctDNA may be used to inform clinical decision making using both tumor-informed and tumor-agnostic platforms. These prospective studies use ctDNA to guide management of patients with CRC and will be critical to help guide how and where ctDNA should or should not be used in clinical decision making. It is also important to understand that there are different types of ctDNA liquid biopsy platforms, each with advantages and disadvantages in different clinical indications. This review provides an overview of the current and evolving use of ctDNA in CRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human gut virome, which is often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;dark matter&amp;rdquo; of the gut microbiome, remains understudied. A better understanding of the composition and variations of the gut virome across populations is critical for exploring its impact on diseases and health. A series of advances in the characterization of human gut virome have unveiled high genetic diversity and various functional potentials of gut viruses. Here, we summarize the recently available human gut virome databases and discuss their features, procedures, and challenges with the intention to provide a reference to researchers to use while choosing a profiling database. We also propose a &amp;ldquo;best practice&amp;rdquo; for cataloging the viral population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>E-cigarette vaping associated acute lung injury (EVALI): state of science and future research needs</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35822508/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;E-Cigarette (e-cig) Vaping-Associated Acute Lung Injury&amp;rdquo; (EVALI) has been linked to vitamin-E-acetate (VEA) and Î”-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), due to their presence in patients&amp;rsquo; e-cigs and biological samples. Lacking standardized methodologies for patients&amp;rsquo; data collection and comprehensive physicochemical/toxicological studies using real-world-vapor exposures, very little data are available, thus the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of EVALI is still unknown. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical appraisal of existing literature on clinical/epidemiological features and physicochemical-toxicological characterization of vaping emissions associated with EVALI. The literature review of 161 medical case reports revealed that the predominant demographic pattern was healthy white male, adolescent, or young adult, vaping illicit/informal THC-containing e-cigs. The main histopathologic pattern consisted of diffuse alveolar damage with bilateral ground-glass-opacities at chest radiograph/CT, and increased number of macrophages or neutrophils and foamy-macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage. The chemical analysis of THC/VEA e-cig vapors showed a chemical difference between THC/VEA and the single THC or VEA. The chemical characterization of vapors from counterfeit THC-based e-cigs or in-house-prepared e-liquids using either cannabidiol (CBD), VEA, or medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), identified many toxicants, such as carbonyls, volatile organic compounds, terpenes, silicon compounds, hydrocarbons, heavy metals, pesticides and various industrial/manufacturing/automotive-related chemicals. There is very scarce published toxicological data on emissions from THC/VEA e-liquids. However, CBD, MCT, and VEA emissions exert varying degrees of cytotoxicity, inflammation, and lung damage, depending on puffing topography and cell line. Major knowledge gaps were identified, including the need for more systematic-standardized epidemiological surveys, comprehensive physicochemical characterization of real-world e-cig emissions, and mechanistic studies linking emission properties to specific toxicological outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advances in the Regulation of Macrophage Polarization by Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Implications for ALI/ARDS Treatment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a common condition with high mortality. ALI/ARDS is caused by multiple etiologies, and the main clinical manifestations are progressive dyspnea and intractable hypoxemia. Currently, supportive therapy is the main ALI/ARDS treatment, and there remains a lack of targeted and effective therapeutic strategies. Macrophages are important components of innate immunity. M1 macrophages are pro-inflammatory, while M2 macrophages are anti-inflammatory and promote tissue repair. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are stem cells with broad application prospects in tissue regeneration due to their multi-directional differentiation potential along with their anti-inflammatory and paracrine properties. MSCs can regulate the balance of M1/M2 macrophage polarization to improve the prognosis of ALI/ARDS. In this paper, we review the mechanisms by which MSCs regulate macrophage polarization and the signaling pathways associated with polarization. This review is expected to provide new targets for the treatment of ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HuR as a molecular target for cancer therapeutics and immune-related disorders</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35817212/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control of eukaryotic gene expression occurs at multiple levels, from transcription to messenger RNA processing, transport, localization, turnover, and translation. RNA-binding proteins control gene expression and are involved in different stages of mRNA processing, including splicing, maturation, turnover, and translation. A ubiquitously expressed RBP Human antigen R is engaged in the RNA processes mentioned above but, most importantly, controls mRNA stability and turnover. Dysregulation of HuR is linked to many diseases, including cancer and other immune-related disorders. HuR targets mRNAs containing AU-rich elements at their 3&amp;rsquo;untranslated region, which encodes proteins involved in cell growth, proliferation, tumor formation, angiogenesis, immune evasion, inflammation, invasion, and metastasis. HuR overexpression has been reported in many tumor types, which led to a poor prognosis for patients. Hence, HuR is considered an appealing drug target for cancer treatment. Therefore, multiple attempts have been made to identify small molecule inhibitors for blocking HuR functions. This article reviews the current prospects of drugs that target HuR in numerous cancer types, their mode of action, and off-target effects. Furthermore, we will summarize drugs that interfered with HuR-RNA interactions and established themselves as novel therapeutics. We will also highlight the significance of HuR overexpression in multiple cancers and discuss its role in immune functions. This review provides evidence of a new era of HuR-targeted small molecules that can be used for cancer therapeutics either as a monotherapy or in combination with other cancer treatment modalities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Context-specific regulation and function of mRNA alternative polyadenylation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35798852/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread mechanism to generate mRNA isoforms with alternative 3&amp;rsquo; untranslated regions (UTRs). The expression of alternative 3&amp;rsquo; UTR isoforms is highly cell type specific and is further controlled in a gene-specific manner by environmental cues. In this Review, we discuss how the dynamic, fine-grained regulation of APA is accomplished by several mechanisms, including cis-regulatory elements in RNA and DNA and factors that control transcription, pre-mRNA cleavage and post-transcriptional processes. Furthermore, signalling pathways modulate the activity of these factors and integrate APA into gene regulatory programmes. Dysregulation of APA can reprogramme the outcome of signalling pathways and thus can control cellular responses to environmental changes. In addition to the regulation of protein abundance, APA has emerged as a major regulator of mRNA localization and the spatial organization of protein synthesis. This role enables the regulation of protein function through the addition of post-translational modifications or the formation of protein-protein interactions. We further discuss recent transformative advances in single-cell RNA sequencing and CRISPR-Cas technologies, which enable the mapping and functional characterization of alternative 3&amp;rsquo; UTRs in any biological context. Finally, we discuss new APA-based RNA therapeutics, including compounds that target APA in cancer and therapeutic genome editing of degenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and causes great mortality. ALI presents with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, cell death, destruction of alveoli-endothelial barriers, and neutrophil infiltration in lung tissues. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules released from damaged cells due to infection, trauma, etc. DAMPs activate innate and adaptive immunity, trigger inflammatory responses, and are important in the initiation and development of ALI. We reviewed the literatures on DAMPs in ALI. Alveolar macrophages (AMs), neutrophils, and epithelial cells (AECs) are important in the pathogenesis of ALI. We comprehensively analyzed the interaction between DAMPs and AMs, alveolar neutrophils, and AECs. During the initial stage of ALI, ruptured cell membranes or destroyed mitochondria release DAMPs. DAMPs activate the inflammasome in nearby sentinel immune cells, such as AMs. AMs produce IL-1Î² and other cytokines. These mediators upregulate adhesion molecules of the capillary endothelium that facilitate neutrophil recruitment. The recruited neutrophils detect DAMPs using formyl peptide receptors on the membrane, guiding their migration to the injured site. The accumulation of immune cells, cytokines, chemokines, proteases, etc., results in diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary hyperpermeability with protein-rich fluid retention. Some clinical studies have shown that patients with ALI with higher circulating DAMPs have higher mortality rates. In conclusion, DAMPs are important in the initiation and progression of ALI. The interactions between DAMPs and AMs, neutrophils, and AECs are important in ALI. This review comprehensively addresses the mechanisms of DAMPs and their interactions in ALI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neutrophil and Macrophage Response in Acinetobacter Baumannii Infection and Their Relationship to Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35873147/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) infection has become a threat to global public health. AB is one of the main pathogens causing nosocomial infections, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia. AB easily develops resistance against a variety of antibiotics, which makes the treatment of AB infections difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to study new treatment plans like anti-infection immunity. Both animal models of AB infection and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; cell experiments show that macrophages are activated in the early stage of the immune response and regulate the recruitment of neutrophils, thus playing a role in clearing AB. AB components and the immune responses they induce can lead to injury of the infected organ, mostly in the lungs. Understanding the response of innate immunity to ABs at different stages after infection and the relationship between the response and lung injury can help to develop new immunotherapy methods and prevent lung injury. This article provides a comprehensive review of the response of neutrophils and macrophages to AB infection and their association with lung injury to develop effective therapies for AB infection and prevent lung injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is an intracellular self-digestion mechanism, by which cellular components are sorted into double-membrane autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Cells use autophagy to dispose of wastes and eliminate hazards, while recycling nutrients and tuning metabolism in the process. Through these functions, autophagy promotes cell fitness, genome integrity, tissue homeostasis, and cell survival and growth under stress. Both autophagy upregulation and downregulation have been found in human cancers, suggesting a complex role in tumor development. Accumulating results from autophagy-deficient mice and mouse models of human cancers have demonstrated that autophagy generally suppresses tumor initiation, but promotes tumor progression, in a manner that is dependent on timing and context and modified by specific tumorigenic events. Given the role of autophagy in facilitating tumor growth, autophagy inhibition has gained wide attention as a potential anticancer therapy. Here, we summarize relevant genetic, preclinical, and clinical studies and discuss the multifaceted role of autophagy in cancer, as well as the prospects of autophagy inhibition for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kidney diseases are global public health concerns lacking effective treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both native and bioengineered EVs are prime candidates for next-generation renal therapeutics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVs can be tailored to target specific renal cells and prolong kidney retention for enhanced efficacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVs can act as natural therapeutic agents or smart drug carriers fighting against renal diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the ever-increasing burden of kidney disease, the need for developing new therapeutics to manage this disease has never been greater. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural membranous nanoparticles present in virtually all organisms. Given their excellent delivery capacity in the body, EVs have emerged as a frontier technology for drug delivery and have the potential to usher in a new era of nanomedicine for kidney disease. This review is focused on why EVs are such compelling drug carriers and how to release their fullest potentiality in renal therapeutics. We discuss the unique features of EVs compared to artificial nanoparticles and outline the engineering technologies and steps in developing EV-based therapeutics, with an emphasis on the emerging approaches to target renal cells and prolong kidney retention. We also explore the applications of EVs as natural therapeutics or as drug carriers in the treatment of renal disorders and present our views on the critical challenges in manufacturing EVs as next-generation renal therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung epithelium is constantly exposed to the environment and is critically important for the orchestration of initial responses to infectious organisms, toxins, and allergic stimuli, and maintenance of normal gaseous exchange and pulmonary function. The integrity of lung epithelium, fluid balance, and transport of molecules is dictated by the tight junctions (TJs). The TJs are formed between adjacent cells. We have focused on the topic of the TJ structure and function in lung epithelial cells. This review includes a summary of the last twenty years of literature reports published on the disrupted TJs and epithelial barrier in various lung conditions and expression and regulation of specific TJ proteins against pathogenic stimuli. We discuss the molecular signaling and crosstalk among signaling pathways that control the TJ structure and function. The Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) recognizes the pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns released during lung injury and inflammation and coordinates cellular responses. The molecular aspects of TLR4 signaling in the context of TJs or the epithelial barrier are not fully known. We describe the current knowledge and possible networking of the TLR4-signaling with cellular and molecular mechanisms of TJs, lung epithelial barrier function, and resistance to treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herpesviruses belong to large double-stranded DNA viruses. They are under a wide range of hosts and establish lifelong infection, which creates a burden on human health and animal health. Innate immunity is the host&amp;rsquo;s innate defense ability. Activating the innate immune signaling pathway and producing type I interferon is the host&amp;rsquo;s first line of defense against infectious pathogens. Emerging evidence indicates that the cGAS-STING signaling pathway plays an important role in the innate immunity in response to herpesvirus infections. In parallel, because of the constant selective pressure imposed by host immunity, herpesvirus also evolves to target the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to inhibit or escape the innate immune responses. In the current review, we insight on the classical cGAS-STING signaling pathway. We describe the activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway during herpesvirus infections and strategies of herpesvirus targeting this pathway to evade host antiviral response. Furthermore, we outline the immunotherapy boosting cGAS-STING signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a novel cell death method discovered in recent years. It is usually accompanied by massive accumulations of iron and lipid peroxidation during cell death. Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis is closely associated with the pathophysiological processes of many diseases, such as tumors, neurological diseases, localized ischemia-reperfusion injury, kidney injury, and hematological diseases. How to intervene in the incidence and development of associated diseases by regulating the ferroptosis of cells has become a hot topic of research. This article provides a review of the role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of acute kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging role of exosomes in cancer progression and tumor microenvironment remodeling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35765040/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and the factors responsible for its progression need to be elucidated. Exosomes are structures with an average size of 100 nm that can transport proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. This review focuses on the role of exosomes in cancer progression and therapy. We discuss how exosomes are able to modulate components of the tumor microenvironment and influence proliferation and migration rates of cancer cells. We also highlight that, depending on their cargo, exosomes can suppress or promote tumor cell progression and can enhance or reduce cancer cell response to radio- and chemo-therapies. In addition, we describe how exosomes can trigger chronic inflammation and lead to immune evasion and tumor progression by focusing on their ability to transfer non-coding RNAs between cells and modulate other molecular signaling pathways such as PTEN and PI3K/Akt in cancer. Subsequently, we discuss the use of exosomes as carriers of anti-tumor agents and genetic tools to control cancer progression. We then discuss the role of tumor-derived exosomes in carcinogenesis. Finally, we devote a section to the study of exosomes as diagnostic and prognostic tools in clinical courses that is important for the treatment of cancer patients. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of exosomes in cancer therapy, focusing on their therapeutic value in cancer progression and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumors refractory to conventional therapy belong to specific subpopulations of cancer cells, which have acquired a higher number of mutations/epigenetic changes than the majority of cancer cells. This property provides them the ability to become resistant to therapy. Aberrant expression of certain RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can regulate the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs by binding to specific regions present in the 3Â´-UTR of certain mRNAs to promote or repress mRNA translation or by interacting with other proteins (including RBPs) and non-coding RNAs that are part of ribonucleoprotein complexes. In particular, an increasing interest in the RBPs involved in chemoresistance has recently emerged. In this review, we discuss how RBPs are not only affected by chemotherapeutic treatments, but also play an active role in therapeutic responses via the direct modulation of crucial cancer-related proteins. A special focus is being placed on the development of therapeutic strategies targeting these RBPs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Untapping the protective role of carotenoids against respiratory diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35820304/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt; Recent studies revealed a substantial role of carotenoids to treat respiratory diseases. This review aimed to give an updated overview of the investigational evidence on the preventive properties of carotenoids against respiratory diseases both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; along with their pathophysiology and mechanisms of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypothesis:&lt;/em&gt; Carotenoids as a potential therapeutic class of bioactive compounds to treat respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Carotenoids such as Î²-carotene, lycopene, crocin, bixin, lutein, and astaxanthin show beneficial effects against chronic lung diseases (e.g., asthma, emphysema, fibrosis, COPD, acute lung injury, and lung cancer). Moreover, &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; studies also supported the preventive role of carotenoids. These carotenoids showed a beneficial role by activation of the NRF2/HO-1 pathway and inhibition of the NF-ÐºB, MAPK, JAK/STAT-3, and PI3K/AKT pathways. Additionally, epidemiological studies also showed that dietary intake of carotenoids lowers the risk of lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; Carotenoids may be used as drugs or can be given in combination with other drugs to prevent and treat respiratory diseases. Although &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; results are encouraging, further well-conducted randomized clinical trials are required to approve carotenoids as drug candidat&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a distinct type of programmed cell death (PCD) that depends on iron and is characterized by the accumulation of intracellular iron, exhaustion of glutathione, deactivation of glutathione peroxidase, and promotion of lipid peroxidation. Recently, accumulated investigations have demonstrated that ferroptosis is strongly correlated with the initiation and development of many lung diseases. In this review, we summarized the contribution of ferroptosis to the pathologic process of lung diseases, namely, obstructive lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cystic fibrosis), interstitial lung diseases (pulmonary fibrosis of different causes), pulmonary diseases of vascular origin (ischemia-reperfusion injury and pulmonary hypertension), pulmonary infections (bacteria, viruses, and fungi), acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and lung cancer. We also discussed the therapeutic potential of targeting ferroptosis for these lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updated Views on Neutrophil Responses in Ischemiaâ€“Reperfusion Injury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia-reperfusion injury is an inevitable event during organ transplantation and represents a primary risk factor for the development of early graft dysfunction in lung, heart, liver, and kidney transplant recipients. Recent studies have implicated recipient neutrophils as key mediators of this process and also have found that early innate immune responses after transplantation can ultimately augment adaptive alloimmunity and affect late graft outcomes. Here, we discuss signaling pathways involved in neutrophil recruitment and activation after ischemia-mediated graft injury in solid organ transplantation with an emphasis on lung allografts, which have been the focus of recent studies. These findings suggest novel therapeutic interventions that target ischemia-reperfusion injury-mediated graft dysfunction in transplant recipients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of gut microbiota in regulating the intestinal homeostasis, as well as the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury (PALI) is widely recognized. The bioactive functions of metabolites with small molecule weight and the detail molecular mechanisms of PALI mediated by &amp;ldquo;gut-lung axis&amp;rdquo; have gradually raised the attentions of researchers. Several studies have proved that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbiome play crucial roles and varied activities in the process of PALI. However, relevant reviews reporting SCFAs in the involvement of PALI is lacking. In this review, we firstly introduced the synthetic and metabolic pathways of SCFAs, as well as the transport and signal transduction routes in brief. Afterwards, we focused on the possible mechanisms and clues of SCFAs to participate in the fight against PALI which referred to the inhibition of pathogen proliferation, anti-inflammatory effects, enhancement of intestinal barrier functions, and the maintenance and regulation of immune homeostasis via pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In addition, the latest reported pathological and physiological mechanisms of the gut-lung axis involved in PALI were reviewed. Finally, we summarized the potential therapeutic interventions of PALI by targeting SCFAs, including dietary fiber supplementation, direct supplementation of SCFAs/prebiotics/probiotics, and drugs administration, which is expected to provide new sights for clinical use in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long non-coding RNA MIR4435-2HG: a key molecule in progression of cancer and non-cancerous disorders</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35715800/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIR4435-2HG (LINC00978) is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that acts as an oncogene in almost all cancers. This lncRNA participates in the molecular cascades involved in other disorders such as coronary artery diseases, osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and periodontitis. MIR4435-2HG exerts its functions via the spectrum of different mechanisms, including inhibition of apoptosis, sponging microRNAs (miRNAs), promoting cell proliferation, increasing cell invasion and migration, and enhancing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). MIR4435-2HG can regulate several signaling pathways, including Wnt, TGF-Î²/SMAD, Nrf2/HO-1, PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, and FAK/AKT/Î²â€‘catenin signaling pathways; therefore, it can lead to tumor progression. In the present review, we aimed to discuss the potential roles of lncRNA MIR4435-2HG in developing cancerous and non-cancerous conditions. Due to its pivotal role in different disorders, this lncRNA can serve as a potential biomarker in future investigations. Moreover, it may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regeneration-Associated Transitional State Cells in Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35743199/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial disease. It is characterized by fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast activation, and massive extracellular matrix deposition. These processes result in loss of lung parenchyma function. The transdifferentiation of alveolar epithelial type II (AEC2) to alveolar epithelial type I cells (AEC1) plays an important role in the epithelial repair after lung injury. Pulmonary fibrosis begins when this transdifferentiation process is blocked. Several recent studies have found that novel transitional state cells (intermediate states in the transdifferentiation of AEC2 to AEC1) can potentially regenerate the alveolar epithelium surface and promote a repair process. During the AEC2 to AEC1 trans-differentiation process after injury, AEC2 lose their specific markers and become transitional state cells. Furthermore, transdifferentiation of transitional state cells into AEC1 is the critical step for lung repair. However, transitional cells stagnate in the intermediate states in which failure of transdifferentiation to AEC1 may induce an inadequate repair process and pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we focus on the traits, origins, functions, and activation of signaling pathways of the transitional state cell and its communication with other cells. We also provide a new opinion on pulmonary fibrosis pathogenesis mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circulating tissue factor-positive extracellular vesicles and their association with thrombosis in different diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue factor (TF) is a procoagulant protein released from activated host cells, such as monocytes, and tumor cells on extracellular vesicles (EVs). TF + EVs are observed in the circulation of patients with various types of diseases. In this review, we will summarize the association between TF + EVs and activation of coagulation and survival in different types of diseases, including cancer, sepsis, and infections with different viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus (IAV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We will also discuss the source of TF + EVs in various diseases. EVTF activity is associated with thrombosis in pancreatic cancer patients and coronavirus disease 2019 patients (COVID-19) and with disseminated intravascular coagulation in cancer patients. EVTF activity is also associated with worse survival in patients with cancer and COVID-19. Monocytes are the major sources of TF + EVs in sepsis, and viral infections, such as HIV, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, alveolar epithelial cells are the major source of TF + EVs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in COVID-19 and influenza A patients. These studies indicate that EVTF activity could be used as a biomarker to identify patients that have an increased risk of coagulopathy and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once thought to be sterile, the human lung is now well recognized to harbor a consortium of microorganisms collectively known as the lung microbiome. The lung microbiome is altered in an array of lung diseases, including chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and bronchiectasis, acute lung diseases caused by pneumonia, sepsis, and COVID-19, and other lung complications such as those related to lung transplantation, lung cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus. The effects of lung microbiome in modulating host immunity and inflammation in the lung and distal organs are being elucidated. However, the precise mechanism by which members of microbiota produce structural ligands that interact with host genes and pathways remains largely uncharacterized. Multiple unique challenges, both technically and biologically, exist in the field of lung microbiome, necessitating the development of tailored experimental and analytical approaches to overcome the bottlenecks. In this review, we first provide an overview of the principles and methodologies in studying the lung microbiome. We next review current knowledge of the roles of lung microbiome in human diseases, highlighting mechanistic insights. We finally discuss critical challenges in the field and share our thoughts on broad topics for future investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening lung injury characterized by an acute inflammatory response in the lung parenchyma. Hence, it is considered as the most appropriate clinical syndrome to study pathogenic mechanisms of lung inflammation. ARDS is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU), while no effective pharmacological treatment exists. It is very important therefore to fully characterize the underlying pathobiology and the related mechanisms, in order to develop novel therapeutic approaches. In vivo and in vitro models are important pre-clinical tools in biological and medical research in the mechanistic and pathological understanding of the majority of diseases. In this review, we will present data from selected experimental models of lung injury/acute lung inflammation, which have been based on clinical disorders that can lead to the development of ARDS and related inflammatory lung processes in humans, including ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI), sepsis, ischemia/reperfusion, smoke, acid aspiration, radiation, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), influenza, &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;S.&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; and coronaviruses infection. Data from the corresponding clinical conditions will also be presented. The mechanisms related to lung inflammation that will be covered are oxidative stress, neutrophil extracellular traps, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, surfactant, and water and ion channels. Finally, we will present a brief overview of emerging techniques in the field of omics research that have been applied to ARDS research, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, which may recognize factors to help stratify ICU patients at risk, predict their prognosis, and possibly, serve as more specific therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play a key role in health and disease by presenting antigen to T-lymphocytes for immunosurveillance. Immunopeptidomics involves the study of the collection of peptides presented within the antigen-binding groove of HLA molecules. Identifying their nature and diversity is crucial to understanding immunosurveillance especially during infection or for the recognition and potential eradication of tumours. This review discusses recent advances in the isolation, identification, and quantitation of these peptide antigens. New informatics approaches and databases have shed light on the extent of peptide antigens derived from unconventional sources including peptides derived from transcripts associated with frame shifts, long noncoding RNA, incorrectly annotated untranslated regions, post-translational modifications, and proteasomal splicing. Several challenges remain in successful analysis of immunopeptides, yet recent developments point to unexplored biology waiting to be unravelled.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intestinal Microbiota - An Unmissable Bridge to Severe Acute Pancreatitis-Associated Acute Lung Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35774796/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), one of the most serious abdominal emergencies in general surgery, is characterized by acute and rapid onset as well as high mortality, which often leads to multiple organ failure (MOF). Acute lung injury (ALI), the earliest accompanied organ dysfunction, is the most common cause of death in patients following the SAP onset. The exact pathogenesis of ALI during SAP, however, remains unclear. In recent years, advances in the microbiota-gut-lung axis have led to a better understanding of SAP-associated lung injury (PALI). In addition, the bidirectional communications between intestinal microbes and the lung are becoming more apparent. This paper aims to review the mechanisms of an imbalanced intestinal microbiota contributing to the development of PALI, which is mediated by the disruption of physical, chemical, and immune barriers in the intestine, promotes bacterial translocation, and results in the activation of abnormal immune responses in severe pancreatitis. The pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) mediated immunol mechanisms in the occurrence of PALI via binding with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) through the microbiota-gut-lung axis are focused in this study. Moreover, the potential therapeutic strategies for alleviating PALI by regulating the composition or the function of the intestinal microbiota are discussed in this review. The aim of this study is to provide new ideas and therapeutic tools for PALI patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fatal Circle of NETs and NET-Associated DAMPs Contributing to Organ Dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35741047/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens or sterile injuries. Pattern recognition receptors (PRR) sense molecules released from inflamed or damaged cells, or foreign molecules resulting from invading pathogens. PRRs can in turn induce inflammatory responses, comprising the generation of cytokines or chemokines, which further induce immune cell recruitment. Neutrophils represent an essential factor in the early immune response and fulfill numerous tasks to fight infection or heal injuries. The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is part of it and was originally attributed to the capture and elimination of pathogens. In the last decade studies revealed a detrimental role of NETs during several diseases, often correlated with an exaggerated immune response. Overwhelming inflammation in single organs can induce remote organ damage, thereby further perpetuating release of inflammatory molecules. Here, we review recent findings regarding damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which are able to induce NET formation, as well as NET components known to act as DAMPs, generating a putative fatal circle of inflammation contributing to organ damage and sequentially occurring remote organ injury.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can regulate the polarization of macrophages in a variety of inflammatory diseases by mediating intercellular signal transduction and affecting the occurrence and development of diseases. After macrophages are regulated by EVs, they mainly show two phenotypes: the proinflammatory M1 type and the anti-inflammatory M2 type. A large number of studies have shown that in diseases such as mastitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Acute lung injury, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, EVs promote the progression of the disease by inducing the M1-like polarization of macrophages. In diseases such as liver injury, asthma, and myocardial infarction, EVs can induce M2-like polarization of macrophages, inhibit the inflammatory response, and reduce the severity of the disease, thus indicating new pathways for treating inflammatory diseases. The EV/macrophage axis has become a potential target for inflammatory disease pathogenesis and comprehensive treatment. This article reviews the structure and function of the EV/macrophage axis and summarizes its biological functions in inflammatory diseases to provide insights for the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Innate Immune Cell Death in Neuroinflammation and Alzheimer&#39;s Disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder molecularly characterized by the formation of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) plaques and type 2 microtubule-associated protein (Tau) abnormalities. Multiple studies have shown that many of the brain&amp;rsquo;s immunological cells, specifically microglia and astrocytes, are involved in AD pathogenesis. Cells of the innate immune system play an essential role in eliminating pathogens but also regulate brain homeostasis and AD. When activated, innate immune cells can cause programmed cell death through multiple pathways, including pyroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis, and PANoptosis. The cell death often results in the release of proinflammatory cytokines that propagate the innate immune response and can eliminate AÎ² plaques and aggregated Tau proteins. However, chronic neuroinflammation, which can result from cell death, has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and can worsen AD. Therefore, the innate immune response must be tightly balanced to appropriately clear these AD-related structural abnormalities without inducing chronic neuroinflammation. In this review, we discuss neuroinflammation, innate immune responses, inflammatory cell death pathways, and cytokine secretion as they relate to AD. Therapeutic strategies targeting these innate immune cell death mechanisms will be critical to consider for future preventive or palliative treatments for AD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of circular RNAs in pulmonary hypertension</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are endogenous, covalently circularised, non-protein-coding RNAs generated from back-splicing. Most circRNAs are very stable, highly conserved, and expressed in a tissue-, cell- and developmental stage-specific manner. circRNAs play a significant role in various biological processes, such as regulation of gene expression and protein translation via sponging of microRNAs and binding with RNA-binding proteins. circRNAs have become a topic of great interest in research due to their close link with the development of various diseases. Their high stability, conservation and abundance in body fluids make them promising biomarkers for many diseases. A growing body of evidence suggests that aberrant expression of circRNAs and their targets plays a crucial role in pulmonary vascular remodelling and pulmonary arterial hypertension (group 1) as well as other forms (groups 3 and 4) of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Here we discuss the roles and molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular remodelling and PH. We also highlight the therapeutic and biomarker potential of circRNAs in PH.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human temperature regulation under heat stress in health, disease, and injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35679471/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human body constantly exchanges heat with the environment. Temperature regulation is a homeostatic feedback control system that ensures deep body temperature is maintained within narrow limits despite wide variations in environmental conditions and activity-related elevations in metabolic heat production. Extensive research has been performed to study the physiological regulation of deep body temperature. This review focuses on healthy and disordered human temperature regulation during heat stress. Central to this discussion is the notion that various morphological features, intrinsic factors, diseases, and injuries independently and interactively influence deep body temperature during exercise and/or exposure to hot ambient temperatures. The first sections review fundamental aspects of the human heat stress response, including the biophysical principles governing heat balance and the autonomic control of heat loss thermoeffectors. Next, we discuss the effects of different intrinsic factors (morphology, heat adaptation, biological sex, and age), diseases (neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and genetic), and injuries (spinal cord injury, deep burns, and heat stroke), with emphasis on the mechanisms by which these factors enhance or disturb the regulation of deep body temperature during heat stress. We conclude with key unanswered questions in this field of research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the American Gastroenterological Association&amp;rsquo;s Center for GI Innovation and Technology convened a consensus conference, entitled &amp;ldquo;Colorectal Cancer Screening and Surveillance: Role of Emerging Technology and Innovation to Improve Outcomes.&amp;rdquo; The conference participants, which included more than 60 experts in colorectal cancer, considered recent improvements in colorectal cancer screening rates and polyp detection, persistent barriers to colonoscopy uptake, and opportunities for performance improvement and innovation. This white paper originates from that conference. It aims to summarize current patient- and physician-centered gaps and challenges in colonoscopy, diagnostic and therapeutic challenges affecting colonoscopy uptake, and the potential use of emerging technologies and quality metrics to improve patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comprehensive insight into endothelial progenitor cell-derived extracellular vesicles as a promising candidate for disease treatment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35672766/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are a type of stem cell, have been found to have strong angiogenic and tissue repair capabilities. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain many effective components, such as cellular proteins, microRNAs, messenger RNAs, and long noncoding RNAs, and can be secreted by different cell types. The functions of EVs depend mainly on their parent cells. Many researchers have conducted functional studies of EPC-derived EVs (EPC-EVs) and showed that they exhibit therapeutic effects on many diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, acute kidney injury, acute lung injury, and sepsis. In this review article, we comprehensively summarized the biogenesis and functions of EPCs and EVs and the potent role of EPC-EVs in the treatment of various diseases. Furthermore, the current problems and future prospects have been discussed, and further studies are needed to compare the therapeutic effects of EVs derived from various stem cells, which will contribute to the accelerated translation of these applications in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel drug delivery systems and disease models for pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35636615/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a serious and progressive lung disease which is possibly life-threatening. It causes lung scarring and affects lung functions including epithelial cell injury, massive recruitment of immune cells and abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). There is currently no cure for PF. Treatment for PF is aimed at slowing the course of the disease and relieving symptoms. Pirfenidone (PFD) and nintedanib (NDNB) are currently the only two FDA-approved oral medicines to slow down the progress of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a specific type of PF. Novel drug delivery systems and therapies have been developed to improve the prognosis of the disease, as well as reduce or minimize the toxicities during drug treatment. The drug delivery routes for these therapies are various including oral, intravenous, nasal, inhalant, intratracheal and transdermal; although this is dependent on specific treatment mechanisms. In addition, researchers have also expanded current animal models that could not fully restore the clinicopathology, and developed a series of in vitro models such as organoids to study the pathogenesis and treatment of PF. This review describes recent advances on pathogenesis exploration, classifies and specifies the progress of drug delivery systems by their delivery routes, as well as an overview on the in vitro and in vivo models for PF research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circular RNA: An emerging frontier in RNA therapeutic targets, RNA therapeutics, and mRNA vaccines</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35649485/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNA) is a class of natural (biogenic) or synthetic closed RNA without 5&amp;rsquo; or 3&amp;rsquo; ends. Meanwhile, their unique covalently-closed structures of circRNA prevent RNA degradation by exonucleases, thereby empowering them with high pharmaceutical stability and biostability relative to current standard-of-care linear mRNA. Natural circRNA can be non-coding RNAs as well as protein-coding RNA, the latter of which was recently discovered. The physiological functions of biogenic circRNAs, which largely remain elusive, include protein and gene sponges, cell activity modulators, and protein translation. The discovery that the circRNA levels can be correlated with some human diseases empowers circRNA with the potential as a novel type of disease biomarkers and a noncanonical class of therapeutic targets. Recently, synthetic circRNA have been engineered to explore their applications as a novel class of mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of the biogenesis and physiological functions of natural circRNAs, the approaches to circRNA synthesis, and current research in the exploration of endogenous circRNAs as novel therapeutic targets and testing circRNAs as an emerging class of RNA therapeutics and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel Drug Delivery Technologies and Targets for Renal Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35652363/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burden of acute and chronic kidney diseases to the health care system is exacerbated by the high mortality that this disease carries paired with the still limited availability of comprehensive therapies. A reason partially resides in the complexity of the kidney, with multiple potential target cell types and a complex structural environment that complicate strategies to protect and recover renal function after injury. Management of both acute and chronic renal disease, irrespective of the cause, are mainly focused on supportive treatments and renal replacement strategies when needed. Emerging preclinical evidence supports the feasibility of drug delivery technology for the kidney, and recent studies have contributed to building a robust catalog of peptides, proteins, nanoparticles, liposomes, extracellular vesicles, and other carriers that may be fused to therapeutic peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, or small molecule drugs. These fusions can display a precise renal uptake, an enhanced circulating time, and a directed intraorgan biodistribution while protecting their cargo to improve therapeutic efficacy. However, several hurdles that slow the transition towards clinical applications are still in the way, such as solubility, toxicity, and sub-optimal renal targeting. This review will discuss the feasibility and current limitations of drug delivery technologies for the treatment of renal disease, offering an update on their potential and the future directions of these promising strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Implications of Hyperoxia over the Tumor Microenvironment: An Overview Highlighting the Importance of the Immune System</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35681719/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperoxia is used in order to counteract hypoxia effects in the TME (tumor microenvironment), which are described to boost the malignant tumor phenotype and poor prognosis. The reduction of tumor hypoxic state through the formation of a non-aberrant vasculature or an increase in the toxicity of the therapeutic agent improves the efficacy of therapies such as chemotherapy. Radiotherapy efficacy has also improved, where apoptotic mechanisms seem to be implicated. Moreover, hyperoxia increases the antitumor immunity through diverse pathways, leading to an immunopermissive TME. Although hyperoxia is an approved treatment for preventing and treating hypoxemia, it has harmful side-effects. Prolonged exposure to high oxygen levels may cause acute lung injury, characterized by an exacerbated immune response, and the destruction of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Furthermore, under this situation, the high concentration of ROS may cause toxicity that will lead not only to cell death but also to an increase in chemoattractant and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. This would end in a lung leukocyte recruitment and, therefore, lung damage. Moreover, unregulated inflammation causes different consequences promoting tumor development and metastasis. This process is known as protumor inflammation, where different cell types and molecules are implicated; for instance, IL-1Î² has been described as a key cytokine. Although current results show benefits over cancer therapies using hyperoxia, further studies need to be conducted, not only to improve tumor regression, but also to prevent its collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coevolution of vertebrate and mammalian hosts with DNA viruses has driven the ability of host cells to distinguish viral from cellular DNA in the nucleus to induce intrinsic immune responses. Concomitant viral mechanisms have arisen to inhibit DNA sensing. At this virus-host interface, emerging evidence links cytokine responses and cellular homeostasis pathways, particularly the DNA damage response (DDR). Nuclear DNA sensors, such as the interferon (IFN)-Î³ inducible protein 16 (IFI16), functionally intersect with the DDR regulators ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Here, we discuss accumulating knowledge for the DDR-innate immunity signaling axis. Through the lens of this infection-driven signaling axis, we present host and viral molecular strategies acquired to regulate autoinflammation and antiviral responses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumonia and its sequelae, acute lung injury, present unique challenges for pulmonary and critical care healthcare professionals, and these challenges have recently garnered global attention due to the ongoing Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. One limitation to translational investigation of acute lung injury, including its most severe manifestation (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) has been heterogeneity resulting from the clinical and physiologic diagnosis that represents a wide variety of etiologies. Recent efforts have improved our understanding and approach to heterogeneity by defining sub-phenotypes of ARDS although significant gaps in knowledge remain. Improving our mechanistic understanding of acute lung injury and its most common cause, infectious pneumonia, can advance our approach to precision targeted clinical interventions. Here, we review the pathogenesis of pneumonia and acute lung injury, including how respiratory infections and lung injury disrupt lung homoeostasis, and provide an overview of respiratory microbial pathogenesis, the lung microbiome, and interventions that have been demonstrated to improve outcomes-or not-in human clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are formed in all domains of life and via different mechanisms. There has been an explosion in the number of circRNA papers in recent years; however, as a relatively young field, circRNA biology has an urgent need for common experimental standards for isolating, analyzing, expressing and depleting circRNAs. Here we propose a set of guidelines for circRNA studies based on the authors&amp;rsquo; experience. This Perspective will specifically address the major class of circRNAs in Eukarya that are generated by a spliceosome-catalyzed back-splicing event. We hope that the implementation of best practice principles for circRNA research will help move the field forward and allow a better functional understanding of this fascinating group of RNAs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent advance of RNA aptamers and DNAzymes for MicroRNA detection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35671695/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MiRNAs are considered to be promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for disease diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SELEX technology could select and design functional nucleic acids (FNA) toward targets of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FNA nanostructures have the advantages of high stability, specificity, and activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FNA can be functionalized and generate various types of detection signals for miRNA detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application of RNA aptamers and DNAzymes in the construction of biosensors for miRNA detection is clearly discussed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, single-stranded, and non-coding RNA molecules that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, participating in the regulation of a variety of important biological activities. Accumulating evidence suggests that miRNAs are closely related to many major human diseases, especially cancer, and they are considered to be highly promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for disease diagnosis and treatment. To this end, the development of highly accurate, selective, and sensitive strategies for miRNA detection is essential for realizing the early diagnosis of diseases and improving the success rate of treatment. Over the past decade, functional nucleic acid nanostructures have emerged as powerful tools for detecting disease-related miRNAs because of their unique advantages, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, high stability, specificity, and activity. Particularly, thanks to the rapid advancement of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) technology, it is now feasible to strictly select and reasonably design functional nucleic acids with high specificity and activity toward targets of interest, and thereby enhance the performance of miRNA detection. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the application of functional nucleic acids including RNA aptamers and DNAzymes selected by SELEX in the construction of biosensors for miRNA detection in recent years. We also provide insights into the impact of the advantages of RNA aptamers and DNAzymes on the enhancement of the performance of miRNA biosensors. We hope this review will serve as a valuable foundation to inspire more exciting research in this emerging field in near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion of the biology of the alarmin cytokine IL-33, a member of the IL-1 family with critical roles in type 2 and type 1 immunity and regulatory responses, and allergic and non-allergic inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review of the expression of IL-33 in tissue-derived cells (endothelial cells, epithelial cells and stromal cells), its rapid release upon tissue injury or cellular damage, and its processing into highly active forms by inflammatory and allergen proteases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion of the problems of specificity of IL-33 reagents, critical review of the recent literature and highlights of results validated using IL-33-deficient cells as controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendations for generating reliable results by including appropriate specificity controls early in a project in each experimental system and model analyzed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review of the genetic and environmental regulation of IL-33 in asthma, and results of clinical trials with anti-IL-33 antibodies for therapy of asthma and COPD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a member of the IL-1 family, is an alarmin cytokine with crucial roles in tissue homeostasis and repair, type 2 immunity, allergic and non-allergic inflammation, viral infection, and cancer. IL-33 is abundant in the nuclei of tissue-derived cells, including endothelial cells from blood vessels, epithelial cells from barrier tissues, and fibroblastic stromal cells from various tissues. IL-33 is released upon cell damage or tissue injury and activates Myd88-dependent signaling pathways in cells expressing the ST2 (IL-1RL1) receptor. Analysis of patient samples and studies in murine models support an important role of IL-33/ST2 signaling in allergic inflammation in different tissues (lung, nasopharynx, skin) and diseases (asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis). IL33 and IL1RL1/ST2 are among the most highly replicated susceptibility loci for asthma. However, the IL-33/ST2 pathway is also important in non-allergic inflammation. Indeed, targets of IL-33 include immune cells involved in both type 2 and type 1 immunity and regulatory responses, such as group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), mast cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), Th2 cells, basophils, eosinophils, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, Th1 cells, CD8 T cells, NK and iNKT cells. In the main part of this review, we discuss the basic biology of the IL-33 protein (molecular characteristics, nuclear localization, cellular sources in vivo), and its mechanisms of release, and bioactive forms in various contexts. Importantly, we alert the scientific community to the problems of specificity of IL-33 reagents, we explain why studies without specificity controls with IL-33-deficient cells are misleading to the field and lead to unnecessary controversy, and we make recommendations to generate reliable results. In the final part, we review the genetic and environmental regulation of IL-33 in allergic airway inflammation and asthma, and we highlight recent studies showing clinical efficacy of anti-IL-33 antibodies in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting ferroptosis as a vulnerability in cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death that is triggered by the toxic build-up of lipid peroxides on cellular membranes. In recent years, ferroptosis has garnered enormous interest in cancer research communities, partly because it is a unique cell death modality that is mechanistically and morphologically different from other forms of cell death, such as apoptosis, and therefore holds great potential for cancer therapy. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of ferroptosis-inducing and ferroptosis defence mechanisms, dissect the roles and mechanisms of ferroptosis in tumour suppression and tumour immunity, conceptualize the diverse vulnerabilities of cancer cells to ferroptosis, and explore therapeutic strategies for targeting ferroptosis in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cell death and ischemia-reperfusion injury in lung transplantation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35710485/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung transplantation is the most effective therapy for patients with end-stage lung disease. However, concern of donor lung damage and ischemia-reperfusion induced lung injury limits the use of &amp;ldquo;marginal&amp;rdquo; donor lungs. Recent transcriptomic studies have demonstrated that the enrichment of gene-clusters related to cell death and inflammation are the most profound signals during ischemia-reperfusion in human lung transplants. Herein, we focus on the relationship between inflammation and programmed cell death, especially necroptosis, mitochondrial permeability transition-initiated regulated necrosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagic cell death. Cell death-related molecules have been tested as potential biomarkers for donor lung assessment. Inhibitors for various types of cell death have been explored as therapeutics for ischemia reperfusion injury in lung transplantation. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms may help to improve donor management, organ preservation, prevention and treatment of primary graft dysfunction during and post transplantation. Moreover, evaluation and treatment of cell death and inflammation during ex vivo lung perfusion may be a game changer in donor organ management, assessment, repair, and reconditioning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human organoids in basic research and clinical applications</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35610212/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organoids are three-dimensional (3D) miniature structures cultured in vitro produced from either human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) or adult stem cells (AdSCs) derived from healthy individuals or patients that recapitulate the cellular heterogeneity, structure, and functions of human organs. The advent of human 3D organoid systems is now possible to allow remarkably detailed observation of stem cell morphogens, maintenance and differentiation resemble primary tissues, enhancing the potential to study both human physiology and developmental stage. As they are similar to their original organs and carry human genetic information, organoids derived from patient hold great promise for biomedical research and preclinical drug testing and is currently used for personalized, regenerative medicine, gene repair and transplantation therapy. In recent decades, researchers have succeeded in generating various types of organoids mimicking in vivo organs. Herein, we provide an update on current in vitro differentiation technologies of brain, retinal, kidney, liver, lung, gastrointestinal, cardiac, vascularized and multi-lineage organoids, discuss the differences between PSC- and AdSC-derived organoids, summarize the potential applications of stem cell-derived organoids systems in the laboratory and clinic, and outline the current challenges for the application of organoids, which would deepen the understanding of mechanisms of human development and enhance further utility of organoids in basic research and clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insights gained in the pathology of lung disease through single-cell transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35608561/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human lung is a relatively quiescent organ in the normal healthy state but contains stem/progenitor cells that contribute to normal tissue maintenance and either repair or remodeling in response to injury and disease. Maintenance or repair lead to proper restoration of functional lung tissue and maintenance of physiological functions, with remodeling resulting in altered structure and function that is typically associated with disease. Knowledge of cell types contributing to lung tissue maintenance and repair/remodeling have largely relied on mouse models of injury-repair and lineage tracing of local progenitors. Therefore, many of the functional alterations underlying remodeling in human lung disease have remained poorly defined. However, the advent of advanced genomics approaches to define the molecular phenotype of lung cells at single-cell resolution has paved the way for rapid advances in our understanding of cell types present within the normal human lung and changes that accompany disease. Here we summarize recent advances in our understanding of disease-related changes in the molecular phenotype of human lung epithelium that have emerged from single-cell transcriptomic studies. We focus attention on emerging concepts of epithelial transitional states that characterize the pathological remodeling that accompanies chronic lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. Concepts arising from these studies are actively evolving and require corroborative studies to improve our understanding of disease mechanisms. Whenever possible, we highlight opportunities for providing a unified nomenclature in this rapidly advancing field of research.

      <title>Perspectives of using microRNA-loaded nanocarriers for epigenetic reprogramming of drug resistant colorectal cancers</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35623562/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic regulation by microRNAs (miRs) demonstrated a promising therapeutic potential of these molecules to regulate genetic activity in different cancers, including colorectal cancers (CRCs). The RNA-based therapy does not change genetic codes in tumor cells but can silence oncogenes and/or reactivate inhibited tumor suppressor genes. In many cancers, specific miRs were shown to promote or stop tumor progression. Among confirmed and powerful epigenetic regulators of colon carcinogenesis and development of resistance are onco-miRs, which include let-7, miR-21, miR-22, miR-23a, miR-27a, miR-34, miR-92, miR-96, miR-125b, miR-135b, miR-182, miR-200c, miR-203, miR-221, miR-421, miR-451, and others. Moreover, various tumor-suppressor miRs (miR-15b-5b, miR-18a, miR-20b, miR-22, miR-96, miR-139-5p, miR-145, miR-149, miR-197, miR-199b, miR-203, miR-214, miR-218, miR-320, miR-375-3p, miR-409-3p, miR-450b-5p, miR-494, miR-577, miR-874, and others) were found silenced in drug-resistant CRCs. Re-expression of tumor suppressor miR is complicated by the chemical nature of miRs that are not long-lasting compounds and require protection from the enzymatic degradation. Several recent studies explored application of miRs using nanocarrier complexes. This study critically describes the most successfully tested nanoparticle complexes used for intracellular delivery of nuclear acids and miRs, including micelles, liposomes, inorganic and polymeric NPs, dendrimers, and aptamers. Nanocarriers shield incorporated miRs and improve the agent stability in circulation. Attachment of antibodies and/or specific peptide or ligands facilitates cell-targeted miR delivery. Addressing in vivo challenges, a broad spectrum of non-toxic materials has been tested and indicated reliable advantages of lipid-based (lipoplexes) and polymer-based liposomes. Recent cutting-edge developments indicated that lipid-based complexes with multiple cargo, including several miRs, are the most effective approach to eradicate drug-resistant tumors. Focusing on CRC-specific miRs, this review provides a guidance and insights towards the most promising direction to achieve dramatic reduction in tumor growth and metastasis using miR-nanocarrier complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Primary Graft Dysfunction: The Role of Aging in Lung Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35686120/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transplant centers around the world have been using extended criteria donors to remedy the ongoing demand for lung transplantation. With a rapidly aging population, older donors are increasingly considered. Donor age, at the same time has been linked to higher rates of lung ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). This process of acute, sterile inflammation occurring upon reperfusion is a key driver of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) leading to inferior short- and long-term survival. Understanding and improving the condition of older lungs is thus critical to optimize outcomes. Notably, &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; lung perfusion (EVLP) seems to have the potential of reconditioning ischemic lungs through &lt;em&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/em&gt; perfusing and ventilation. Here, we aim to delineate mechanisms driving lung IRI and review both experimental and clinical data on the effects of aging in augmenting the consequences of IRI and PGD in lung transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although vaping has recently increased as a mode of inhaling marijuana and has been associated with numerous and sometimes fatal cases of acute severe lung injury, smoking remains the most common method of inhaling marijuana and has been studied more extensively. Smoking marijuana has been shown to produce modest but significant short-term bronchodilation both in healthy subjects and in those with asthma. Long-term effects of habitual marijuana smoking include the following: (1) symptoms of chronic bronchitis (increased cough, sputum production, and wheezing); (2) modest effects on lung function in cross-sectional studies (no significant decrease in FEV1 but mild reductions in FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio, an increase in forced vital capacity and other lung volumes, reductions in specific airway conductance, and variable effects of maximal midexpiratory flow rates and diffusing capacity); and (3) variable effects on age-related decline in FEV1 in longitudinal studies. Most cohort and case-control studies have failed to show that marijuana smoking is a significant risk factor for lung cancer despite the presence of procarcinogenic components in marijuana smoke, although further study is warranted. The question whether marijuana smoking is associated with asthma is unclear and requires further investigation. Although delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, the principal psychoactive component of marijuana, has immunomodulatory properties that hypothetically could increase the risk of pneumonia, the few available studies in marijuana smokers have failed to find an increased risk of pneumonia in immunocompetent users, although effects in immunosuppressed individuals have been variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apelin is widely distributed in the central nervous system and diverse organs in human and animals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The apelin/APJ system has important anti-inflammatory effects and is involved in regulating inflammation-related diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apelin-APJ signaling could inhibit inflammation, oxidative stress and ameliorate CNS and organ injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apelin/APJ system might become a novel promising therapeutic target for various diseases through anti-inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apelin, an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor (APJ), is widely distributed within the central nervous system and diverse organs in human and animals. Recent studies indicate that the apelin/APJ system plays an important role in physiological and pathophysiological situations. Apelin/APJ could inhibit inflammatory response by down-regulation of the nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) pathway and by up-regulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathway etc. Basic and preliminary research demonstrated that apelin/APJ system was involved in multiple diseases such as cardiovascular system diseases, liver and kidney diseases, neurological diseases, inflammatory intestinal diseases, pancreatitis, lung injury, aging, and obesity. Further, deficiency or overabundance of apelin can aggravate disease states in that inflammation is not only an important physiologic defense mechanism but also a potential mediator of organ damage. In this review, we summarize recent apelin/APJ system research progress with emphasis on the influence of the system on inflammation. Further, the mechanistic basis by which apelin regulates various inflammation-related diseases is analyzed. Finally, apelin and APJ might be presented as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of diseases mediated or exacerbated by inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evolving Concepts in Endothelial Pathobiology of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35582968/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a deadly disease, characterized by increased vascular resistance, pulmonary arteriolar loss, and occlusive arterial remodeling, leading to eventual right heart failure. Evidence increasingly points to the pulmonary endothelium as a central actor in PAH. Endothelial cell apoptosis can result directly in distal lung arteriolar pruning and indirectly in the formation of complex and occlusive arterial lesions, reflecting an imbalance between endothelial injury and repair in the development and progression of PAH. Many of the mutations implicated in PAH are in genes, which are predominantly, or solely, expressed in endothelial cells, and the endothelium is a major target for therapeutic interventions to restore BMP signaling. We explore how arterial pruning can promote the emergence of occlusive arterial remodeling mediated by ongoing endothelial injury secondary to hemodynamic perturbation and pathological increases in luminal shear stress. The emerging role of endothelial cell senescence is discussed in the transition from reversible to irreversible arterial remodeling in advanced PAH, and we review the sometimes conflicting evidence that female sex hormones can both protect or promote vascular changes in disease. Finally, we explore the contribution of the endothelium to metabolic changes and the altered inflammatory and immune state in the PAH lung, focusing on the role of excessive TGFÎ² signaling. Given the complexity of the endothelial pathobiology of PAH, we anticipate that emerging technologies that allow the study of molecular events at a single cell level will provide answers to many of the questions raised in this review.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NADPH oxidase family proteins: signaling dynamics to disease management</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are pervasive signaling molecules in biological systems. In humans, a lack of ROS causes chronic and extreme bacterial infections, while uncontrolled release of these factors causes pathologies due to excessive inflammation. Professional phagocytes such as neutrophils (PMNs), eosinophils, monocytes, and macrophages use superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase (NOX) as part of their arsenal of antimicrobial mechanisms to produce high levels of ROS. NOX is a multisubunit enzyme complex composed of five essential subunits, two of which are localized in the membrane, while three are localized in the cytosol. In resting phagocytes, the oxidase complex is unassembled and inactive; however, it becomes activated after cytosolic components translocate to the membrane and are assembled into a functional oxidase. The NOX isoforms play a variety of roles in cellular differentiation, development, proliferation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal control, migration, and contraction. Recent studies have identified NOX as a major contributor to disease pathologies, resulting in a shift in focus on inhibiting the formation of potentially harmful free radicals. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and the transduction pathways involved in NOX-mediated signaling is essential for the development of new therapeutic agents that minimize the hyperproduction of ROS. The current review provides a thorough overview of the various NOX enzymes and their roles in disease pathophysiology, highlights pharmacological strategies, and discusses the importance of computational modeling for future NOX-related studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Involvement of Alarmins in the Pathogenesis of SjÃ¶grenâ€™s Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35628481/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SjÃ¶gren&amp;rsquo;s syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects exocrine glands, primarily the salivary and lachrymal glands. It is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the glandular tissues, ultimately leading to their dysfunction and destruction. Besides classic dry eyes and dry mouth defined as sicca syndrome, patients affected by the disease also typically display symptoms such as fatigue, pain and in more than 50% of cases, systemic manifestations such as arthritis, interstitial lung involvement, neurological involvement and an increased risk of lymphoma. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SS still remain elusive. The crucial role of innate immunity has been advocated in recent years regarding the pathogenesis of pSS, especially in the initiation and progression toward autoimmunity. Alarmins are endogenous molecules that belong to the large family of damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Alarmins are rapidly released, ensuing cell injury and interacting with pattern recognition receptors (PRR) such as toll-like receptors (TLR) to recruit and activate cells of the innate immune system and to promote adaptive immunity responses. This review highlights the current knowledge of various alarmins and their role in the pathogenesis of pSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most circular RNAs are produced from the back-splicing of exons of precursor mRNAs. Recent technological advances have in part overcome problems with their circular conformation and sequence overlap with linear cognate mRNAs, allowing a better understanding of their cellular roles. Depending on their localization and specific interactions with DNA, RNA, and proteins, circular RNAs can modulate transcription and splicing, regulate stability and translation of cytoplasmic mRNAs, interfere with signaling pathways, and serve as templates for translation in different biological and pathophysiological contexts. Emerging applications of RNA circles to interfere with cellular processes, modulate immune responses, and direct translation into proteins shed new light on biomedical research. In this review, we discuss approaches used in circular RNA studies and the current understanding of their regulatory roles and potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurons are highly interwoven to form intricate neural circuits that underlie the diverse functions of the brain. Dissecting the anatomical organization of neural circuits is key to deciphering how the brain processes information, produces thoughts, and instructs behaviors. Over the past decades, recombinant viral vectors have become the most commonly used tracing tools to define circuit architecture. In this review, we introduce the current categories of viral tools and their proper application in circuit tracing. We further discuss some advances in viral tracing strategy and prospective innovations of viral tools for future study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an overactivated inflammatory response caused by direct or indirect injuries that destroy lung parenchymal cells and dramatically reduce lung function. Although some research progress has been made in recent years, the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS remains unclear due to its heterogeneity and etiology. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a type of small noncoding RNA, play a vital role in various diseases. In ALI/ARDS, miRNAs can regulate inflammatory and immune responses by targeting specific molecules. Regulation of miRNA expression can reduce damage and promote the recovery of ALI/ARDS. Consequently, miRNAs are considered as potential diagnostic indicators and therapeutic targets of ALI/ARDS. Given that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS, we review the miRNAs involved in the inflammatory process of ALI/ARDS to provide new ideas for the pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis, and treatment of ALI/ARDS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plasma-Enabled Smart Nanoexosome Platform as Emerging Immunopathogenesis for Clinical Viral Infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35631640/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart nanoexosomes are nanosized structures enclosed in lipid bilayers that are structurally similar to the viruses released by a variety of cells, including the cells lining the respiratory system. Of particular importance, the interaction between smart nanoexosomes and viruses can be used to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines. It is possible that nanoexosomes will be utilized and antibodies will be acquired more successfully for the transmission of an immune response if reconvalescent plasma (CP) is used instead of reconvalescent plasma exosomes (CPExo) in this concept. Convalescent plasma contains billions of smart nanoexosomes capable of transporting a variety of molecules, including proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA among other viral infections. Smart nanoexosomes are released from virus-infected cells and play an important role in mediating communication between infected and uninfected cells. Infections use the formation, production and release of smart nanoexosomes to enhance the infection, transmission and intercellular diffusion of viruses. Cell-free smart nanoexosomes produced by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could also be used as cell-free therapies in certain cases. Smart nanoexosomes produced by mesenchymal stem cells can also promote mitochondrial function and heal lung injury. They can reduce cytokine storms and restore the suppression of host antiviral defenses weakened by viral infections. This study examines the benefits of smart nanoexosomes and their roles in viral transmission, infection, treatment, drug delivery and clinical applications. We also explore some potential future applications for smart nanoexosomes in the treatment of viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor-Derived Lactate Creates a Favorable Niche for Tumor via Supplying Energy Source for Tumor and Modulating the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35646923/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor evolution is influenced by events involving tumor cells and the environment in which they live, known as the tumor microenvironment (TME). TME is a functional and structural niche composed of tumor cells, endothelial cells (ECs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), and a subset of immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, T cells, B cells). Otto Warburg revealed the Warburg effect in 1923, a characteristic metabolic mechanism of tumor cells that performs high glucose uptake and excessive lactate formation even in abundant oxygen. Tumor tissues excrete a large amount of lactate into the extracellular microenvironment in response to TME&amp;rsquo;s hypoxic or semi-hypoxic state. High lactate concentrations in tumor biopsies have been linked to metastasis and poor clinical outcome. This indicates that the metabolite may play a role in carcinogenesis and lead to immune escape in TME. Lactate is now recognized as an essential carbon source for cellular metabolism and as a signaling molecule in TME, forming an active niche that influences tumor progression. This review summarized the advanced literature demonstrating the functional role of lactate in TME remodeling, elucidating how lactate shapes the behavior and the phenotype of both tumor cells and tumor-associated cells. We also concluded the intriguing interactions of multiple immune cells in TME. Additionally, we demonstrated how lactate functioned as a novel function factor by being used in a new histone modification, histone lysine lactylation, and to regulate gene expression in TME. Ultimately, because lactate created a favorable niche for tumor progression, we summarized potential anti-tumor strategies targeting lactate metabolism and signaling to investigate better cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEAD/H-box proteins are the largest family of RNA helicases in mammalian genomes, and they are present in all kingdoms of life. Since their discovery in the late 1980s, DEAD/H-box family proteins have been a major focus of study. They have been found to play central roles in RNA metabolism, gene expression, signal transduction, programmed cell death, and the immune response to bacterial and viral infections. Aberrant functions of DEAD/H-box proteins have been implicated in a wide range of human diseases that include cancer, neurodegeneration, and inherited genetic disorders. In this review, we provide a historical context and discuss the molecular functions of DEAD/H-box proteins, highlighting the recent discoveries linking their dysregulation to human diseases. We will also discuss the state of knowledge regarding two specific DEAD/H-box proteins that have critical roles in immune responses and programmed cell death, DDX3X and DDX58, also known as RIG-I. Given their importance in homeostasis and disease, an improved understanding of DEAD/H-box protein biology and protein-protein interactions will be critical for informing strategies to counteract the pathogenesis associated with several human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent advances in the rapid detection of microRNA with lateral flow assays</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35576723/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a kind of endogenous non-coding small molecule RNA, which are widely found in plants, animals, and viruses. miRNA can regulate the post-transcriptional cleavage of target message RNA or inhibit its translation process, and plays an important regulatory role in gene expression. Further studies have shown that miRNAs also play an important role in tumorigenesis and host-pathogen interactions. Given the important contribution of miRNAs in gene regulation and biological functions, rapid and accurate detection of miRNAs has become increasingly significant. Lateral flow assay is a detection method derived to achieve rapid detection in the field. It overcomes the problems of cumbersome, time-consuming, and high cost in traditional detection methods, and provides a good platform for accurate, sensitive, and immediate detection of target analytes. With the advantages convenient, cost-saving, and repaid result readout, the lateral flow test strips are now a recognized point-of-care testing (POCT) device and has been widely used in medical diagnosis, agriculture, food, and environmental safety. For the first time, we summarized the research progress of miRNA detection based on lateral flow methods, focusing on the strategies used in the lateral flow assays for miRNA detection and introducing some main experimental operation details, as well as providing an outlook on the future development direction of this field, aiming to provide a general guidance for colleagues preparing to conduct related research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive accumulation of hepatic lipids and metabolic stress-induced liver injury. There are currently no approved effective pharmacological treatments for NAFLD. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for centuries to treat patients with chronic liver diseases without clear disease types and mechanisms. More recently, TCM has been shown to have unique advantages in the treatment of NAFLD. We performed a systematic review of the medical literature published over the last two decades and found that many TCM formulas have been reported to be beneficial for the treatment of metabolic dysfunctions, including &lt;em&gt;Potentilla discolor&lt;/em&gt; Bunge (PDB). PDB has a variety of active compounds, including flavonoids, terpenoids, organic acids, steroids and tannins. Many compounds have been shown to exhibit a series of beneficial effects for the treatment of NAFLD, including anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory functions, improvement of lipid metabolism and reversal of insulin resistance. In this review, we summarize potential therapeutic effects of TCM formulas for the treatment of NAFLD, focusing on the medicinal properties of natural active compounds from PDB and their underlying mechanisms. We point out that PDB can be classified as a novel candidate for the treatment and prevention of NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulation of Carcinogenesis by Sensory Neurons and Neuromediators</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35565462/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system are crucial in maintaining homeostasis, and disturbances of these neuro-immune interactions may participate in carcinogenesis and metastasis. Nerve endings have been identified within solid tumors in humans and experimental animals. Although the involvement of the efferent sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation in carcinogenesis has been extensively investigated, the role of the afferent sensory neurons and the neuropeptides in tumor development, growth, and progression is recently appreciated. Similarly, current findings point to the significant role of Schwann cells as part of neuro-immune interactions. Hence, in this review, we mainly focus on local and systemic effects of sensory nerve activity as well as Schwann cells in carcinogenesis and metastasis. Specific denervation of vagal sensory nerve fibers, or vagotomy, in animal models, has been reported to markedly increase lung metastases of breast carcinoma as well as pancreatic and gastric tumor growth, with the formation of liver metastases demonstrating the protective role of vagal sensory fibers against cancer. Clinical studies have revealed that patients with gastric ulcers who have undergone a vagotomy have a greater risk of stomach, colorectal, biliary tract, and lung cancers. Protective effects of vagal activity have also been documented by epidemiological studies demonstrating that high vagal activity predicts longer survival rates in patients with colon, non-small cell lung, prostate, and breast cancers. However, several studies have reported that inhibition of sensory neuronal activity reduces the development of solid tumors, including prostate, gastric, pancreatic, head and neck, cervical, ovarian, and skin cancers. These contradictory findings are likely to be due to the post-nerve injury-induced activation of systemic sensory fibers, the level of aggressiveness of the tumor model used, and the local heterogeneity of sensory fibers. As the aggressiveness of the tumor model and the level of the inflammatory response increase, the protective role of sensory nerve fibers is apparent and might be mostly due to systemic alterations in the neuro-immune response. Hence, more insights into inductive and permissive mechanisms, such as systemic, cellular neuro-immunological mechanisms of carcinogenesis and metastasis formation, are needed to understand the role of sensory neurons in tumor growth and spread.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Challenges and directions in studying cell-cell communication by extracellular vesicles</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35260831/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication. They have important roles in numerous physiological and pathological processes, and show considerable promise as novel biomarkers of disease, as therapeutic agents and as drug delivery vehicles. Intriguingly, however, understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the many observed functions of EVs remains far from comprehensive, at least partly due to technical challenges in working with these small messengers. Here, we highlight areas of consensus as well as contentious issues in our understanding of the intracellular and intercellular journey of EVs: from biogenesis, release and dynamics in the extracellular space, to interaction with and uptake by recipient cells. We define knowledge gaps, identify key questions and challenges, and make recommendations on how to address these.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clinical implications of tristetraprolin (TTP) modulation in the treatment of inflammatory diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35525391/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abnormal regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine mediators can contribute to the excess inflammation characteristic of many autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease, type 1 diabetes, and many others. The tristetraprolin (TTP) family consists of a small group of related RNA-binding proteins that bind to preferred AU-rich binding sites within the 3&amp;rsquo;-untranslated regions of specific mRNAs to promote mRNA deadenylation and decay. TTP deficient mice develop a severe systemic inflammatory syndrome consisting of arthritis, myeloid hyperplasia, dermatitis, autoimmunity and cachexia, due at least in part to the excess accumulation of proinflammatory chemokine and cytokine mRNAs and their encoded proteins. To investigate the possibility that increased TTP expression or activity might have a beneficial effect on inflammatory diseases, at least two mouse models have been developed that provide proof of principle that increasing TTP activity can promote the decay of pro-inflammatory and other relevant transcripts, and decrease the severity of mouse models of inflammatory disease. Animal studies of this type are summarized here, and we briefly review the prospects for harnessing these insights for the development of TTP-based anti-inflammatory treatments in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selective Targeting of Cancer Cells by Copper Ionophores: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35309510/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional cancer therapies suffer from severe off-target effects because most of them target critical facets of cells that are generally shared by all rapidly proliferating cells. The development of new therapeutic agents should aim to increase selectivity and therefore reduce side effects. In addition, these agents should overcome cancer cell resistance and target cancer stem cells. Some copper ionophores have shown promise in this direction thanks to an intrinsic selectivity in preferentially inducing cuproptosis of cancer cells compared to normal cells. Here, Cu ionophores are discussed with a focus on selectivity towards cancer cells and on the mechanisms responsible for this selectivity. The proposed strategies, to further improve the targeting of cancer cells by copper ionophores, are also reported.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3D In Vitro Models: Novel Insights into Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Pathophysiology and Drug Screening</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35563831/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and often lethal interstitial lung disease of unknown aetiology. IPF is characterised by myofibroblast activation, tissue stiffening, and alveolar epithelium injury. As current IPF treatments fail to halt disease progression or induce regeneration, there is a pressing need for the development of novel therapeutic targets. In this regard, tri-dimensional (3D) models have rapidly emerged as powerful platforms for disease modelling, drug screening and discovery. In this review, we will touch on how 3D in vitro models such as hydrogels, precision-cut lung slices, and, more recently, lung organoids and lung-on-chip devices have been generated and/or modified to reveal distinct cellular and molecular signalling pathways activated during fibrotic processes. Markedly, we will address how these platforms could provide a better understanding of fibrosis pathophysiology and uncover effective treatment strategies for IPF patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circadian clock is the biochemical oscillator with a near 24-h period that is responsible for generating the circadian rhythms in peripheral organs including the lung. Mounting evidence suggests that circadian clock disruption during chronic lung diseases plays an essential role in augmented oxidative stress, inflammatory response, metabolic imbalances, hypoxia/hyperoxia, mucus secretion, dysregulated autophagy, and alters pulmonary function. Here, we review circadian clock disruption and discuss candidate clock genes that are altered at the transcriptional or translational level in chronic pulmonary diseases. This review aims to provide the current knowledge and understanding of the circadian molecular clock disruption in chronic pulmonary diseases which will further advance the development of novel clock-based therapeutics in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular mechanism of crosstalk between immune and metabolic systems in metabolic syndrome</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35490239/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is currently considered as a molecular basis of metabolic syndrome. Particularly, obesity-induced inflammation in adipose tissue is the origin of chronic inflammation of metabolic syndrome. Adipose tissue contains not only mature adipocytes with large lipid droplets, but also a variety of stromal cells including adipocyte precursors, vascular component cells, immune cells, and fibroblasts. However, crosstalk between those various cell types in adipose tissue in obesity still remains to be fully understood. We focus on two innate immune receptors, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle). We provided evidence that adipocyte-derived saturated fatty acids (SFAs) activate macrophage TLR4 signaling pathway, thereby forming a vicious cycle of inflammatory responses during the development of obesity. Intriguingly, the TLR4 signaling pathway is modulated metabolically and epigenetically: SFAs augment TLR4 signaling through the integrated stress response and chromatin remodeling, such as histone methylation, regulates dynamic transcription patterns downstream of TLR4 signaling. Another innate immune receptor Mincle senses cell death, which is a trigger of chronic inflammatory diseases including obesity. Macrophages form a histological structure termed &amp;ldquo;crown-like structure (CLS)&amp;rdquo;, in which macrophages surround dead adipocytes to engulf cell debris and residual lipids. Mincle is exclusively expressed in macrophages forming the CLS in obese adipose tissue and regulates adipocyte death-triggered adipose tissue fibrosis. In addition to adipose tissue, we found a structure similar to CLS in the liver of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the kidney after acute kidney injury. This review article highlights the recent progress of the crosstalk between immune and metabolic systems in metabolic syndrome, with a focus on innate immune receptors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&#39;s All in the PAN: Crosstalk, Plasticity, Redundancies, Switches, and Interconnectedness Encompassed by PANoptosis Underlying the Totality of Cell Death-Associated Biological Effects</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35563804/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against cellular perturbations. Innate immune activation elicits inflammatory programmed cell death in response to microbial infections or alterations in cellular homeostasis. Among the most well-characterized programmed cell death pathways are pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. While these pathways have historically been defined as segregated and independent processes, mounting evidence shows significant crosstalk among them. These molecular interactions have been described as &amp;lsquo;crosstalk&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;plasticity&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;redundancies&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;molecular switches&amp;rsquo;, and more. Here, we discuss the key components of cell death pathways and note several examples of crosstalk. We then explain how the diverse descriptions of crosstalk throughout the literature can be interpreted through the lens of an integrated inflammatory cell death concept, PANoptosis. The totality of biological effects in PANoptosis cannot be individually accounted for by pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis alone. We also discuss PANoptosomes, which are multifaceted macromolecular complexes that regulate PANoptosis. We consider the evidence for PANoptosis, which has been mechanistically characterized during influenza A virus, herpes simplex virus 1, Francisella novicida, and Yersinia infections, as well as in response to altered cellular homeostasis, in inflammatory diseases, and in cancers. We further discuss the role of IRF1 as an upstream regulator of PANoptosis and conclude by reexamining historical studies which lend credence to the PANoptosis concept. Cell death has been shown to play a critical role in infections, inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and more; therefore, having a holistic understanding of cell death is important for identifying new therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vimentin intermediate filaments, a type III intermediate filament, are among the most widely studied IFs and are found abundantly in mesenchymal cells. Vimentin intermediate filaments localize primarily in the cytoplasm but can also be found on the cell surface and extracellular space. The cytoplasmic vimentin is well-recognized for its role in providing mechanical strength and regulating cell migration, adhesion, and division. The post-translationally modified forms of Vimentin intermediate filaments have several implications in host-pathogen interactions, cancers, and non-malignant lung diseases. This review will analyze the role of vimentin beyond just the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker highlighting its role as a regulator of host-pathogen interactions and signaling pathways for the pathophysiology of various lung diseases. In addition, we will also examine the clinically relevant anti-vimentin compounds and antibodies that could potentially interfere with the pathogenic role of Vimentin intermediate filaments in lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Endotypes of Prematurity and Phenotypes of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia: Toward Personalized Neonatology</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35629108/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of prematurity, is increasingly recognized as the consequence of a pathological reparative response of the developing lung to both antenatal and postnatal injury. According to this view, the pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial and heterogeneous with different patterns of antenatal stress (endotypes) that combine with varying postnatal insults and might distinctively damage the development of airways, lung parenchyma, interstitium, lymphatic system, and pulmonary vasculature. This results in different clinical phenotypes of BPD. There is no clear consensus on which are the endotypes of prematurity but the combination of clinical information with placental and bacteriological data enables the identification of two main pathways leading to birth before 32 weeks of gestation: (1) infection/inflammation and (2) dysfunctional placentation. Regarding BPD phenotypes, the following have been proposed: parenchymal, peripheral airway, central airway, interstitial, congestive, vascular, and mixed phenotype. In line with the approach of personalized medicine, endotyping prematurity and phenotyping BPD will facilitate the design of more targeted therapeutic and prognostic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is an intracellular self-digestion mechanism, by which cellular components are sorted into double-membrane autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Cells use autophagy to dispose of wastes and eliminate hazards, while recycling nutrients and tuning metabolism in the process. Through these functions, autophagy promotes cell fitness, genome integrity, tissue homeostasis, and cell survival and growth under stress. Both autophagy upregulation and downregulation have been found in human cancers, suggesting a complex role in tumor development. Accumulating results from autophagy-deficient mice and mouse models of human cancers have demonstrated that autophagy generally suppresses tumor initiation, but promotes tumor progression, in a manner that is dependent on timing and context and modified by specific tumorigenic events. Given the role of autophagy in facilitating tumor growth, autophagy inhibition has gained wide attention as a potential anticancer therapy. Here, we summarize relevant genetic, preclinical, and clinical studies and discuss the multifaceted role of autophagy in cancer, as well as the prospects of autophagy inhibition for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assertion that a significant portion of the mammalian genome has not been translated and that non-coding RNA accounts for over half of polyadenylate RNA have received much attention. In recent years, increasing evidence proposes non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) as new regulators of various cellular processes, including cancer progression and nerve damage. Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death critical for homeostasis and tissue development. Cancer cells often have inhibited apoptotic pathways. It has recently been demonstrated that up/down-regulation of various lncRNAs in certain types of tumors shapes cancer cells&amp;rsquo; response to apoptotic stimuli. This review discusses the most recent studies on lncRNAs and apoptosis in healthy and cancer cells. In addition, the role of lncRNAs as novel targets for cancer therapy is reviewed here. Finally, since it has been shown that lncRNA expression is associated with specific types of cancer, the potential for using lncRNAs as biomarkers is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nrf2 overexpression prevents inflammation and apoptosis in I/R.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nrf2 upregulation improves cell viability in I/R.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a master regulator of redox balance and it responds to various cell stresses that oxidative stress is the most well-known one. The Nrf2 should undergo nuclear translocation to exert its protective impacts and decrease ROS production. On the other hand, ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a pathological event resulting from low blood flow to an organ and followed by reperfusion. The I/R induces cell injury and organ dysfunction. The present review focuses on Nrf2 function in alleviation of I/R injury. Stimulating of Nrf2 signaling ameliorates I/R injury in various organs including lung, liver, brain, testis and heart. The Nrf2 enhances activity of antioxidant enzymes to reduce ROS production and prevent oxidative stress-mediated cell death. Besides, Nrf2 reduces inflammation via decreasing levels of pro-inflammatory factors including IL-6, IL-1Î² and TNF-Î±. Nrf2 signaling is beneficial in preventing apoptosis and increasing cell viability. Nrf2 induces autophagy to prevent apoptosis during I/R injury. Furthermore, it can interact with other molecular pathways including PI3K/Akt, NF-ÎºB, miRNAs, lncRNAs and GSK-3Î² among others, to ameliorate I/R injury. The therapeutic agents, most of them are phytochemicals such as resveratrol, berberine and curcumin, induce Nrf2 signaling in I/R injury alleviation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeted Therapy for Inflammatory Diseases with Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Their Derived Exosomes: From Basic to Clinics</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35469174/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a beneficial and physiological process, but there are a number of inflammatory diseases which have detrimental effects on the body. In addition, the drugs used to treat inflammation have toxic side effects when used over a long period of time. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells that can be isolated from a variety of tissues and can be differentiate into diverse cell types under appropriate conditions. They also exhibit noteworthy anti-inflammatory properties, providing new options for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The therapeutic potential of MSCs is currently being investigated for various inflammatory diseases, such as kidney injury, lung injury, osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). MSCs can perform multiple functions, including immunomodulation, homing, and differentiation, to enable damaged tissues to form a balanced inflammatory and regenerative microenvironment under severe inflammatory conditions. In addition, accumulated evidence indicates that exosomes from extracellular vesicles of MSCs (MSC-Exos) play an extraordinary role, mainly by transferring their components to recipient cells. In this review, we summarize the mechanism and clinical trials of MSCs and MSC-Exos in various inflammatory diseases in detail, with a view to contributing to the treatment of MSCs and MSC-Exos in inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The pseudogenes of eukaryotic translation elongation factors (EEFs): Role in cancer and other human diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eukaryotic translation elongation factors (EEFs), i.e. &lt;em&gt;EEF1A1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EEF1A2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EEF1B2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EEF1D&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EEF1G&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EEF1E1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;EEF2&lt;/em&gt;, are coding-genes that play a central role in the elongation step of translation but are often altered in cancer. Less investigated are their pseudogenes. Recently, it was demonstrated that pseudogenes have a key regulatory role in the cell, especially via non-coding RNAs, and that the aberrant expression of ncRNAs has an important role in cancer development and progression. The present review paper, for the first time, collects all that published about the EEFs pseudogenes to create a base for future investigations. For most of them, the studies are in their infancy, while for others the studies suggest their involvement in normal cell physiology but also in various human diseases. However, more investigations are needed to understand their functions in both normal and cancer cells and to define which can be useful biomarkers or therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of Cellular Metabolism in the Formation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Airway Diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35493475/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a recently described mechanism of neutrophils that play an important role in health and disease. NETs are an innate defense mechanism that participate in clearance of pathogens, but they may also cause collateral damage in unrelated host tissues. Neutrophil dysregulation and NETosis occur in multiple lung diseases, such as pathogen-induced acute lung injury, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe asthma, cystic fibrosis, and recently, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. More recently, research into immunometabolism has surged due to the possibility of reprogramming metabolism in order to modulate immune functions. The present review analyzes the different metabolic pathways associated with NETs formation, and how these impact on pathologies of the airways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Specific expression and functions of circular RNAs</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35169296/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, circular RNAs (circRNAs), a new class of RNA molecules characterized by their covalently closed circular structure, have become a new research paradigm in RNA biology. Many circRNAs are conserved among eukaryotes, localize in specific subcellular compartments, and play different biological roles. Accumulating evidence shows that circRNAs regulate a diversity of cellular processes by acting as miRNA sponges, anchors for circRNA binding proteins (cRBPs), transcriptional regulators, molecular scaffolds, and sources for translation of small proteins/peptides. The emergence of the biological functions of circRNAs has brought a new perspective to our understanding of cellular physiology and disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that the expression of circRNAs is tissue- and cell type-specific and specifically regulated through development or disease progression, where they exert specific biological functions. However, the mechanisms underlying these remain largely unknown. A deeper understanding of how the specific expression of circRNAs is regulated to exert specific biological functions will enable the use of circRNA as a biomarker in clinical practice and the development of new therapeutic approaches. This review aims to summarize recent developments in circRNA biogenesis, functions, and molecular mechanisms. We also provide some specific circRNAs as examples to show their tissue-specific distribution and evaluate the possibility of applying circRNA technologies in molecular research and therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction in ageing and age-related diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35145250/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organismal ageing is accompanied by progressive loss of cellular function and systemic deterioration of multiple tissues, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death. Mitochondria have become recognized not merely as being energy suppliers but also as having an essential role in the development of diseases associated with ageing, such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. A growing body of evidence suggests that ageing and age-related diseases are tightly related to an energy supply and demand imbalance, which might be alleviated by a variety of interventions, including physical activity and calorie restriction, as well as naturally occurring molecules targeting conserved longevity pathways. Here, we review key historical advances and progress from the past few years in our understanding of the role of mitochondria in ageing and age-related metabolic diseases. We also highlight emerging scientific innovations using mitochondria-targeted therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Valosin Containing Protein (VCP): A Multistep Regulator of Autophagy</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35216053/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valosin containing protein (VCP) has emerged as a central protein in the regulation of the protein quality control (PQC) system. VCP mutations are causative of multisystem proteinopathies, which include neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), and share various signs of altered proteostasis, mainly associated with autophagy malfunctioning. Autophagy is a complex multistep degradative system essential for the maintenance of cell viability, especially in post-mitotic cells as neurons and differentiated skeletal muscle cells. Interestingly, many studies concerning NDs have focused on autophagy impairment as a pathological mechanism or autophagy activity boosting to rescue the pathological phenotype. The role of VCP in autophagy has been widely debated, but recent findings have defined new mechanisms associated with VCP activity in the regulation of autophagy, showing that VCP is involved in different steps of this pathway. Here we will discuss the multiple activity of VCP in the autophagic pathway underlying its leading role either in physiological or pathological conditions. A better understanding of VCP complexes and mechanisms in regulating autophagy could define the altered mechanisms by which VCP directly or indirectly causes or modulates different human diseases and revealing possible new therapeutic approaches for NDs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>p53 in ferroptosis regulation: the new weapon for the old guardian</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/35087226/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the conventional activities of p53 such as cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis are well accepted as the major checkpoints in stress responses, accumulating evidence implicates the importance of other tumor suppression mechanisms. Among these unconventional activities, an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death, termed ferroptosis, attracts great interest. Unlike apoptotic cell death, activation of p53 alone is not sufficient to induce ferroptosis directly; instead, through its metabolic targets, p53 is able to modulate the ferroptosis response in the presence of ferroptosis inducers such as GPX4 inhibitors or high levels of ROS. Here, we review the role of ferroptosis in p53-mediated tumor suppression, with a focus on what cellular factors are critical for p53-dependent ferroptosis during tumor suppression and how p53 modulates both the canonical (GPX4-dependent) and the non-canonical (GPX4-independent) ferroptosis pathways. We also discuss the possibility of targeting p53-mediated ferroptotic responses for the treatment of human cancers and potentially, other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting cancer metabolism in the era of precision oncology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred years have passed since Warburg discovered alterations in cancer metabolism, more than 70 years since Sidney Farber introduced anti-folates that transformed the treatment of childhood leukaemia, and 20 years since metabolism was linked to oncogenes. However, progress in targeting cancer metabolism therapeutically in the past decade has been limited. Only a few metabolism-based drugs for cancer have been successfully developed, some of which are in - or en route to - clinical trials. Strategies for targeting the intrinsic metabolism of cancer cells often did not account for the metabolism of non-cancer stromal and immune cells, which have pivotal roles in tumour progression and maintenance. By considering immune cell metabolism and the clinical manifestations of inborn errors of metabolism, it may be possible to isolate undesirable off-tumour, on-target effects of metabolic drugs during their development. Hence, the conceptual framework for drug design must consider the metabolic vulnerabilities of non-cancer cells in the tumour immune microenvironment, as well as those of cancer cells. In this Review, we cover the recent developments, notable milestones and setbacks in targeting cancer metabolism, and discuss the way forward for the field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current human exposome primarily emphasizes the total environmental exposure during an entire life. The characteristics of &amp;ldquo;lifelong&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;all environmental factors&amp;rdquo; make it very challenging to bring the exposomic study into real-life applications. Herein, we mainly discuss the typical application scenarios of exposomics and how to conduct an exposomic study to establish relationships between the exposome and human health. To increase the feasibility and efficiency, we propose that (1) an exposomic study can start with health events during critical-window periods; (2) both data- and hypothesis-driven exposomics should be combined to prioritize the risk of environmental factors; and (3) reliable statistical analysis of high-dimensional data of external and internal exposure factors are urgently needed. With standardization of the exposomic study, it will be critical to build a &amp;ldquo;wonderland&amp;rdquo; for human health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Highway to heal: Influence of altered extracellular matrix on infiltrating immune cells during acute and chronic lung diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental insults including respiratory infections, in combination with genetic predisposition, may lead to lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung fibrosis, asthma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Common characteristics of these diseases are infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells and abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, leading to tissue damage and impairments in lung function. The ECM provides three-dimensional (3D) architectural support to the lung and crucial biochemical and biophysical cues to the cells, directing cellular processes. As immune cells travel to reach any site of injury, they encounter the composition and various mechanical features of the ECM. Emerging evidence demonstrates the crucial role played by the local environment in recruiting immune cells and their function in lung diseases. Moreover, recent developments in the field have elucidated considerable differences in responses of immune cells in two-dimensional versus 3D modeling systems. Examining the effect of individual parameters of the ECM to study their effect independently and collectively in a 3D microenvironment will help in better understanding disease pathobiology. In this article, we discuss the importance of investigating cellular migration and recent advances in this field. Moreover, we summarize changes in the ECM in lung diseases and the potential impacts on infiltrating immune cell migration in these diseases. There has been compelling progress in this field that encourages further developments, such as advanced in vitro 3D modeling using native ECM-based models, patient-derived materials, and bioprinting. We conclude with an overview of these state-of-the-art methodologies, followed by a discussion on developing novel and innovative models and the practical challenges envisaged in implementing and utilizing these systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crosstalk between autophagy inhibitors and endosome-related secretory pathways: a challenge for autophagy-based treatment of solid cancers</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34706732/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is best known for its role in organelle and protein turnover, cell quality control, and metabolism. The autophagic machinery has, however, also adapted to enable protein trafficking and unconventional secretory pathways so that organelles (such as autophagosomes and multivesicular bodies) delivering cargo to lysosomes for degradation can change their mission from fusion with lysosomes to fusion with the plasma membrane, followed by secretion of the cargo from the cell. Some factors with key signalling functions do not enter the conventional secretory pathway but can be secreted in an autophagy-mediated manner.Positive clinical results of some autophagy inhibitors are encouraging. Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that autophagy inhibition, even within the same cancer type, can affect cancer progression differently. Even next-generation inhibitors of autophagy can have significant non-specific effects, such as impacts on endosome-related secretory pathways and secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Many studies suggest that cancer cells release higher amounts of EVs compared to non-malignant cells, which makes the effect of autophagy inhibitors on EVs secretion highly important and attractive for anticancer therapy. In this review article, we discuss how different inhibitors of autophagy may influence the secretion of EVs and summarize the non-specific effects of autophagy inhibitors with a focus on endosome-related secretory pathways. Modulation of autophagy significantly impacts not only the quantity of EVs but also their content, which can have a deep impact on the resulting pro-tumourigenic or anticancer effect of autophagy inhibitors used in the antineoplastic treatment of solid cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impact of intracellular innate immune receptors on immunometabolism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34697412/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunometabolism, which is the metabolic reprogramming of anaerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolite synthesis upon immune cell activation, has gained importance as a regulator of the homeostasis, activation, proliferation, and differentiation of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets that function as key factors in immunity. Metabolic changes in epithelial and other stromal cells in response to different stimulatory signals are also crucial in infection, inflammation, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders. The crosstalk between the PI3Kâ€“AKTâ€“mTOR and LKB1â€“AMPK signaling pathways is critical for modulating both immune and nonimmune cell metabolism. The bidirectional interaction between immune cells and metabolism is a topic of intense study. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytokine receptors, and T and B cell receptors have been shown to activate multiple downstream metabolic pathways. However, how intracellular innate immune sensors/receptors intersect with metabolic pathways is less well understood. The goal of this review is to examine the link between immunometabolism and the functions of several intracellular innate immune sensors or receptors, such as nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs, or NOD-like receptors), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptors (ALRs), and the cyclic dinucleotide receptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING). We will focus on recent advances and describe the impact of these intracellular innate immune receptors on multiple metabolic pathways. Whenever appropriate, this review will provide a brief contextual connection to pathogenic infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, metabolic disorders, and/or inflammatory bowel diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unprecedented advances have been made in cancer treatment with the use of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). However, responses are limited to a subset of patients, and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can be problematic, requiring treatment discontinuation. Iterative insights into factors intrinsic and extrinsic to the host that impact ICB response and toxicity are critically needed. Our understanding of the impact of host-intrinsic factors (such as the host genome, epigenome, and immunity) has evolved substantially over the past decade, with greater insights on these factors and on tumor and immune co-evolution. Additionally, we are beginning to understand the impact of acute and cumulative exposures-both internal and external to the host (i.e., the exposome)-on host physiology and response to treatment. Together these represent the current day hallmarks of response, resistance, and toxicity to ICB. Opportunities built on these hallmarks are duly warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The assembly, regulation and function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34621061/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system is central to cellular metabolism. It comprises five enzymatic complexes and two mobile electron carriers that work in a mitochondrial respiratory chain. By coupling the oxidation of reducing equivalents coming into mitochondria to the generation and subsequent dissipation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, this electron transport chain drives the production of ATP, which is then used as a primary energy carrier in virtually all cellular processes. Minimal perturbations of the respiratory chain activity are linked to diseases; therefore, it is necessary to understand how these complexes are assembled and regulated and how they function. In this Review, we outline the latest assembly models for each individual complex, and we also highlight the recent discoveries indicating that the formation of larger assemblies, known as respiratory supercomplexes, originates from the association of the intermediates of individual complexes. We then discuss how recent cryo-electron microscopy structures have been key to answering open questions on the function of the electron transport chain in mitochondrial respiration and how supercomplexes and other factors, including metabolites, can regulate the activity of the single complexes. When relevant, we discuss how these mechanisms contribute to physiology and outline their deregulation in human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human microbiome constitutes a complex multikingdom community that symbiotically interacts with the host across multiple body sites. Host-microbiome interactions impact multiple physiological processes and a variety of multifactorial disease conditions. In the past decade, microbiome communities have been suggested to influence the development, progression, metastasis formation, and treatment response of multiple cancer types. While causal evidence of microbial impacts on cancer biology is only beginning to be unraveled, enhanced molecular understanding of such cancer-modulating interactions and impacts on cancer treatment are considered of major scientific importance and clinical relevance. In this review, we describe the molecular pathogenic mechanisms shared throughout microbial niches that contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. We highlight advances, limitations, challenges, and prospects in understanding how the microbiome may causally impact cancer and its treatment responsiveness, and how microorganisms or their secreted bioactive metabolites may be potentially harnessed and targeted as precision cancer therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First we eat, then we do everything else: The dynamic metabolic regulation of efferocytosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34433074/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearance of apoptotic cells, or &amp;ldquo;efferocytosis,&amp;rdquo; is essential for diverse processes including embryonic development, tissue turnover, organ regeneration, and immune cell development. The human body is estimated to remove approximately 1% of its body mass via apoptotic cell clearance daily. This poses several intriguing cell metabolism problems. For instance, phagocytes such as macrophages must induce or suppress metabolic pathways to find, engulf, and digest apoptotic cells. Then, phagocytes must manage the potentially burdensome biomass of the engulfed apoptotic cell. Finally, phagocytes reside in complex tissue architectures that vary in nutrient availability, the types of dying cells or debris that require clearance, and the neighboring cells they interact with. Here, we review advances in our understanding of these three key areas of phagocyte metabolism. We end by proposing a model of efferocytosis that integrates recent findings and establishes a new paradigm for testing how efferocytosis prevents chronic inflammatory disease and autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown significant promises as nano-/micro-size carriers in drug delivery and bioimaging. With more characteristics of EVs explored through tremendous research efforts, their unmatched physicochemical properties, biological features, and mechanical aspects make them unique vehicles, owning exceptional pharmacokinetics, circulatory metabolism and biodistribution pattern when delivering theranostic cargoes. In this review we firstly analyzed pros and cons of the EVs as a delivery platform. Secondly, compared to engineered nanoparticle delivery systems, such as biocompatible di-block co-polymers, rational design to improve EVs (exosomes in particular) were elaborated. Lastly, different pharmaceutical loading approaches into EVs were compared, reaching a conclusion on how to construct a clinically available and effective nano-/micro-carrier for a satisfactory medical mission.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis to PANoptosis: A mechanistic compendium of programmed cell death pathways</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34504660/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis are the most genetically well-defined programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, and they are intricately involved in both homeostasis and disease. Although the identification of key initiators, effectors and executioners in each of these three PCD pathways has historically delineated them as distinct, growing evidence has highlighted extensive crosstalk among them. These observations have led to the establishment of the concept of PANoptosis, defined as an inflammatory PCD pathway regulated by the PANoptosome complex with key features of pyroptosis, apoptosis and/or necroptosis that cannot be accounted for by any of these PCD pathways alone. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the research history of pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis. We then examine the intricate crosstalk among these PCD pathways to discuss the current evidence for PANoptosis. We also detail the molecular evidence for the assembly of the PANoptosome complex, a molecular scaffold for contemporaneous engagement of key molecules from pyroptosis, apoptosis, and/or necroptosis. PANoptosis is now known to be critically involved in many diseases, including infection, sterile inflammation and cancer, and future discovery of novel PANoptotic components will continue to broaden our understanding of the fundamental processes of cell death and inform the development of new therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Machinery, regulation and pathophysiological implications of autophagosome maturation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34302147/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is a versatile degradation system for maintaining cellular homeostasis whereby cytosolic materials are sequestered in a double-membrane autophagosome and subsequently delivered to lysosomes, where they are broken down. In multicellular organisms, newly formed autophagosomes undergo a process called &amp;lsquo;maturation&amp;rsquo;, in which they fuse with vesicles originating from endolysosomal compartments, including early/late endosomes and lysosomes, to form amphisomes, which eventually become degradative autolysosomes. This fusion process requires the concerted actions of multiple regulators of membrane dynamics, including SNAREs, tethering proteins and RAB GTPases, and also transport of autophagosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes towards each other. Multiple mechanisms modulate autophagosome maturation, including post-translational modification of key components, spatial distribution of phosphoinositide lipid species on membranes, RAB protein dynamics, and biogenesis and function of lysosomes. Nutrient status and various stresses integrate into the autophagosome maturation machinery to coordinate the progression of autophagic flux. Impaired autophagosome maturation is linked to the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer and myopathies. Furthermore, invading pathogens exploit various strategies to block autophagosome maturation, thus evading destruction and even subverting autophagic vacuoles (autophagosomes, amphisomes and autolysosomes) for survival, growth and/or release. Here, we discuss the recent progress in our understanding of the machinery and regulation of autophagosome maturation, the relevance of these mechanisms to human pathophysiology and how they are harnessed by pathogens for their benefit. We also provide perspectives on targeting autophagosome maturation therapeutically.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumour initiation and progression requires the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. Cancer cells autonomously alter their flux through various metabolic pathways in order to meet the increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic demand as well as mitigate oxidative stress required for cancer cell proliferation and survival. Cancer driver mutations coupled with environmental nutrient availability control flux through these metabolic pathways. Metabolites, when aberrantly accumulated, can also promote tumorigenesis. The development and application of new technologies over the last few decades has not only revealed the heterogeneity and plasticity of tumours but also allowed us to uncover new metabolic pathways involved in supporting tumour growth. The tumour microenvironment (TME), which can be depleted of certain nutrients, forces cancer cells to adapt by inducing nutrient scavenging mechanisms to sustain cancer cell proliferation. There is growing appreciation that the metabolism of cell types other than cancer cells within the TME, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts and immune cells, can modulate tumour progression. Because metastases are a major cause of death of patients with cancer, efforts are underway to understand how metabolism is harnessed by metastatic cells. Additionally, there is a new interest in exploiting cancer genetic analysis for patient stratification and/or dietary interventions in combination with therapies that target metabolism. In this Perspective, we highlight these main themes that are currently under investigation in the context of in vivo tumour metabolism, specifically emphasizing questions that remain unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regulation of the nucleic acid-sensing Toll-like receptors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are unique to microorganisms, such that receptor activation unequivocally indicates the presence of something foreign. However, a subset of TLRs recognizes nucleic acids, which are present in both the host and foreign microorganisms. This specificity enables broad recognition by virtue of the ubiquity of nucleic acids but also introduces the possibility of self-recognition and autoinflammatory or autoimmune disease. Defining the regulatory mechanisms required to ensure proper discrimination between foreign and self-nucleic acids by TLRs is an area of intense research. Progress over the past decade has revealed a complex array of regulatory mechanisms that ensure maintenance of this delicate balance. These regulatory mechanisms can be divided into a conceptual framework with four categories: compartmentalization, ligand availability, receptor expression and signal transduction. In this Review, we discuss our current understanding of each of these layers of regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circadian rhythms regulate a remarkable variety of physiologic functions in living organisms. Circadian disruption is associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression through effects on cancer cell biological properties, including proliferation, DNA repair, apoptosis, metabolism, and stemness. Emerging evidence indicates that circadian clocks also play an influential role in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review outlines recent discoveries on how cancer cell clock components (including circadian clock and clock genes/proteins) regulate TME biology and, reciprocally, how TME clock components affect tumor growth, metastasis, and therapeutic response. An improved understanding of how clock components regulate the symbiosis between cancer cells and the TME will inform the development of novel clock-oriented therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global crisis and is more devastating than any other previous infectious disease. It has affected a significant proportion of the global population both physically and mentally, and destroyed businesses and societies. Current evidence suggested that immunopathology may be responsible for COVID-19 pathogenesis, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, dysregulation of monocytes and macrophages, reduced or delayed type I interferon (IFN-I) response, antibody-dependent enhancement, and especially, cytokine storm (CS). The CS is characterized by hyperproduction of an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines and is closely associated with poor prognosis. These excessively secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines initiate different inflammatory signaling pathways via their receptors on immune and tissue cells, resulting in complicated medical symptoms including fever, capillary leak syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure, ultimately leading to death in the most severe cases. Therefore, it is clinically important to understand the initiation and signaling pathways of CS to develop more effective treatment strategies for COVID-19. Herein, we discuss the latest developments in the immunopathological characteristics of COVID-19 and focus on CS including the current research status of the different cytokines involved. We also discuss the induction, function, downstream signaling, and existing and potential interventions for targeting these cytokines or related signal pathways. We believe that a comprehensive understanding of CS in COVID-19 will help to develop better strategies to effectively control immunopathology in this disease and other infectious and inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils are the most abundant myeloid cells in human blood and are emerging as important regulators of cancer. However, their functional importance has often been overlooked on the basis that they are short-lived, terminally differentiated and non-proliferative. Recent studies of their prominent roles in cancer have led to a paradigm shift in our appreciation of neutrophil functional diversity. This Review describes how neutrophil diversification, which in some contexts can lead to opposing functions, is generated within the tumour microenvironment as well as systemically. We compare neutrophil heterogeneity in cancer and in other pathophysiological contexts to provide an updated overview of our current knowledge of the functions of neutrophils in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular-vesicle-based cell-to-cell communication is conserved across all kingdoms of life. There is compelling evidence that extracellular vesicles are involved in major (patho)physiological processes, including cellular homoeostasis, infection propagation, cancer development and cardiovascular diseases. Various studies suggest that extracellular vesicles have several advantages over conventional synthetic carriers, opening new frontiers for modern drug delivery. Despite extensive research, clinical translation of extracellular-vesicle-based therapies remains challenging. Here, we discuss the uniqueness of extracellular vesicles along with critical design and development steps required to utilize their full potential as drug carriers, including loading methods, in-depth characterization and large-scale manufacturing. We compare the prospects of extracellular vesicles with those of the well established liposomes and provide guidelines to direct the process of developing vesicle-based drug delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crosstalk between nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and the innate immune response to viral infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nuclear pore complex is the sole gateway connecting the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. In humans, the nuclear pore complex is one of the largest multiprotein assemblies in the cell, with a molecular mass of âˆ¼110 MDa and consisting of 8 to 64 copies of about 34 different nuclear pore proteins, termed nucleoporins, for a total of 1000 subunits per pore. Trafficking events across the nuclear pore are mediated by nuclear transport receptors and are highly regulated. The nuclear pore complex is also used by several RNA viruses and almost all DNA viruses to access the host cell nucleoplasm for replication. Viruses hijack the nuclear pore complex, and nuclear transport receptors, to access the nucleoplasm where they replicate. In addition, the nuclear pore complex is used by the cell innate immune system, a network of signal transduction pathways that coordinates the first response to foreign invaders, including viruses and other pathogens. Several branches of this response depend on dynamic signaling events that involve the nuclear translocation of downstream signal transducers. Mounting evidence has shown that these signaling cascades, especially those steps that involve nucleocytoplasmic trafficking events, are targeted by viruses so that they can evade the innate immune system. This review summarizes how nuclear pore proteins and nuclear transport receptors contribute to the innate immune response and highlights how viruses manipulate this cellular machinery to favor infection. A comprehensive understanding of nuclear pore proteins in antiviral innate immunity will likely contribute to the development of new antiviral therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MYC protein interactors in gene transcription and cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transcription factor and oncoprotein MYC is a potent driver of many human cancers and can regulate numerous biological activities that contribute to tumorigenesis. How a single transcription factor can regulate such a diverse set of biological programmes is central to the understanding of MYC function in cancer. In this Perspective, we highlight how multiple proteins that interact with MYC enable MYC to regulate several central control points of gene transcription. These include promoter binding, epigenetic modifications, initiation, elongation and post-transcriptional processes. Evidence shows that a combination of multiple protein interactions enables MYC to function as a potent oncoprotein, working together in a &amp;lsquo;coalition model&amp;rsquo;, as presented here. Moreover, as MYC depends on its protein interactome for function, we discuss recent research that emphasizes an unprecedented opportunity to target protein interactors to directly impede MYC oncogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercellular communication among immune cells is vital for the coordination of proper immune responses. Extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) act as messengers in intercellular communication, with important consequences for target cell and organ physiology in both health and disease. Under normal physiological conditions, immune cell-derived EVPs participate in immune responses by regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. EVPs play a major role in antigen presentation and immune activation. On the other hand, immune cell-derived EVPs exert immunosuppressive and regulatory effects. Consequently, EVPs may contribute to pathological conditions, such as autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, graft rejection, and cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we provide an overview of the role of EVPs in immune homeostasis and pathophysiology, with a particular focus on their contribution to innate and adaptive immunity and their potential use for immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer greatly affects the quality of life of humans worldwide and the number of patients suffering from it is continuously increasing. Over the last century, numerous treatments have been developed to improve the survival of cancer patients but substantial progress still needs to be made before cancer can be truly cured. In recent years, antitumor immunity has become the most debated topic in cancer research and the booming development of immunotherapy has led to a new epoch in cancer therapy. In this review, we describe the relationships between tumors and the immune system, and the rise of immunotherapy. Then, we summarize the characteristics of tumor-associated immunity and immunotherapeutic strategies with various molecular mechanisms by showing the typical immune molecules whose antibodies are broadly used in the clinic and those that are still under investigation. We also discuss important elements from individual cells to the whole human body, including cellular mutations and modulation, metabolic reprogramming, the microbiome, and the immune contexture. In addition, we also present new observations and technical advancements of both diagnostic and therapeutic methods aimed at cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we discuss the controversies and challenges that negatively impact patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication between plant cells and interacting microorganisms requires the secretion and uptake of functional molecules to and from the extracellular environment and is essential for the survival of both plants and their pathogens. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-enclosed spheres that deliver RNA, protein, and metabolite cargos from donor to recipient cells and participate in many cellular processes. Emerging evidencehas shown that both plant and microbial EVs play important roles in cross-kingdom molecular exchange between hosts and interacting microbes to modulate host immunity and pathogen virulence. Recent studies revealed that plant EVs function as a defense system by encasing and delivering small RNAs (sRNAs) into pathogens, thereby mediating cross-species and cross-kingdom RNA interference to silence virulence-related genes. This review focuses on the latest advances in our understanding of plant and microbial EVs and their roles in transporting regulatory molecules, especially sRNAs, between hosts and pathogens. EV biogenesis and secretion are also discussed, as EV function relies on these important processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using single-vesicle technologies to unravel the heterogeneity of extracellular vesicles</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/34135505/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous lipid containers with a complex molecular cargo comprising several populations with unique roles in biological processes. These vesicles are closely associated with specific physiological features, which makes them invaluable in the detection and monitoring of various diseases. EVs play a key role in pathophysiological processes by actively triggering genetic or metabolic responses. However, the heterogeneity of their structure and composition hinders their application in medical diagnosis and therapies. This diversity makes it difficult to establish their exact physiological roles, and the functions and composition of different EV (sub)populations. Ensemble averaging approaches currently employed for EV characterization, such as western blotting or &amp;lsquo;omics&amp;rsquo; technologies, tend to obscure rather than reveal these heterogeneities. Recent developments in single-vesicle analysis have made it possible to overcome these limitations and have facilitated the development of practical clinical applications. In this review, we discuss the benefits and challenges inherent to the current methods for the analysis of single vesicles and review the contribution of these approaches to the understanding of EV biology. We describe the contributions of these recent technological advances to the characterization and phenotyping of EVs, examination of the role of EVs in cell-to-cell communication pathways and the identification and validation of EVs as disease biomarkers. Finally, we discuss the potential of innovative single-vesicle imaging and analysis methodologies using microfluidic devices, which promise to deliver rapid and effective basic and practical applications for minimally invasive prognosis systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, pyroptosis has received more and more attention because of its association with innate immunity and disease. The research scope of pyroptosis has expanded with the discovery of the gasdermin family. A great deal of evidence shows that pyroptosis can affect the development of tumors. The relationship between pyroptosis and tumors is diverse in different tissues and genetic backgrounds. In this review, we provide basic knowledge of pyroptosis, explain the relationship between pyroptosis and tumors, and focus on the significance of pyroptosis in tumor treatment. In addition, we further summarize the possibility of pyroptosis as a potential tumor treatment strategy and describe the side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy caused by pyroptosis. In brief, pyroptosis is a double-edged sword for tumors. The rational use of this dual effect will help us further explore the formation and development of tumors, and provide ideas for patients to develop new drugs based on pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exosomes, a class of small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm), are secreted by almost all types of cells into virtually all body fluids. These small vesicles are attracting increasing research attention owing to their potential for disease diagnosis and therapy. However, their inherent heterogeneity and the complexity of bio-fluids pose significant challenges for their isolation. Even the &amp;ldquo;gold standard,&amp;rdquo; differential centrifugation, suffers from poor yields and is time-consuming. In this context, recent developments in microfluidic technologies have provided an ideal system for exosome extraction and these devices exhibit some fascinating properties such as high speeds, good portability, and low sample volumes. In this review, the focus is on the state-of-the-art microfluidic technologies for exosome isolation and highlight potential directions for future research and development by analyzing the challenges faced by the current strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging life-threatening viruses have posed great challenges to public health. It is now increasingly clear that epigenetics plays a role in shaping host-virus interactions and there is a great need for a more thorough understanding of these intricate interactions through the epigenetic lens, which may represent potential therapeutic opportunities in the clinic. In this review, we highlight the current understanding of the roles of key epigenetic regulators - chromatin remodeling and histone modification - in modulating chromatin openness during host defense against virus. We also discuss how the RNA modification m6A (N6-methyladenosine) affects fundamental aspects of host-virus interactions. We conclude with future directions for uncovering more detailed functions that epigenetic regulation exerts on both host cells and viruses during infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FOXP3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; regulatory T (T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt;) cells located in non-lymphoid tissues differ in phenotype and function from their lymphoid organ counterparts. Tissue T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells have distinct transcriptomes, T cell receptor repertoires and growth and survival factor dependencies that arm them to survive and operate in their home tissue. Their functions extend beyond immune surveillance to tissue homeostasis, including regulation of local and systemic metabolism, promotion of tissue repair and regeneration, and control of the proliferation, differentiation and fate of non-lymphoid cell progenitors. T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells in diverse tissues share a common FOXP3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; precursor located within lymphoid organs. This precursor undergoes definitive specialization once in the home tissue, following a multilayered array of common and tissue-distinct transcriptional programmes. Our deepening knowledge of tissue T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cell biology will inform ongoing attempts to harness T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells for precision immunotherapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer has myriad effects on metabolism that include both rewiring of intracellular metabolism to enable cancer cells to proliferate inappropriately and adapt to the tumor microenvironment, and changes in normal tissue metabolism. With the recognition that fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging is an important tool for the management of many cancers, other metabolites in biological samples have been in the spotlight for cancer diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy. Metabolomics is the global analysis of small molecule metabolites that like other -omics technologies can provide critical information about the cancer state that are otherwise not apparent. Here, the authors review how cancer and cancer therapies interact with metabolism at the cellular and systemic levels. An overview of metabolomics is provided with a focus on currently available technologies and how they have been applied in the clinical and translational research setting. The authors also discuss how metabolomics could be further leveraged in the future to improve the management of patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Channelling inflammation: gasdermins in physiology and disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasdermins were recently identified as the mediators of pyroptosis - inflammatory cell death triggered by cytosolic sensing of invasive infection and danger signals. Upon activation, gasdermins form cell membrane pores, which release pro-inflammatory cytokines and alarmins and damage the integrity of the cell membrane. Roles for gasdermins in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, deafness and cancer are emerging, revealing potential novel therapeutic avenues. Here, we review current knowledge of the family of gasdermins, focusing on their mechanisms of action and roles in normal physiology and disease. Efforts to develop drugs to modulate gasdermin activity to reduce inflammation or activate more potent immune responses are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long noncoding RNAs in cancer metastasis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/33953369/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metastasis is a major contributor to cancer-associated deaths. It is characterized by a multistep process that occurs through the acquisition of molecular and phenotypic changes enabling cancer cells from a primary tumour to disseminate and colonize at distant organ sites. Over the past decade, the discovery and characterization of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have revealed the diversity of their regulatory roles, including key contributions throughout the metastatic cascade. Here, we review how lncRNAs promote metastasis by functioning in discrete pro-metastatic steps including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion and migration and organotrophic colonization, and by influencing the metastatic tumour microenvironment, often by interacting within ribonucleoprotein complexes or directly with other nucleic acid entities. We discuss well-characterized lncRNAs with in vivo phenotypes and highlight mechanistic commonalities such as convergence with the TGFÎ²-ZEB1/ZEB2 axis or the nuclear factor-ÎºB pathway, in addition to lncRNAs with controversial mechanisms and the influence of methodologies on mechanistic interpretation. Furthermore, some lncRNAs can help identify tumours with increased metastatic risk and spur novel therapeutic strategies, with several lncRNAs having shown potential as novel targets for antisense oligonucleotide therapy in animal models. In addition to well-characterized examples of lncRNAs functioning in metastasis, we discuss controversies and ongoing challenges in lncRNA biology. Finally, we present areas for future study for this rapidly evolving field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fibroblasts as immune regulators in infection, inflammation and cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/33911232/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chronic infection, inflammation and cancer, the tissue microenvironment controls how local immune cells behave, with tissue-resident fibroblasts emerging as a key cell type in regulating activation or suppression of an immune response. Fibroblasts are heterogeneous cells, encompassing functionally distinct populations, the phenotypes of which differ according to their tissue of origin and type of inciting disease. Their immunological properties are also diverse, ranging from the maintenance of a potent inflammatory environment in chronic inflammation to promoting immunosuppression in malignancy, and encapsulating and incarcerating infectious agents within tissues. In this Review, we compare the mechanisms by which fibroblasts control local immune responses, as well as the factors regulating their inflammatory and suppressive profiles, in different tissues and pathological settings. This cross-disease perspective highlights the importance of tissue context in determining fibroblast-immune cell interactions, as well as potential therapeutic avenues to exploit this knowledge for the benefit of patients with chronic infection, inflammation and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 7% of the human genome encodes cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that function as regulatory switches to modulate the expression of genes. These short genetic sequences control the complex transcriptional changes necessary for organismal development. A topical challenge in the field is to understand how transcription factors (TFs) read and translate this information into gene expression patterns. Here, I review how the development of single-molecule footprinting (SMF) that resolves the genome occupancy of TFs on individual DNA molecules resolution contributes to our ability to establish how the regulatory genetic information is interpreted at the mechanistic level. I further discuss how future developments in the nascent field of single-molecule genomics (SMG) could impact our understanding of gene regulation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Does the epithelial barrier hypothesis explain the increase in allergy, autoimmunity and other chronic conditions?</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/33846604/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a steep increase in allergic and autoimmune diseases, reaching epidemic proportions and now affecting more than one billion people worldwide. These diseases are more common in industrialized countries, and their prevalence continues to rise in developing countries in parallel to urbanization and industrialization. Intact skin and mucosal barriers are crucial for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis as they protect host tissues from infections, environmental toxins, pollutants and allergens. A defective epithelial barrier has been demonstrated in allergic and autoimmune conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, leakiness of the gut epithelium is also implicated in systemic autoimmune and metabolic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Finally, distant inflammatory responses due to a &amp;rsquo;leaky gut&amp;rsquo; and microbiome changes are suspected in Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, chronic depression and autism spectrum disorders. This article introduces an extended &amp;rsquo;epithelial barrier hypothesis&amp;rsquo;, which proposes that the increase in epithelial barrier-damaging agents linked to industrialization, urbanization and modern life underlies the rise in allergic, autoimmune and other chronic conditions. Furthermore, it discusses how the immune responses to dysbiotic microbiota that cross the damaged barrier may be involved in the development of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Systemic immunity in cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but efficacy remains limited in most clinical settings. Cancer is a systemic disease that induces many functional and compositional changes to the immune system as a whole. Immunity is regulated by interactions of diverse cell lineages across tissues. Therefore, an improved understanding of tumour immunology must assess the systemic immune landscape beyond the tumour microenvironment (TME). Importantly, the peripheral immune system is required to drive effective natural and therapeutically induced antitumour immune responses. In fact, emerging evidence suggests that immunotherapy drives new immune responses rather than the reinvigoration of pre-existing immune responses. However, new immune responses in individuals burdened with tumours are compromised even beyond the TME. Herein, we aim to comprehensively outline the current knowledge of systemic immunity in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The cGAS-STING pathway as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cGAS-STING signalling pathway has emerged as a key mediator of inflammation in the settings of infection, cellular stress and tissue damage. Underlying this broad involvement of the cGAS-STING pathway is its capacity to sense and regulate the cellular response towards microbial and host-derived DNAs, which serve as ubiquitous danger-associated molecules. Insights into the structural and molecular biology of the cGAS-STING pathway have enabled the development of selective small-molecule inhibitors with the potential to target the cGAS-STING axis in a number of inflammatory diseases in humans. Here, we outline the principal elements of the cGAS-STING signalling cascade and discuss the general mechanisms underlying the association of cGAS-STING activity with various autoinflammatory, autoimmune and degenerative diseases. Finally, we outline the chemical nature of recently developed cGAS and STING antagonists and summarize their potential clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function of lymphocytes is dependent on their plasticity, particularly their adaptation to energy availability and environmental stress, and their protein synthesis machinery. Lymphocytes are constantly under metabolic stress, and macroautophagy/autophagy is the primary metabolic pathway that helps cells overcome stressors. The intrinsic role of autophagy in regulating the metabolism of adaptive immune cells has recently gained increasing attention. In this review, we summarize and discuss the versatile roles of autophagy in regulating cellular metabolism and the implications of autophagy for immune cell function and fate, especially for T and B lymphocytes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extracellular matrix is a fundamental, core component of all tissues and organs, and is essential for the existence of multicellular organisms. From the earliest stages of organism development until death, it regulates and fine-tunes every cellular process in the body. In cancer, the extracellular matrix is altered at the biochemical, biomechanical, architectural and topographical levels, and recent years have seen an exponential increase in the study and recognition of the importance of the matrix in solid tumours. Coupled with the advancement of new technologies to study various elements of the matrix and cell-matrix interactions, we are also beginning to see the deployment of matrix-centric, stromal targeting cancer therapies. This Review touches on many of the facets of matrix biology in solid cancers, including breast, pancreatic and lung cancer, with the aim of highlighting some of the emerging interactions of the matrix and influences that the matrix has on tumour onset, progression and metastatic dissemination, before summarizing the ongoing work in the field aimed at developing therapies to co-target the matrix in cancer and cancer metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human lymphomas</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lymphomas are a diverse group of haematologic malignancies, which occur in infection-fighting cells of the lymphatic system. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs, which have recently received significant attention as the main mediators of gene expression. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on lncRNAs involved in lymphomas, their molecular functions, as well as their potential clinical value. Relevant literature was identified by a PubMed search of English language papers using the following terms: Lymphoma, LncRNA, leukemia, proliferation, apoptosis, and prognosis. LncRNAs are imperative for lymphoma carcinogenesis through affecting apoptosis, cell proliferation, invasion, and response to chemotherapy. The expression level of lncRNAs can affect chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Taken together, lncRNA dysregulation in lymphoma cells is not only an epiphenomenon but also lncRNA transcription is critically related to the initiation and progression of lymphomas. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs can lead to the transformation of normal lymphocytes into lymphoma cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Broadening horizons: the role of ferroptosis in cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/33514910/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of regulated cell death processes has enabled advances in cancer treatment. In the past decade, ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by excessive lipid peroxidation, has been implicated in the development and therapeutic responses of various types of tumours. Experimental reagents (such as erastin and RSL3), approved drugs (for example, sorafenib, sulfasalazine, statins and artemisinin), ionizing radiation and cytokines (such as IFNÎ³ and TGFÎ²1) can induce ferroptosis and suppress tumour growth. However, ferroptotic damage can trigger inflammation-associated immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment, thus favouring tumour growth. The extent to which ferroptosis affects tumour biology is unclear, although several studies have found important correlations between mutations in cancer-relevant genes (for example, &lt;em&gt;RAS&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt;), in genes encoding proteins involved in stress response pathways (such as NFE2L2 signalling, autophagy and hypoxia) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and responses to treatments that activate ferroptosis. Herein, we present the key molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis, describe the crosstalk between ferroptosis and tumour-associated signalling pathways, and discuss the potential applications of ferroptosis in the context of systemic therapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ferroptosis: mechanisms, biology and role in disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/33495651/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research field of ferroptosis has seen exponential growth over the past few years, since the term was coined in 2012. This unique modality of cell death, driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation, is regulated by multiple cellular metabolic pathways, including redox homeostasis, iron handling, mitochondrial activity and metabolism of amino acids, lipids and sugars, in addition to various signalling pathways relevant to disease. Numerous organ injuries and degenerative pathologies are driven by ferroptosis. Intriguingly, therapy-resistant cancer cells, particularly those in the mesenchymal state and prone to metastasis, are exquisitely vulnerable to ferroptosis. As such, pharmacological modulation of ferroptosis, via both its induction and its inhibition, holds great potential for the treatment of drug-resistant cancers, ischaemic organ injuries and other degenerative diseases linked to extensive lipid peroxidation. In this Review, we provide a critical analysis of the current molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks of ferroptosis, the potential physiological functions of ferroptosis in tumour suppression and immune surveillance, and its pathological roles, together with a potential for therapeutic targeting. Importantly, as in all rapidly evolving research areas, challenges exist due to misconceptions and inappropriate experimental methods. This Review also aims to address these issues and to provide practical guidelines for enhancing reproducibility and reliability in studies of ferroptosis. Finally, we discuss important concepts and pressing questions that should be the focus of future ferroptosis research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all animal cells contain proteins evolved to trigger the destruction of the cell in which they reside. The activation of these proteins occurs via sequential programs, and much effort has been expended in delineating the molecular mechanisms underlying the resulting processes of programmed cell death (PCD). These efforts have led to the definition of apoptosis as a form of nonimmunogenic PCD that is required for normal development and tissue homeostasis, and of pyroptosis and necroptosis as forms of PCD initiated by pathogen infection that are associated with inflammation and immune activation. While this paradigm has served the field well, numerous recent studies have highlighted cross talk between these programs, challenging the idea that apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis are linear pathways with defined immunological outputs. Here, we discuss the emerging idea of cell death as a signaling network, considering connections between cell death pathways both as we observe them now and in their evolutionary origins. We also discuss the engagement and subversion of cell death pathways by pathogens, as well as the key immunological outcomes of these processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deciphering molecular interactions by proximity labeling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many biological processes are executed and regulated through the molecular interactions of proteins and nucleic acids. Proximity labeling (PL) is a technology for tagging the endogenous interaction partners of specific protein â€˜baitsâ€™, via genetic fusion to promiscuous enzymes that catalyze the generation of diffusible reactive species in living cells. Tagged molecules that interact with baits can then be enriched and identified by mass spectrometry or nucleic acid sequencing. Here we review the development of PL technologies and highlight studies that have applied PL to the discovery and analysis of molecular interactions. In particular, we focus on the use of PL for mapping proteinâ€“protein, proteinâ€“RNA and proteinâ€“DNA interactions in living cells and organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The emerging roles of the MARCH ligases in antiviral innate immunity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membrane-associated RING (really interesting new gene)-cysteine-histidine (CH) (MARCH) ubiquitin ligases belong to a RING finger domain E3 ligases family. So far, eleven members have been found in the MARCH family, which are MARCH 1 to 11. The members of the MARCH family are widely distributed and involve in a variety of cellular functions, including regulation of the immune system, transmembrane transport of proteins, protein stability, endoplasmic reticulum-related degradation, and endosome protein transport. Several seminal studies over the past decade have delineated that MARCH affects viral replication through various mechanisms by regulating the activity of signaling molecules and their expression in the antiviral innate immune responses. Here, we summarize the complex roles of MARCH ligases in the antiviral innate immune signaling pathway and its impact on viral replication in host immune defense systems. A better understanding of this interplay&amp;rsquo;s molecular mechanisms is important concerning the development of new therapeutics targeting viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health is usually defined as the absence of pathology. Here, we endeavor to define health as a compendium of organizational and dynamic features that maintain physiology. The biological causes or hallmarks of health include features of spatial compartmentalization (integrity of barriers and containment of local perturbations), maintenance of homeostasis over time (recycling and turnover, integration of circuitries, and rhythmic oscillations), and an array of adequate responses to stress (homeostatic resilience, hormetic regulation, and repair and regeneration). Disruption of any of these interlocked features is broadly pathogenic, causing an acute or progressive derailment of the system coupled to the loss of numerous stigmata of health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ferroptosis: molecular mechanisms and health implications</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell death can be executed through different subroutines. Since the description of ferroptosis as an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death in 2012, there has been mounting interest in the process and function of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis can occur through two major pathways, the extrinsic or transporter-dependent pathway and the intrinsic or enzyme-regulated pathway. Ferroptosis is caused by a redox imbalance between the production of oxidants and antioxidants, which is driven by the abnormal expression and activity of multiple redox-active enzymes that produce or detoxify free radicals and lipid oxidation products. Accordingly, ferroptosis is precisely regulated at multiple levels, including epigenetic, transcriptional, posttranscriptional and posttranslational layers. The transcription factor NFE2L2 plays a central role in upregulating anti-ferroptotic defense, whereas selective autophagy may promote ferroptotic death. Here, we review current knowledge on the integrated molecular machinery of ferroptosis and describe how dysregulated ferroptosis is involved in cancer, neurodegeneration, tissue injury, inflammation, and infection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunometabolism has emerged as a key focus for immunologists, with metabolic change in immune cells becoming as important a determinant for specific immune effector responses as discrete signaling pathways. A key output for these changes involves post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins by metabolites. Products of glycolysis and Krebs cycle pathways can mediate these events, as can lipids, amino acids, and polyamines. A rich and diverse set of PTMs in macrophages and T cells has been uncovered, altering phenotype and modulating immunity and inflammation in different contexts. We review the recent findings in this area and speculate whether they could be of use in the effort to develop therapeutics for immune-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute or chronic cellular stress resulting from aberrant metabolic and biochemical processes may trigger a pervasive non-apoptotic form of cell death, generally known as ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is unique among the different cell death modalities, as it has been mostly linked to pathophysiological conditions and because several metabolic pathways, such as (seleno)thiol metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, iron handling, mevalonate pathway, and mitochondrial respiration, directly impinge on the cells&amp;rsquo; sensitivity toward lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Additionally, key cellular redox systems, such as selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase 4 and the NAD(P)H/ferroptosis suppressor protein-1/ubiquinone axis, are at play that constantly surveil and neutralize oxidative damage to cellular membranes. Since this form of cell death emerges to be the root cause of a number of diseases and since it offers various pharmacologically tractable nodes for therapeutic intervention, there has been overwhelming interest in the last few years aiming for a better molecular understanding of the ferroptotic death process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TET2, a member of ten-eleven translocation (TET) family as Î±-ketoglutarate- and Fe2+-dependent dioxygenase catalyzing the iterative oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), has been widely recognized to be an important regulator for normal hematopoiesis especially myelopoiesis. Mutation and dysregulation of TET2 contribute to the development of multiple hematological malignancies. Recent studies reveal that TET2 also plays an important role in innate immune homeostasis by promoting DNA demethylation or independent of its enzymatic activity. Here, we focus on the functions of TET2 in the initiation and resolution of inflammation through epigenetic regulation and signaling network. In addition, we highlight regulation of TET2 at various molecular levels as well as the correlated inflammatory diseases, which will provide the insight to intervene in the pathological process caused by TET2 dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial Fusion: The Machineries In and Out</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/33092941/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crystal structures of truncated mitofusin (MFN)1 and MFN2, the dynamin-like fusogens of the outer mitochondrial membrane, reveal their structural kinship to bacterial dynamin-like protein (BDLP). Human MFN1 and MFN2 bear subtle differences that govern the distinct biochemical properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GTP-dependent dimerization and conformational changes are key features of MFNs in driving outer membrane fusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short optic atrophy 1/short mitochondria genome maintenance 1 (s-OPA1/s-Mgm1) resembles fission dynamins in 3D architecture, highlighting a mechanism of inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) merging distinct from that of other known types of homotypic fusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OPA1/Mgm1 uses multiple intermolecular assemblies to achieve either IMM fusion or cristae shaping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structures of the mitochondrial fusion machinery provide important rules for comparing fusion DLPs with fission DLPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that constantly undergo fission and fusion. Disruption of mitochondrial dynamics undermines their function and causes several human diseases. The fusion of the outer (OMM) and inner mitochondrial membranes (IMM) is mediated by two classes of dynamin-like protein (DLP): mitofusin (MFN)/fuzzy onions 1 (Fzo1) and optic atrophy 1/mitochondria genome maintenance 1 (OPA1/Mgm1). Given the lack of structural information on these fusogens, the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial fusion remain unclear, even after 20 years. Here, we review recent advances in structural studies of the mitochondrial fusion machinery, discuss their implication for DLPs, and summarize the pathogenic mechanisms of disease-causing mutations in mitochondrial fusion DLPs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies are being increasingly approved for use in humans, it is important that we understand vector-host interactions in detail. With the advances in genome-wide genetic screening tools, a clear picture of AAV-host interactions is beginning to emerge. Understanding these interactions can provide insights into the viral life cycle. Accordingly, novel strategies to circumvent the current limitations of AAV-based vectors may be explored. Here, we summarize our current understanding of the various stages in the journey of the vector from the cell surface to the nucleus and contextualize the roles of recently identified host factors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decrypting UFMylation: How Proteins Are Modified with UFM1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides ubiquitin (Ub), humans have a set of ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) that can also covalently modify target proteins. To date, less is known about UBLs than Ub and even less is known about the UBL called ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1). Currently, our understanding of protein modification by UFM1 (UFMylation) is like a jigsaw puzzle with many missing pieces, and in some cases it is not even clear whether these pieces of data are in the right place. Here we review the current data on UFM1 from structural biology to biochemistry and cell biology. We believe that the physiological significance of protein modification by UFM1 is currently underestimated and there is more to it than meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Translation of noncoding RNAs and cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ncRNAs are translated into stable peptides or proteins, expanding the landscape of the proteome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tools, methods and databases are designed for identifying and validating ncRNA-encoded peptides related with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The translation of lncRNAs provides a novel molecular mechanism to participate in complex regulatory networks of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CircRNA-encoded peptides in cancer may become drug targets and biomarkers for diagnosing or predicting the prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human genome contains thousands of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are thought to lack open reading frames (ORFs) and cannot be translated. Some ncRNAs reportedly have important functions, including epigenetic regulation, chromatin remolding, protein modification, and RNA degradation, but the functions of most ncRNAs remain elusive. Through the application and development of ribosome profiling and sequencing technologies, an increasing number of studies have discovered the translation of ncRNAs. Although ncRNAs were initially defined as noncoding RNAs, a number of ncRNAs actually contain ORFs that are translated into peptides. Here, we summarize the available methods, tools, and databases for identifying and validating ncRNA-encoded peptides/proteins, and the recent findings regarding ncRNA-encoded small peptides/proteins in cancer are compiled and synthesized. Importantly, the role of ncRNA-encoding peptides/proteins has application prospects in cancer research, but some potential challenges remain unresolved. The aim of this review is to provide a theoretical basis that might promote the discovery of more peptides/proteins encoded by ncRNAs and aid the further development of novel diagnostic and prognostic cancer markers and therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophages are cells of the innate immune system that regulate the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, host defense during pathogen infection, and tissue repair in response to tissue injury. Recent studies indicate that macrophage functions are influenced by cellular metabolism, including lipid metabolism. Here, we review how macrophage lipid metabolism can be dynamically altered in different physiological and pathophysiological contexts and the key regulators involved. We also describe how alterations in lipid metabolism are integrated with the signaling pathways that specify macrophage functions, allowing for coordinated control of macrophage biology. Finally, we discuss how dysregulated lipid metabolism contributes to perturbed macrophage functions in settings such as atherosclerosis and pathogen infections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting Ferroptosis: New Hope for As-Yet-Incurable Diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/32958404/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attaining control over life and death decisions facilitates the identification of new therapeutic strategies for diseases affected by early cell loss or resistance to cell death. In this context, ferroptosis, a prevailing form of non-apoptotic cell death marked by the iron-dependent oxidative destruction of lipid bilayers and metabolic aberrations, has attracted overwhelming interest among basic researchers and clinicians due to its relevance for a number of degenerative diseases, such as neurodegeneration, ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), and organ failure, as well as therapy-resistant tumors. As the ferroptotic death pathway offers various druggable nodes, it is anticipated that the preclinical and clinical development of ferroptosis modulators will unleash unprecedented opportunities for the treatment of as-yet-incurable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autosis: A New Target to Prevent Cell Death</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/32875173/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autosis is an autophagy-dependent, nonapoptotic, and non-necrotic form of cell death that is characterized by unique morphological and biochemical features, including the presence of ballooning of perinuclear space (PNS) and sensitivity to cardiac glycosides, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autotic cell death may be initiated by excessive accumulation of autophagosomes rather than lysosomal degradation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autosis is stimulated during the late phase of reperfusion after a period of ischemia in the heart when up-regulation of rubicon in the presence of continuous autophagosome production induces massive accumulation of autophagosomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppression of autosis, which may reduce death of cardiomyocytes during the late phase of reperfusion, in combination with inhibition of apoptosis and necrosis targeting the early phase of injury, may enhance the effectiveness of treatment for I/R injury in the heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive autophagy induces a defined form of cell death called autosis, which is characterized by unique morphological features, including ballooning of perinuclear space and biochemical features, including sensitivity to cardiac glycosides. Autosis is observed during the late phase of reperfusion after a period of ischemia and contributes to myocardial injury. This review discusses unique features of autosis, the involvement of autosis in myocardial injury, and the molecular mechanism of autosis. Because autosis promotes myocardial injury under some conditions, a better understanding of autosis may lead to development of novel interventions to protect the heart against myocardial stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lactate modulation of immune responses in inflammatory versus tumour microenvironments</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microenvironment in cancerous tissues is immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic, whereas the microenvironment of tissues affected by chronic inflammatory disease is pro-inflammatory and anti-resolution. Despite these opposing immunological states, the metabolic states in the tissue microenvironments of cancer and inflammatory diseases are similar: both are hypoxic, show elevated levels of lactate and other metabolic by-products and have low levels of nutrients. In this Review, we describe how the bioavailability of lactate differs in the microenvironments of tumours and inflammatory diseases compared with normal tissues, thus contributing to the establishment of specific immunological states in disease. A clear understanding of the metabolic signature of tumours and inflammatory diseases will enable therapeutic intervention aimed at resetting the bioavailability of metabolites and correcting the dysregulated immunological state, triggering beneficial cytotoxic, inflammatory responses in tumours and immunosuppressive responses in chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PANoptosis in microbial infection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immune system has evolved multiple mechanisms to restrict microbial infections and regulate inflammatory responses. Without appropriate regulation, infection-induced inflammatory pathology can be deadly. The innate immune system recognizes the microbial molecules conserved in many pathogens and engages a rapid response by producing inflammatory mediators and activating programmed cell death pathways, including pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Activation of pattern recognition receptors, in combination with inflammatory cytokine-induced signaling through death domain-containing receptors, initiates a highly interconnected cell death process called PANoptosis (pyroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis). Broadly speaking, PANoptosis is critical for restricting a wide range of pathogens (including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites), which we describe in this review. We propose that re-examining the role of cell death and inflammatory cytokines through the lens of PANoptosis will advance our understanding of host-pathogen evolution and may reveal new treatment strategies for controlling a wide range of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circadian rhythms and obesity: Timekeeping governs lipid metabolism</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/32656907/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all living organisms have evolved autoregulatory transcriptional-translational feedback loops that produce oscillations with a period of approximately 24-h. These endogenous time keeping mechanisms are called circadian clocks. The main function of these circadian clocks is to drive overt circadian rhythms in the physiology of the organisms to ensure that main physiological functions are in synchrony with the external environment. Disruption of circadian rhythms caused by genetic or environmental factors has long-term consequences for metabolic health. Of relevance, host circadian rhythmicity and lipid metabolism are increasingly recognized to cross-regulate and the circadian clock-lipid metabolism interplay may involve in the development of obesity. Multiple systemic and molecular mechanisms, such as hormones (ie, melatonin, leptin, and glucocorticoid), the gut microbiome, and energy metabolism, link the circadian clock and lipid metabolism, and predictably, the deregulation of circadian clock-lipid metabolism interplay can increase the risk of obesity, which in turn may exacerbate circadian disorganization. Feeding time and dietary nutrients are two of key environmental Zeitgebers affecting the circadian rhythm-lipid metabolism interplay, and the influencing mechanisms in obesity development are highlighted in this review. Together, the characterization of the clock machinery in lipid metabolism aimed at producing a healthy circadian lifestyle may improve obesity care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viral tracers are important tools for neuroanatomical mapping and genetic payload delivery. Genetically modified viruses allow for cell-type-specific targeting and overcome many limitations of non-viral tracers. Here, we summarize the viruses that have been developed for neural circuit mapping, and we provide a primer on currently applied anterograde and retrograde viral tracers with practical guidance on experimental uses. We also discuss and highlight key technical and conceptual considerations for developing new safer and more effective anterograde trans-synaptic viral vectors for neural circuit analysis in multiple species.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils play a key role in defence against infection and in the activation and regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. In cancer, tumour-associated neutrophils (TANs) have emerged as an important component of the tumour microenvironment. Here, they can exert dual functions. TANs can be part of tumour-promoting inflammation by driving angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodelling, metastasis and immunosuppression. Conversely, neutrophils can also mediate antitumour responses by direct killing of tumour cells and by participating in cellular networks that mediate antitumour resistance. Neutrophil diversity and plasticity underlie the dual potential of TANs in the tumour microenvironment. Myeloid checkpoints as well as the tumour and tissue contexture shape neutrophil function in response to conventional therapies and immunotherapy. We surmise that neutrophils can provide tools to tailor current immunotherapy strategies and pave the way to myeloid cell-centred therapeutic strategies, which would be complementary to current approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amino acids are fundamental building blocks supporting life. Their role in protein synthesis is well defined, but they contribute to a host of other intracellular metabolic pathways, including ATP generation, nucleotide synthesis, and redox balance, to support cellular and organismal function. Immune cells critically depend on such pathways to acquire energy and biomass and to reprogram their metabolism upon activation to support growth, proliferation, and effector functions. Amino acid metabolism plays a key role in this metabolic rewiring, and it supports various immune cell functions beyond increased protein synthesis. Here, we review the mechanisms by which amino acid metabolism promotes immune cell function, and how these processes could be targeted to improve immunity in pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Gastroenterological Association&amp;rsquo;s Center for Gastrointestinal Innovation and Technology convened a consensus conference in December 2018, entitled, &amp;ldquo;Colorectal Cancer Screening and Surveillance: Role of Emerging Technology and Innovation to Improve Outcomes.&amp;rdquo; The goal of the conference, which attracted more than 60 experts in screening and related disciplines, including the authors, was to envision a future in which colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and surveillance are optimized, and to identify barriers to achieving that future. This White Paper originates from that meeting and delineates the priorities and steps needed to improve CRC outcomes, with the goal of minimizing CRC morbidity and mortality. A one-size-fits-all approach to CRC screening has not and is unlikely to result in increased screening uptake or desired outcomes owing to barriers stemming from behavioral, cultural, and socioeconomic causes, especially when combined with inefficiencies in deployment of screening technologies. Overcoming these barriers will require the following: efficient utilization of multiple screening modalities to achieve increased uptake; continued development of noninvasive screening tests, with iterative reassessments of how best to integrate new technologies; and improved personal risk assessment to better risk-stratify patients for appropriate screening testing paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nuclear innate sensors for nucleic acids in immunity and inflammation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innate sensors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to initiate innate immune response by activating downstream signaling. These evolutionarily conserved innate sensors usually locate in the plasma membrane or cytoplasm. However, the nucleus-localized innate sensors are recently found to detect pathogenic nucleic acids for initiating innate response, demonstrating a complicated crosstalk with cytoplasmic sensors and signaling molecules to form an elaborate tiered innate signaling network between nucleus and cytoplasm. Furthermore, these nuclear innate sensors evolve varied mechanisms for discriminating self from non-self nucleic acids to maintain immune homeostasis and avoid autoinflammatory immune response. In this review, we summarize the recent findings on the identification of nuclear innate sensors for nucleic acids, such as hnRNPA2B1, IFI16, SAFA, and their roles in host defense and inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Classical and Nonclassical Intercellular Communication in Senescence and Ageing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/32505550/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercellular communication is a key feature in physiological and pathological conditions. We hypothesize that several means of intercellular communication occur either simultaneously or in succession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most studied means of intercellular communication are soluble factors. However, important alternative means are emerging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senescent cells are highly proactive and communicate with neighboring cells via various means of intercellular communication including but not limited to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most studies of pharmacological drugs preventing the release of soluble factors oversee the influence of these drugs on other means of communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercellular communication refers to the different ways through which cells communicate with each other and transfer a variety of messages. These communication methods involve a number of different processes that occur individually or simultaneously, which change depending on the physiological or pathological context. The best characterized means of intercellular communication is the release of soluble factors that affect the function of neighboring cells. However, there are many other ways by which cells can communicate with each other. Here, we review the different means of intercellular communication including soluble factors in the context of senescence, ageing, and age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The PANoptosome: A Deadly Protein Complex Driving Pyroptosis, Apoptosis, and Necroptosis (PANoptosis)</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/32582562/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmed cell death is regulated by evolutionarily conserved pathways that play critical roles in development and the immune response. A newly recognized pathway for proinflammatory programmed cell death called PANoptosis is controlled by a recently identified cytoplasmic multimeric protein complex named the PANoptosome. The PANoptosome can engage, in parallel, three key modes of programmed cell death-pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The PANoptosome components have been implicated in a wide array of human diseases including autoinflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, microbial infections, and metabolic diseases. Here, we review putative components of the PANoptosome and present a phylogenetic analysis of their molecular domains and interaction motifs that support complex assembly. We also discuss genetic data that suggest PANoptosis is coordinated by scaffolding and catalytic functions of the complex components and propose mechanistic models for PANoptosome assembly. Overall, this review presents potential mechanisms governing PANoptosis based on evolutionary analysis of the PANoptosome components.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to develop anti-cancer therapies have largely focused on targeting the epithelial compartment, despite the presence of non-neoplastic stromal components that substantially contribute to the progression of the tumor. Indeed, cancer cell survival, growth, migration, and even dormancy are influenced by the surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME). Within the TME, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been shown to play several roles in the development of a tumor. They secrete growth factors, inflammatory ligands, and extracellular matrix proteins that promote cancer cell proliferation, therapy resistance, and immune exclusion. However, recent work indicates that CAFs may also restrain tumor progression in some circumstances. In this review, we summarize the body of work on CAFs, with a particular focus on the most recent discoveries about fibroblast heterogeneity, plasticity, and functions. We also highlight the commonalities of fibroblasts present across different cancer types, and in normal and inflammatory states. Finally, we present the latest advances regarding therapeutic strategies targeting CAFs that are undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interaction Between the Microbiota, Epithelia, and Immune Cells in the Intestine</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/32340570/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gastrointestinal tract harbors numerous commensal bacteria, referred to as the microbiota, that benefit host health by digesting dietary components and eliminating pathogens. The intestinal microbiota maintains epithelial barrier integrity and shapes the mucosal immune system, balancing host defense and oral tolerance with microbial metabolites, components, and attachment to host cells. To avoid aberrant immune responses, epithelial cells segregate the intestinal microbiota from immune cells by constructing chemical and physical barriers, leading to the establishment of host-commensal mutualism. Furthermore, intestinal immune cells participate in the maintenance of a healthy microbiota community and reinforce epithelial barrier functions. Perturbations of the microbiota composition are commonly observed in patients with autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory disorders. An understanding of the intimate interactions between the intestinal microbiota, epithelial cells, and immune cells that are crucial for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis might promote advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that is characterized by chronic inflammation of any part of the gastrointestinal tract, has a progressive and destructive course and is increasing in incidence worldwide. Several factors have been implicated in the cause of Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease, including a dysregulated immune system, an altered microbiota, genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, but the cause of the disease remains unknown. The onset of the disease at a young age in most cases necessitates prompt but long-term treatment to prevent disease flares and disease progression with intestinal complications. Thus, earlier, more aggressive treatment with biologic therapies or novel small molecules could profoundly change the natural history of the disease and decrease complications and the need for hospitalization and surgery. Although less invasive biomarkers are in development, diagnosis still relies on endoscopy and histological assessment of biopsy specimens. Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease is a complex disease, and treatment should be personalized to address the underlying pathogenetic mechanism. In the future, disease management might rely on severity scores that incorporate prognostic factors, bowel damage assessment and non-invasive close monitoring of disease activity to reduce the severity of complications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) comprise a large class of over 2,000 proteins that interact with transcripts in all manner of RNA-driven processes. The structures and mechanisms that RBPs use to bind and regulate RNA are incredibly diverse. In this review, we take a look at the components of protein-RNA interaction, from the molecular level to multi-component interaction. We first summarize what is known about protein-RNA molecular interactions based on analyses of solved structures. We additionally describe software currently available for predicting protein-RNA interaction and other resources useful for the study of RBPs. We then review the structure and function of seventeen known RNA-binding domains and analyze the hydrogen bonds adopted by protein-RNA structures on a domain-by-domain basis. We conclude with a summary of the higher-level mechanisms that regulate protein-RNA interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From Association to Causality: the Role of the Gut Microbiota and Its Functional Products on Host Metabolism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many genomic studies have revealed associations between the gut microbiota composition and host metabolism. These observations led to the idea that a causal relationship could exist between the microbiota and metabolic diseases, a concept supported by studies showing compositional changes in the microbial community in metabolic diseases and transmissibility of host phenotype via microbiota transfer. Accumulating data suggest that the microbiota may affect host metabolic phenotypes through the production of metabolites. These bioactive microbial metabolites, sensitive fingerprints of microbial function, can act as inter-kingdom signaling messengers via penetration into host blood circulation and tissues. These fingerprints may be used for diagnostic purposes, and increased understanding of strain specificity in producing microbial metabolites can identify bacterial strains or specific metabolites that can be used for therapeutic purposes. Here, we will review data supporting the causal role of the gut microbiota in metabolism and discuss mechanisms and potential clinical implications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cirrhosis is a multisystemic disease wherein inflammatory responses originating from advanced liver disease and its sequelae affect distant compartments. Patients with cirrhosis are susceptible to bacterial infections, which may precipitate acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure, both of which are associated with high short-term mortality. Innate immune cells are an essential first line of defence against pathogens. Activation of liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) and resident mastocytes generate proinflammatory and vaso-permeating mediators that induce accumulation of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils and monocytes in the liver, and promote tissue damage. During cirrhosis progression, damage- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns activate immune cells and promote development of systemic inflammatory responses which may involve different tissues and compartments. The antibacterial function of circulating neutrophils and monocytes is gradually and severely impaired as cirrhosis worsens, contributing to disease progression. The mechanisms underlying impaired antimicrobial responses are complex and incompletely understood. This review focuses on the continuous and distinct perturbations arising in innate immune cells during cirrhosis, including their impact on disease progression, as well as reviewing potential therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell death is an essential feature of development in multicellular organisms, a critical driver of degenerative diseases, and can be harnessed for treating some cancers. Understanding the mechanisms governing cell death is critical for addressing its role in disease. Similarly, metabolism is essential for normal energy and biomolecule production, and goes awry in many diseases. Metabolism and cell death are tightly linked in the phenomenon of ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by peroxidation of phospholipids. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) uses glutathione to protect cells from ferroptosis by eliminating phospholipid peroxides. Recent data have revealed glutathione/GPX4-independent axes for suppressing ferroptosis, and insight into the regulation of iron and mitochondria in ferroptosis. Ferroptosis has recently been implicated in multiple diseases, and functions as a tumor suppression mechanism. Ferroptosis induction is a promising approach in treating several conditions, including neoplastic diseases. Here, we summarize these recent advances.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Golgi apparatus serves as a receiving station where proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are further processed before being sent to other cellular compartments. In addition to its well-appreciated roles in vesicular trafficking and protein/lipid secretion, recent studies have demonstrated that the Golgi acts as a signaling platform to facilitate multiple innate immune pathways. Moreover, the membranous networks that connect the Golgi with the ER, mitochondria, endosomes, and autophagosomes provide convenient access to innate immune signal transduction and subsequent effector responses. Here, we review the emerging knowledge about the roles of the Golgi in the initiation and activation of innate immune signaling. Moreover, microbial hijacking strategies that inhibit Golgi-associated innate immune responses will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptive immunity is essential for pathogen and tumor eradication, but may also trigger uncontrolled or pathological inflammation. T cell receptor, co-stimulatory and cytokine signals coordinately dictate specific signaling networks that trigger the activation and functional programming of T cells. In addition, cellular metabolism promotes T cell responses and is dynamically regulated through the interplay of serine/threonine kinases, immunological cues and nutrient signaling networks. In this review, we summarize the upstream regulators and signaling effectors of key serine/threonine kinase-mediated signaling networks, including PI3K-AGC kinases, mTOR and LKB1-AMPK pathways that regulate metabolism, especially in T cells. We also provide our perspectives about the pending questions and clinical applicability of immunometabolic signaling. Understanding the regulators and effectors of immunometabolic signaling networks may uncover therapeutic targets to modulate metabolic programming and T cell responses in human disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ER-Phagy: Quality Control and Turnover of Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest organelle in cells and has fundamental functions, such as folding, processing, and trafficking of proteins, cellular metabolism, and ion storage. To maintain its function, it is turned over constitutively, and even more actively under certain stress conditions. Quality control of the ER is mediated primarily by two pathways: the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy (termed &amp;lsquo;ER-phagy&amp;rsquo;). The identification of ER-phagy adaptor molecules has shed light on the mechanisms and physiological significance of ER-phagy. Here, we describe recent findings on various types of ER-phagy and present unanswered questions related to their mechanism and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene delivery was recently approved for the treatment of inherited blindness and spinal muscular atrophy, and long-term therapeutic effects have been achieved for other rare diseases, including haemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, current research indicates that the genetic modification of AAV vectors may further facilitate the success of AAV gene therapy. Vector engineering can increase AAV transduction efficiency (by optimizing the transgene cassette), vector tropism (using capsid engineering) and the ability of the capsid and transgene to avoid the host immune response (by genetically modifying these components), as well as optimize the large-scale production of AAV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has the potential to identify unknown cellular and molecular mechanisms in intercellular communication and in organ homeostasis and disease. Exosomes, with an average diameter of ~100 nanometers, are a subset of EVs. The biogenesis of exosomes involves their origin in endosomes, and subsequent interactions with other intracellular vesicles and organelles generate the final content of the exosomes. Their diverse constituents include nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, amino acids, and metabolites, which can reflect their cell of origin. In various diseases, exosomes offer a window into altered cellular or tissue states, and their detection in biological fluids potentially offers a multicomponent diagnostic readout. The efficient exchange of cellular components through exosomes can inform their applied use in designing exosome-based therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Caspases in Cell Death, Inflammation, and Pyroptosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/32017655/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caspases are a family of conserved cysteine proteases that play key roles in programmed cell death and inflammation. In multicellular organisms, caspases are activated via macromolecular signaling complexes that bring inactive procaspases together and promote their proximity-induced autoactivation and proteolytic processing. Activation of caspases ultimately results in programmed execution of cell death, and the nature of this cell death is determined by the specific caspases involved. Pioneering new research has unraveled distinct roles and cross talk of caspases in the regulation of programmed cell death, inflammation, and innate immune responses. In-depth understanding of these mechanisms is essential to foster the development of precise therapeutic targets to treat autoinflammatory disorders, infectious diseases, and cancer. This review focuses on mechanisms governing caspase activation and programmed cell death with special emphasis on the recent progress in caspase cross talk and caspase-driven gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many eukaryotic protein-coding genes are able to generate exonic circular RNAs. Most of these covalently linked transcripts are expressed at low levels, but some accumulate to higher levels than their associated linear mRNAs. We highlight several methodologies that have been developed in recent years to identify and characterize these transcripts, and which have revealed an increasingly detailed view of how circular RNAs can be generated and function. It is now clear that modulation of circular RNA levels can result in a variety of molecular and physiological phenotypes, including effects on the nervous system, innate immunity, microRNAs, and many disease-relevant pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Squeezing in a Meal: Myosin Functions in Phagocytosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phagocytosis is a receptor-mediated, actin-dependent process of internalization of large extracellular particles, such as pathogens or apoptotic cells. Engulfment of phagocytic targets requires the activity of myosins, actin-dependent molecular motors, which perform a variety of functions at distinct steps during phagocytosis. By applying force to actin filaments, the plasma membrane, and intracellular proteins and organelles, myosins can generate contractility, directly regulate actin assembly to ensure proper phagocytic internalization, and translocate phagosomes or other cargo to appropriate cellular locations. Recent studies using engineered microenvironments and phagocytic targets have demonstrated how altering the actomyosin cytoskeleton affects phagocytic behavior. Here, we discuss how studies using genetic and biochemical manipulation of myosins, force measurement techniques, and live-cell imaging have advanced our understanding of how specific myosins function at individual steps of phagocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A road map for understanding molecular and genetic determinants of osteoporosis</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/31792439/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is a highly prevalent disorder characterized by low bone mineral density and an increased risk of fracture, termed osteoporotic fracture. Notably, bone mineral density, osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture are highly heritable; however, determining the genetic architecture, and especially the underlying genomic and molecular mechanisms, of osteoporosis in vivo in humans is still challenging. In addition to susceptibility loci identified in genome-wide association studies, advances in various omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics, have all been applied to dissect the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. However, each technology individually cannot capture the entire view of the disease pathology and thus fails to comprehensively identify the underlying pathological molecular mechanisms, especially the regulatory and signalling mechanisms. A change to the status quo calls for integrative multi-omics and inter-omics analyses with approaches in &amp;lsquo;systems genetics and genomics&amp;rsquo;. In this Review, we highlight findings from genome-wide association studies and studies using various omics technologies individually to identify mechanisms of osteoporosis. Furthermore, we summarize current studies of data integration to understand, diagnose and inform the treatment of osteoporosis. The integration of multiple technologies will provide a road map to illuminate the complex pathogenesis of osteoporosis, especially from molecular functional aspects, in vivo in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Hippo Pathway, YAP/TAZ, and the Plasma Membrane</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plasma membrane structures direct dynamic and context-specific cellular signaling via the Hippo pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hippo pathway components â€˜moonlightâ€™ via interactions with plasma membrane structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YAZ and TAZ drive expression of components involved in the generation of specialized plasma membrane domains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hippo pathway is integrated into multiple levels of cellular feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plasma membrane allows the cell to sense and adapt to changes in the extracellular environment by relaying external inputs via intracellular signaling networks. One central cellular signaling pathway is the Hippo pathway, which regulates homeostasis and plays chief roles in carcinogenesis and regenerative processes. Recent studies have found that mechanical stimuli and diffusible chemical components can regulate the Hippo pathway primarily through receptors embedded in the plasma membrane. Morphologically defined structures within the plasma membrane, such as cellular junctions, focal adhesions, primary cilia, caveolae, clathrin-coated pits, and plaques play additional key roles. Here, we discuss recent evidence highlighting the importance of these specialized plasma membrane domains in cellular feedback via the Hippo pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dissecting Aging and Senescence-Current Concepts and Open Lessons</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/31731770/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the programmed nature of development, it is still a matter of debate whether aging is an adaptive and regulated process, or merely a consequence arising from a stochastic accumulation of harmful events that culminate in a global state of reduced fitness, risk for disease acquisition, and death. Similarly unanswered are the questions of whether aging is reversible and can be turned into rejuvenation as well as how aging is distinguishable from and influenced by cellular senescence. With the discovery of beneficial aspects of cellular senescence and evidence of senescence being not limited to replicative cellular states, a redefinition of our comprehension of aging and senescence appears scientifically overdue. Here, we provide a factor-based comparison of current knowledge on aging and senescence, which we converge on four suggested concepts, thereby implementing the newly emerging cellular and molecular aspects of geroconversion and amitosenescence, and the signatures of a genetic state termed genosenium. We also address the possibility of an aging-associated secretory phenotype in analogy to the well-characterized senescence-associated secretory phenotype and delineate the impact of epigenetic regulation in aging and senescence. Future advances will elucidate the biological and molecular fingerprints intrinsic to either process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wnt Signaling in 3D: Recent Advances in the Applications of Intestinal Organoids</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/31718893/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using organoid technology, adult epithelial stem cells can be expanded &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; to generate self-organizing 3D epithelial structures that closely recapitulate the architecture and cellular composition of the tissue of origin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of their strict dependence on Wnt ligands for survival and growth, intestinal organoids have become the tool of choice for &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; studies aimed at revealing mechanistic aspects of Wnt signaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adult stem cell- and patient-derived intestinal organoids can serve as a platform for investigating mutation-induced disease mechanisms. Insights into how specific mutations alter Wnt activity are becoming a key determinant for tailored therapeutic approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the rapid expansion of the organoid field and its applications, there is an increasing need for a standardized method to interpret organoid genotypeâ€“phenotype relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intestinal organoids grown from adult stem cells have emerged as prototype 3D organotypic models for studying tissue renewal and homeostasis. Owing to their strict dependence on Wnt signaling, intestinal organoids offer an unprecedented opportunity to examine Wnt pathway regulation in normal physiology and cancer. We review how alterations in growth factor dependency and organoid morphology can be exploited to identify Wnt signaling mechanisms, characterize mutated pathway components, and predict responses of patient-derived tumors to targeted therapy. We discuss current deficits in the understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships that are to be considered when interpreting mutation-induced changes in organoid morphology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-translational modifications are at the apex of cellular communication and eventually regulate every aspect of life. The identification of new post-translational modifiers is opening alternative avenues in understanding fundamental cell biology processes and may ultimately provide novel therapeutic opportunities. The ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) is a post-translational modifier discovered a decade ago but its biological significance has remained mostly unknown. The field has recently witnessed an explosion of research uncovering the implications of the pathway to cellular homeostasis in living organisms. We overview recent advances in the function and regulation of the UFM1 pathway, and its implications for cell physiology and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune system has the capacity to detect â€™non-selfâ€™ molecules derived from pathogens, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, via pattern recognition receptors. In addition, an increasing number of endogenous host-derived molecules, termed damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), have been found to be sensed by various innate immune receptors. The recognition of DAMPs, which are produced or released by damaged and dying cells, promotes sterile inflammation, which is important for tissue repair and regeneration, but can also lead to the development of numerous inflammatory diseases, such as metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Here we examine recent discoveries concerning the roles of DAMP-sensing receptors in sterile inflammation and in diseases resulting from dysregulated sterile inflammation, and then discuss insights into the cross-regulation of these receptors and their ligands.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an indispensable tool for transcriptome-wide analysis of differential gene expression and differential splicing of mRNAs. However, as next-generation sequencing technologies have developed, so too has RNA-seq. Now, RNA-seq methods are available for studying many different aspects of RNA biology, including single-cell gene expression, translation (the translatome) and RNA structure (the structurome). Exciting new applications are being explored, such as spatial transcriptomics (spatialomics). Together with new long-read and direct RNA-seq technologies and better computational tools for data analysis, innovations in RNA-seq are contributing to a fuller understanding of RNA biology, from questions such as when and where transcription occurs to the folding and intermolecular interactions that govern RNA function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Caspases in Cell Death, Inflammation, and Disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caspases are an evolutionary conserved family of cysteine proteases that are centrally involved in cell death and inflammation responses. A wealth of foundational insight into the molecular mechanisms that control caspase activation has emerged in recent years. Important advancements include the identification of additional inflammasome platforms and pathways that regulate activation of inflammatory caspases; the discovery of gasdermin D as the effector of pyroptosis and interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 secretion; and the existence of substantial crosstalk between inflammatory and apoptotic initiator caspases. A better understanding of the mechanisms regulating caspase activation has supported initial efforts to modulate dysfunctional cell death and inflammation pathways in a suite of communicable, inflammatory, malignant, metabolic, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review current understanding of caspase biology with a prime focus on the inflammatory caspases and outline important topics for future experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumour-associated neutrophils in patients with cancer</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/31160735/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role and importance of neutrophils in cancer has become increasingly apparent over the past decade. Neutrophils accumulate in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer, especially in those with advanced-stage disease, and a high circulating neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a robust biomarker of poor clinical outcome in various cancers. To date, most studies investigating the role of neutrophils in cancer have involved animal models or investigated the function of circulating human neutrophils. Thus, only limited information is available on the roles of intratumoural neutrophils (also known as tumour-associated neutrophils (TANs)) in patients with cancer. In this Review, we initially describe the evidence correlating the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with prognosis, followed by a discussion on the predictive value of TANs, which remains debatable, with conflicting data from different cancer types, including variations based on neutrophil location within and/or around the tumour. We then explore available data on the implications of TAN phenotypes and functions for cancer development and progression, highlighting the reported effects of various treatments on TANs and how neutrophils might affect therapeutic efficacy. Finally, we examine the various compounds capable of modulating neutrophils and suggest future research directions that might ultimately enable the manipulation of TANs in patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active cell death, in its many forms, is a fundamental biological process. Studies over the past several decades have explored the functions and consequences of cellular demise and elucidated several of the key cell death pathways. Here, I pose five questions, or riddles, that might provide a guide to the next decade of cell death research. Focusing mainly on four types of active cell death (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis) mainly in mammals, this Perspective explores the possible research directions that might answer these riddles, or at least prompt new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Innate immunity to intracellular LPS</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/30962589/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring of the cytosolic compartment by the innate immune system for pathogen-encoded products or pathogen activities often enables the activation of a subset of caspases. In most cases, the cytosolic surveillance pathways are coupled to activation of caspase-1 via canonical inflammasome complexes. A related set of caspases, caspase-11 in rodents and caspase-4 and caspase-5 in humans, monitors the cytosol for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Direct activation of caspase-11, caspase-4 and caspase-5 by intracellular LPS elicits the lytic cell death called â€˜pyroptosisâ€™, which occurs in multiple cell types. The pyroptosis is executed by the pore-forming protein GSDMD, which is activated by cleavage mediated by caspase-11, caspase-4 or caspase-5. In monocytes, formation of GSDMD pores can induce activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome for maturation of the cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18. Caspase-11-mediated pyroptosis in response to cytosolic LPS is critical for antibacterial defense and septic shock. Here we review the emerging literature on the sensing of cytosolic LPS and its regulation and pathophysiological functions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells may die from accidental cell death (ACD) or regulated cell death (RCD). ACD is a biologically uncontrolled process, whereas RCD involves tightly structured signaling cascades and molecularly defined effector mechanisms. A growing number of novel non-apoptotic forms of RCD have been identified and are increasingly being implicated in various human pathologies. Here, we critically review the current state of the art regarding non-apoptotic types of RCD, including necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, entotic cell death, netotic cell death, parthanatos, lysosome-dependent cell death, autophagy-dependent cell death, alkaliptosis and oxeiptosis. The in-depth comprehension of each of these lethal subroutines and their intercellular consequences may uncover novel therapeutic targets for the avoidance of pathogenic cell loss.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diverging inflammasome signals in tumorigenesis and potential targeting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammasomes are molecular platforms that assemble upon sensing various intracellular stimuli. Inflammasome assembly leads to activation of caspase 1, thereby promoting the secretion of bioactive interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) and IL-18 and inducing an inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis. Effectors of the inflammasome efficiently drive an immune response, primarily providing protection against microbial infections and mediating control over sterile insults. However, aberrant inflammasome signalling is associated with pathogenesis of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration and malignancies. Chronic inflammation perpetuated by inflammasome activation plays a central role in all stages of tumorigenesis, including immunosuppression, proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. Conversely, inflammasome signalling also contributes to tumour suppression by maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, which portrays the diverse roles of inflammasomes in tumorigenesis. Studies have underscored the importance of environmental factors, such as diet and gut microbiota, in inflammasome signalling, which in turn influences tumorigenesis. In this Review, we deliver an overview of the interplay between inflammasomes and tumorigenesis and discuss their potential as therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are the leading platform for gene delivery for the treatment of a variety of human diseases. Recent advances in developing clinically desirable AAV capsids, optimizing genome designs and harnessing revolutionary biotechnologies have contributed substantially to the growth of the gene therapy field. Preclinical and clinical successes in AAV-mediated gene replacement, gene silencing and gene editing have helped AAV gain popularity as the ideal therapeutic vector, with two AAV-based therapeutics gaining regulatory approval in Europe or the United States. Continued study of AAV biology and increased understanding of the associated therapeutic challenges and limitations will build the foundation for future clinical success.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MicroRNA are major regulators of neuronal gene expression at the post-transcriptional and translational levels. This layer of control is critical for spatially and temporally restricted gene expression, facilitating highly dynamic changes to cellular structure and function associated with neural plasticity. Investigation of microRNA function in the neural system, however, is at an early stage, and many aspects of the mechanisms employing these small non-coding RNAs remain unclear. In this article, we critically review current knowledge pertaining to microRNA function in neural activity, with emphasis on mechanisms of microRNA repression, their subcellular remodelling and functional impacts on neural plasticity and behavioural phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transposons are major genome constituents that can mobilize and trigger mutations, DNA breaks and chromosome rearrangements. Transposon silencing is particularly important in the germline, which is dedicated to transmission of the inherited genome. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) guide a host defence system that transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally silences transposons during germline development. While germline control of transposons by the piRNA pathway is conserved, many piRNA pathway genes are evolving rapidly under positive selection, and the piRNA biogenesis machinery shows remarkable phylogenetic diversity. Conservation of core function combined with rapid gene evolution is characteristic of a host-pathogen arms race, suggesting that transposons and the piRNA pathway are engaged in an evolutionary tug of war that is driving divergence of the biogenesis machinery. Recent studies suggest that this process may produce biochemical incompatibilities that contribute to reproductive isolation and species divergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences in lung anatomy between mice and humans, as well as frequently disappointing results when using animal models for drug discovery, emphasise the unmet need for in vitro models that can complement animal studies and improve our understanding of human lung physiology, regeneration and disease. Recent papers have highlighted the use of three-dimensional organoids and organs-on-a-chip to mimic tissue morphogenesis and function in vitro Here, we focus on the respiratory system and provide an overview of these in vitro models, which can be derived from primary lung cells and pluripotent stem cells, as well as healthy or diseased lungs. We emphasise their potential application in studies of respiratory development, regeneration and disease modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many processes in the human body â€” including brain function â€” are regulated over the 24-hour cycle, and there are strong associations between disrupted circadian rhythms (for example, sleepâ€“wake cycles) and disorders of the CNS. Brain disorders such as autism, depression and Parkinson disease typically develop at certain stages of life, and circadian rhythms are important during each stage of life for the regulation of processes that may influence the development of these disorders. Here, we describe circadian disruptions observed in various brain disorders throughout the human lifespan and highlight emerging evidence suggesting these disruptions affect the brain. Currently, much of the evidence linking brain disorders and circadian dysfunction is correlational, and so whether and what kind of causal relationships might exist are unclear. We therefore identify remaining questions that may direct future research towards a better understanding of the links between circadian disruption and CNS disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In animals, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) of 21-35 nucleotides in length silence transposable elements, regulate gene expression and fight viral infection. piRNAs guide PIWI proteins to cleave target RNA, promote heterochromatin assembly and methylate DNA. The architecture of the piRNA pathway allows it both to provide adaptive, sequence-based immunity to rapidly evolving viruses and transposons and to regulate conserved host genes. piRNAs silence transposons in the germ line of most animals, whereas somatic piRNA functions have been lost, gained and lost again across evolution. Moreover, most piRNA pathway proteins are deeply conserved, but different animals employ remarkably divergent strategies to produce piRNA precursor transcripts. Here, we discuss how a common piRNA pathway allows animals to recognize diverse targets, ranging from selfish genetic elements to genes essential for gametogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Principles of DNA methylation and their implications for biology and medicine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA methylation represents an annotation system for marking the genetic text, thus providing instruction as to how and when to read the information and control transcription. Unlike sequence information, which is inherited, methylation patterns are established in a programmed process that continues throughout development, thus setting up stable gene expression profiles. This DNA methylation paradigm is a key player in medicine. Some changes in methylation closely correlate with age providing a marker for biological ageing, and these same sites could also play a part in cancer. The genome continues to undergo programmed variation in methylation after birth in response to environmental inputs, serving as a memory device that could affect ageing and predisposition to various metabolic, autoimmune, and neurological diseases. Taking advantage of tissue-specific differences, methylation can be used to detect cell death and thereby monitor many common diseases with a simple cell-free circulating-DNA blood test.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial medicine in the omics era</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are dynamic bioenergetic organelles whose maintenance requires around 1500 proteins from two genomes. Mutations in either the mitochondrial or nuclear genome can disrupt a plethora of cellular metabolic and homoeostatic functions. Mitochondrial diseases represent one of the most common and severe groups of inherited genetic disorders, characterised by clinical, biochemical, and genetic heterogeneity, diagnostic odysseys, and absence of disease-modifying curative therapies. This Review aims to discuss recent advances in mitochondrial biology and medicine arising from widespread use of high-throughput omics technologies, and also includes a broad discussion of emerging therapies for mitochondrial disease. New insights into both bioenergetic and biosynthetic mitochondrial functionalities have expedited the genetic diagnosis of primary mitochondrial disorders, and identified novel mitochondrial pathomechanisms and new targets for therapeutic intervention. As we enter this new era of mitochondrial medicine, underpinned by global unbiased approaches and multifaceted investigation of mitochondrial function, omics technologies will continue to shed light on unresolved mitochondrial questions, paving the way for improved outcomes for patients with mitochondrial diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Best practices for analysing microbiomes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex microbial communities shape the dynamics of various environments, ranging from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract to the soil. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies and data analysis have provided drastic improvements in microbiome analyses, for example, in taxonomic resolution, false discovery rate control and other properties, over earlier methods. In this Review, we discuss the best practices for performing a microbiome study, including experimental design, choice of molecular analysis technology, methods for data analysis and the integration of multiple omics data sets. We focus on recent findings that suggest that operational taxonomic unit-based analyses should be replaced with new methods that are based on exact sequence variants, methods for integrating metagenomic and metabolomic data, and issues surrounding compositional data analysis, where advances have been particularly rapid. We note that although some of these approaches are new, it is important to keep sight of the classic issues that arise during experimental design and relate to research reproducibility. We describe how keeping these issues in mind allows researchers to obtain more insight from their microbiome data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RNA N6-methyladenosine modification in cancers: current status and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/29686311/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A), the most abundant internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs), has been shown to play critical roles in various normal bioprocesses such as tissue development, stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, heat shock or DNA damage response, and maternal-to-zygotic transition. The m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification is deposited by the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methyltransferase complex (MTC; i.e., writer) composed of METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP, and probably also VIRMA and RBM15, and can be removed by m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A demethylases (i.e., erasers) such as FTO and ALKBH5. The fates of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-modified mRNAs rely on the functions of distinct proteins that recognize them (i.e., readers), which may affect the stability, splicing, and/or translation of target mRNAs. Given the functional importance of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification machinery in normal bioprocesses, it is not surprising that evidence is emerging that dysregulation of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification and the associated proteins also contributes to the initiation, progression, and drug response of cancers. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the study of biological functions and the underlying molecular mechanisms of dysregulated m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification and the associated machinery in the pathogenesis and drug response of various types of cancers. In addition, we also discuss possible therapeutic interventions against the dysregulated m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A machinery to treat cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By exerting pro- and anti-tumorigenic actions, tumor-infiltrating immune cells can profoundly influence tumor progression, as well as the success of anti-cancer therapies. Therefore, the quantification of tumor-infiltrating immune cells holds the promise to unveil the multi-faceted role of the immune system in human cancers and its involvement in tumor escape mechanisms and response to therapy. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can be quantified from RNA sequencing data of human tumors using bioinformatics approaches. In this review, we describe state-of-the-art computational methods for the quantification of immune cells from transcriptomics data and discuss the open challenges that must be addressed to accurately quantify immune infiltrates from RNA sequencing data of human bulk tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular mechanisms of cell death: recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death 2018</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (NCCD) has formulated guidelines for the definition and interpretation of cell death from morphological, biochemical, and functional perspectives. Since the field continues to expand and novel mechanisms that orchestrate multiple cell death pathways are unveiled, we propose an updated classification of cell death subroutines focusing on mechanistic and essential (as opposed to correlative and dispensable) aspects of the process. As we provide molecularly oriented definitions of terms including intrinsic apoptosis, extrinsic apoptosis, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-driven necrosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, parthanatos, entotic cell death, NETotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, autophagy-dependent cell death, immunogenic cell death, cellular senescence, and mitotic catastrophe, we discuss the utility of neologisms that refer to highly specialized instances of these processes. The mission of the NCCD is to provide a widely accepted nomenclature on cell death in support of the continued development of the field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Expanding Landscape of Alternative Splicing Variation in Human Populations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative splicing is a tightly regulated biological process by which the number of gene products for any given gene can be greatly expanded. Genomic variants in splicing regulatory sequences can disrupt splicing and cause disease. Recent developments in sequencing technologies and computational biology have allowed researchers to investigate alternative splicing at an unprecedented scale and resolution. Population-scale transcriptome studies have revealed many naturally occurring genetic variants that modulate alternative splicing and consequently influence phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility in human populations. Innovations in experimental and computational tools such as massively parallel reporter assays and deep learning have enabled the rapid screening of genomic variants for their causal impacts on splicing. In this review, we describe technological advances that have greatly increased the speed and scale at which discoveries are made about the genetic variation of alternative splicing. We summarize major findings from population transcriptomic studies of alternative splicing and discuss the implications of these findings for human genetics and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics and chemogenetics comprise a wide variety of applications in which genetically encoded actuators and indicators are used to modulate and monitor activity with high cellular specificity. Over the past 10 years, development of these genetically encoded tools has contributed tremendously to our understanding of integrated physiology. In concert with the continued refinement of probes, strategies to target transgene expression to specific cell types have also made much progress in the past 20 years. In addition, the successful implementation of optogenetic and chemogenetic techniques thrives thanks to ongoing advances in live imaging microscopy and optical technology. Although innovation of optogenetic and chemogenetic methods has been primarily driven by researchers studying the central nervous system, these techniques also hold great promise to boost research in neurogastroenterology. In this Review, we describe the different classes of tools that are currently available and give an overview of the strategies to target them to specific cell types in the gut wall. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of optogenetic and chemogenetic technology in the gut and provide an overview of their current use, with a focus on the enteric nervous system. Furthermore, we suggest some experiments that can advance our understanding of how the intrinsic and extrinsic neural networks of the gut control gastrointestinal function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ferroptosis: A Regulated Cell Death Nexus Linking Metabolism, Redox Biology, and Disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/28985560/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides to lethal levels. Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis represents an ancient vulnerability caused by the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into cellular membranes, and cells have developed complex systems that exploit and defend against this vulnerability in different contexts. The sensitivity to ferroptosis is tightly linked to numerous biological processes, including amino acid, iron, and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism, and the biosynthesis of glutathione, phospholipids, NADPH, and coenzyme Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. Ferroptosis has been implicated in the pathological cell death associated with degenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s, Huntington&amp;rsquo;s, and Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s diseases), carcinogenesis, stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and kidney degeneration in mammals and is also implicated in heat stress in plants. Ferroptosis may also have a tumor-suppressor function that could be harnessed for cancer therapy. This Primer reviews the mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, highlights connections to other areas of biology and medicine, and recommends tools and guidelines for studying this emerging form of regulated cell death.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeting neural reflex circuits in immunity to treat kidney disease</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/28970585/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural circuits that control immunity and inflammation provide novel targets for the treatment of kidney disease and hypertension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) blocks splenic-dependent systemic inflammation and acute kidney injury (AKI); non-invasive, nonpharmacological approaches to activate the CAP include ultrasound application and vagus nerve stimulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural circuits that directly regulate kidney function or carry sensory feedback from the kidney to the central nervous system could provide additional mechanisms for bidirectional neuroimmunomodulation of kidney disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactions between neural circuits and the immune system have important roles in the pathogenesis of hypertension and renal fibrosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further defining neuroimmunomodulatory pathways in hypertension could enable the development of selective neuronal stimulatory or inhibitory strategies for lowering blood pressure that could potentially be more effective than renal denervation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optogenetic tools provide unprecedented opportunities to dissect the neural pathways that control immunity and inflammation and enable the identification of novel approaches to therapy for kidney diseases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural pathways regulate immunity and inflammation via the inflammatory reflex and specific molecular targets can be modulated by stimulating neurons. Neuroimmunomodulation by nonpharmacological methods is emerging as a novel therapeutic strategy for inflammatory diseases, including kidney diseases and hypertension. Electrical stimulation of vagus neurons or treatment with pulsed ultrasound activates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) and protects mice from acute kidney injury (AKI). Direct innervation of the kidney, by afferent and efferent neurons, might have a role in modulating and responding to inflammation in various diseases, either locally or by providing feedback to regions of the central nervous system that are important in the inflammatory reflex pathway. Increased sympathetic drive to the kidney has a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, and selective modulation of neuroimmune interactions in the kidney could potentially be more effective for lowering blood pressure and treating inflammatory kidney diseases than renal denervation. Use of optogenetic tools for selective stimulation of specific neurons has enabled the identification of neural circuits in the brain that modulate kidney function via activation of the CAP. In this Review we discuss evidence for a role of neural circuits in the control of renal inflammation as well as the therapeutic potential of targeting these circuits in the settings of AKI, kidney fibrosis and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Putting p53 in Context</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. Functionally, p53 is activated by a host of stress stimuli and, in turn, governs an exquisitely complex anti-proliferative transcriptional program that touches upon a bewildering array of biological responses. Despite the many unveiled facets of the p53 network, a clear appreciation of how and in what contexts p53 exerts its diverse effects remains unclear. How can we interpret p53&amp;rsquo;s disparate activities and the consequences of its dysfunction to understand how cell type, mutation profile, and epigenetic cell state dictate outcomes, and how might we restore its tumor-suppressive activities in cancer?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging Roles for the Lysosome in Lipid Metabolism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise regulation of lipid biosynthesis, transport, and storage is key to the homeostasis of cells and organisms. Cells rely on a sophisticated but poorly understood network of vesicular and nonvesicular transport mechanisms to ensure efficient delivery of lipids to target organelles. The lysosome stands at the crossroads of this network due to its ability to process and sort exogenous and endogenous lipids. The lipid-sorting function of the lysosome is intimately connected to its recently discovered role as a metabolic command-and-control center, which relays multiple nutrient cues to the master growth regulator, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)1 kinase. In turn, mTORC1 potently drives anabolic processes, including de novo lipid synthesis, while inhibiting lipid catabolism. Here, we describe the dual role of the lysosome in lipid transport and biogenesis, and we discuss how integration of these two processes may play important roles both in normal physiology and in disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programmed Cell Death and Inflammation: Winter Is Coming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of an organism requires the assistance of an unlikely process: programmed cell death. Both development and the maintenance of homeostasis result in the production of superfluous cells that must eventually be disposed of. Furthermore, programmed cell death can also represent a defense mechanism; for example, by depriving pathogens of a replication niche. The responsibility of handling these dead cells falls on phagocytes of the immune system, which surveil their surroundings for dying or dead cells and efficiently clear them in a quiescent manner. This process, termed efferocytosis, depends on cooperation between the phagocyte and the dying cell. In this review we explore different types of programmed cell death and their impact on innate immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choices have consequences. Immune cells survey and migrate throughout the body and sometimes take residence in niche environments with distinct communities of cells, extracellular matrix, and nutrients that may differ from those in which they matured. Imbedded in immune cell physiology are metabolic pathways and metabolites that not only provide energy and substrates for growth and survival, but also instruct effector functions, differentiation, and gene expression. This review of immunometabolism will reference the most recent literature to cover the choices that environments impose on the metabolism and function of immune cells and highlight their consequences during homeostasis and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organoids are 3D in vitro culture systems derived from self-organizing stem cells. They can recapitulate the in vivo architecture, functionality, and genetic signature of original tissues. Thus, organoid technology has been rapidly applied to understanding stem cell biology, organogenesis, and various human pathologies. The recent development of human patient-derived organoids has enabled disease modeling with precision, highlighting their great potential in biomedical applications, translational medicine, and personalized therapy. In light of recent breakthroughs using organoids, it is only apt that we appreciate the advantages and shortcomings of this technology to exploit its full potential. We discuss recent advances in the application of organoids in studying cancer and hereditary diseases, as well as in the examination of host cell-microorganism interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lungs are composed of a system of highly branched tubes that bring air into the alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. The proximal and distal regions of the lung contain epithelial cells specialized for different functions: basal, secretory and ciliated cells in the conducting airways and type II and type I cells lining the alveoli. Basal, secretory and type II cells can be grown in three-dimensional culture, with or without supporting stromal cells, and under these conditions they give rise to self-organizing structures known as organoids. This Review summarizes the different methods for generating organoids from cells isolated from human and mouse lungs, and compares their final structure and cellular composition with that of the airways or alveoli of the adult lung. We also discuss the potential and limitations of organoids for addressing outstanding questions in lung biology and for developing new drugs for disorders such as cystic fibrosis and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) coordinates eukaryotic cell growth and metabolism with environmental inputs, including nutrients and growth factors. Extensive research over the past two decades has established a central role for mTOR in regulating many fundamental cell processes, from protein synthesis to autophagy, and deregulated mTOR signaling is implicated in the progression of cancer and diabetes, as well as the aging process. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of mTOR function, regulation, and importance in mammalian physiology. We also highlight how the mTOR signaling network contributes to human disease and discuss the current and future prospects for therapeutically targeting mTOR in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metastases account for the great majority of cancer-associated deaths, yet this complex process remains the least understood aspect of cancer biology. As the body of research concerning metastasis continues to grow at a rapid rate, the biological programs that underlie the dissemination and metastatic outgrowth of cancer cells are beginning to come into view. In this review we summarize the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in metastasis, with a focus on carcinomas where the most is known, and we highlight the general principles of metastasis that have begun to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spread of the Western lifestyle has been accompanied by microbial changes thought to underlie the emergence of chronic, nontransmissible, immune-related diseases. The past decade has seen the unprecedented development of therapies for &amp;lsquo;replenishing&amp;rsquo; the microbiota of sick individuals. However, functional and ecological solutions helping the host and the gut microbiota to cope with the ecological stressors of modern life are still lacking. In this review, we discuss how recent advances in gut microbiome science are leading to the identification of microbe-derived and health-relevant metabolites. These molecules will guide the selection of the next-generation of probiotics and dietary recommendations, which should also take the resident gut microbiota into account, to optimise efficacy. These solutions for maintaining a well-functioning gut ecosystem and promoting good health should be customised, palatable, and as widely accessible as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transcriptional regulator STAT3 has key roles in vertebrate development and mature tissue function including control of inflammation and immunity. Mutations in human STAT3 associate with diseases such as immunodeficiency, autoimmunity and cancer. Strikingly, however, either hyperactivation or inactivation of STAT3 results in human disease, indicating tightly regulated STAT3 function is central to health. Here, we attempt to summarize information on the numerous and distinct biological actions of STAT3, and highlight recent discoveries, with a specific focus on STAT3 function in the immune and hematopoietic systems. Our goal is to spur investigation on mechanisms by which aberrant STAT3 function drives human disease and novel approaches that might be used to modulate disease outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two decades of studies in multiple model organisms have established the Hippo pathway as a key regulator of organ size and tissue homeostasis. By inhibiting YAP and TAZ transcription co-activators, the Hippo pathway regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and stemness in response to a wide range of extracellular and intracellular signals, including cell-cell contact, cell polarity, mechanical cues, ligands of G-protein-coupled receptors, and cellular energy status. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway exerts a significant impact on cancer development. Further investigation of the functions and regulatory mechanisms of this pathway will help uncovering the mystery of organ size control and identify new targets for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process in eukaryotes that eliminates harmful components and maintains cellular homeostasis in response to a series of extracellular insults. However, these insults may trigger the downstream signaling of another prominent stress responsive pathway, the STAT3 signaling pathway, which has been implicated in multiple aspects of the autophagic process. Recent reports further indicate that different subcellular localization patterns of STAT3 affect autophagy in various ways. For example, nuclear STAT3 fine-tunes autophagy via the transcriptional regulation of several autophagy-related genes such as BCL2 family members, BECN1, PIK3C3, CTSB, CTSL, PIK3R1, HIF1A, BNIP3, and microRNAs with targets of autophagy modulators. Cytoplasmic STAT3 constitutively inhibits autophagy by sequestering EIF2AK2 as well as by interacting with other autophagy-related signaling molecules such as FOXO1 and FOXO3. Additionally, the mitochondrial translocation of STAT3 suppresses autophagy induced by oxidative stress and may effectively preserve mitochondria from being degraded by mitophagy. Understanding the role of STAT3 signaling in the regulation of autophagy may provide insight into the classic autophagy model and also into cancer therapy, especially for the emerging targeted therapy, because a series of targeted agents execute antitumor activities via blocking STAT3 signaling, which inevitably affects the autophagy pathway. Here, we review several of the representative studies and the current understanding in this particular field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is an intracellular self-digestion mechanism, by which cellular components are sorted into double-membrane autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Cells use autophagy to dispose of wastes and eliminate hazards, while recycling nutrients and tuning metabolism in the process. Through these functions, autophagy promotes cell fitness, genome integrity, tissue homeostasis, and cell survival and growth under stress. Both autophagy upregulation and downregulation have been found in human cancers, suggesting a complex role in tumor development. Accumulating results from autophagy-deficient mice and mouse models of human cancers have demonstrated that autophagy generally suppresses tumor initiation, but promotes tumor progression, in a manner that is dependent on timing and context and modified by specific tumorigenic events. Given the role of autophagy in facilitating tumor growth, autophagy inhibition has gained wide attention as a potential anticancer therapy. Here, we summarize relevant genetic, preclinical, and clinical studies and discuss the multifaceted role of autophagy in cancer, as well as the prospects of autophagy inhibition for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a point of convergence for numerous oncogenic signaling pathways, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is central in regulating the anti-tumor immune response. STAT3 is broadly hyperactivated both in cancer and non-cancerous cells within the tumor ecosystem and plays important roles in inhibiting the expression of crucial immune activation regulators and promoting the production of immunosuppressive factors. Therefore, targeting the STAT3 signaling pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for numerous cancers. In this review, we outline the importance of STAT3 signaling pathway in tumorigenesis and its immune regulation, and highlight the current status for the development of STAT3-targeting therapeutic approaches. We also summarize and discuss recent advances in STAT3-based combination immunotherapy in detail. These endeavors provide new insights into the translational application of STAT3 in cancer and may contribute to the promotion of more effective treatments toward malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death. This deterioration is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is controlled, at least to some extent, by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This Review enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging in different organisms, with special emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks are: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks and their relative contributions to aging, with the final goal of identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during aging, with minimal side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anoikis: an emerging hallmark in health and diseases</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/21953325/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anoikis is a programmed cell death occurring upon cell detachment from the correct extracellular matrix, thus disrupting integrin ligation. It is a critical mechanism in preventing dysplastic cell growth or attachment to an inappropriate matrix. Anoikis prevents detached epithelial cells from colonizing elsewhere and is thus essential for tissue homeostasis and development. As anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, two features associated with anoikis resistance, are crucial steps during tumour progression and metastatic spreading of cancer cells, anoikis deregulation has now evoked particular attention from the scientific community. The aim of this review is to analyse the molecular mechanisms governing both anoikis and anoikis resistance, focusing on their regulation in physiological processes, as well as in several diseases, including metastatic cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crosstalk between mitophagy and innate immunity in viral infection</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36590405/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are important organelles involved in cell metabolism and programmed cell death in eukaryotic cells and are closely related to the innate immunity of host cells against viruses. Mitophagy is a process in which phagosomes selectively phagocytize damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria to form autophagosomes and is degraded by lysosomes, which control mitochondrial mass and maintain mitochondrial dynamics and cellular homeostasis. Innate immunity is an important part of the immune system and plays a vital role in eliminating viruses. Viral infection causes many physiological and pathological alterations in host cells, including mitophagy and innate immune pathways. Accumulating evidence suggests that some virus promote self-replication through regulating mitophagy-mediated innate immunity. Clarifying the regulatory relationships among mitochondria, mitophagy, innate immunity, and viral infection will shed new insight for pathogenic mechanisms and antiviral strategies. This review systemically summarizes the activation pathways of mitophagy and the relationship between mitochondria and innate immune signaling pathways, and then discusses the mechanisms of viruses on mitophagy and innate immunity and how viruses promote self-replication by regulating mitophagy-mediated innate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sepsis-induced immunosuppression: mechanisms, diagnosis and current treatment options</title>
      <link>https://example.com/review/36209190/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a common complication of combat injuries and trauma, and is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It is also one of the significant causes of death and increased health care costs in modern intensive care units. The use of antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and organ support therapy have limited prognostic impact in patients with sepsis. Although its pathophysiology remains elusive, immunosuppression is now recognized as one of the major causes of septic death. Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is resulted from disruption of immune homeostasis. It is characterized by the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, abnormal death of immune effector cells, hyperproliferation of immune suppressor cells, and expression of immune checkpoints. By targeting immunosuppression, especially with immune checkpoint inhibitors, preclinical studies have demonstrated the reversal of immunocyte dysfunctions and established host resistance. Here, we comprehensively discuss recent findings on the mechanisms, regulation and biomarkers of sepsis-induced immunosuppression and highlight their implications for developing effective strategies to treat patients with septic shock.&lt;/p&gt;
